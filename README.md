Author: Wouter Eekhout - Solution for #LinksSDGs

The study provides an overview of the various links between the sustainable development goals throughout key policy documents - with a specific focus on the message that relates to urban development (SDG 11).For this purpose, we have developed an automated classifier to identify how certain texts relate to specific aspects and how these focus areas might be addressed in relation to each other. The classifier has been trained on the basis of the formulation of SDGs and their pertaining targets.
