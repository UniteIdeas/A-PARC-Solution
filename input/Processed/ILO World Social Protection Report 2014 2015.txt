Preface

S

ince its creation in 1919, the ILO has been supporting countries to develop and implement social security systems for all. There has been tremendous progress since
then. At the outset, some 40 countries were starting to build such schemes; today, all
countries in the world have a social security system.
What is more, social protection coverage and benefits continue to expand, as reflected in the groundbreaking ILO Recommendation concerning National Floors of
Social Protection (No. 202), adopted in 2012. The Recommendation bears witness to
the joint commitment of governments, employers and workers to building nationally
defined social protection floors which guarantee at least a basic level of social security
to all, encompassing access to health care and income security throughout people’s lives
and ensuring their dignity and rights. While social protection floors are essential, the
Recommendation does not stop there: it also sets out detailed guidance on building
comprehensive social protection systems.
Two years after the adoption of the Recommendation, this World Social Protection
Report offers a comprehensive body of evidence both on the impressive progress made
over the last few years and on the remaining gaps that need to be filled. Based on a lifecycle approach, the report provides an overview of the current organization of social
protection systems, coverage, benefits and expenditures. With its global scope and
valuable statistical annexes, it is an essential reference for anyone interested in social
protection.
In recent years, the ILO has provided technical assistance on social protection to no
fewer than 136 countries. And we are proud to continue our support all over the world,
as more and more evidence shows that social protection systems play a key role in the
functioning of modern societies and are an essential ingredient of integrated strategies
for economic and social development. Furthermore, experience since 2008 shows that
countries with adequate social protection systems were able to respond more quickly
and effectively to the global crisis.
Yet some 73 per cent of the world’s population continues to live without adequate
social protection coverage. In other words, for the large majority of people the fundamental human right to social security is only partially realized or not at all. In
2014, it is clear that the global community needs to make greater efforts in realizing this right. With this in view, it is opportune to recall the many countries that

v

vi

historically have built sound economies at the same time as decent societies with
social protection.
Still grappling with the economic repercussions of the global financial crisis, the
world is faced with a deep social crisis which is also a crisis of social justice. Fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures threaten household living standards in a significant number of countries. Despite progress made in reducing levels of extreme poverty
in some parts of the world, high levels of poverty and vulnerability persist; what is
more, poverty is actually increasing in many high-income countries. In addition, high
and still rising levels of inequality in both advanced and developing economies are
widely acknowledged as cause for great concern.
Social protection measures are essential elements of a policy response that can address those challenges. They not only support the realization of the universal human
right to social security, but are both a social and an economic necessity. Well-designed
social protection systems support incomes and domestic consumption, build human
capital and increase productivity. The bold efforts in extending social protection in
many developing countries, from Brazil to China, from Ecuador to Mozambique, have
underlined its key role in reducing poverty and vulnerability, redressing inequality and
boosting inclusive growth.
This is an issue that the international community should embrace as a priority in
the post-2015 development agenda. Social protection can ensure that all people have
the security of knowing that if they lose their job or fall ill, and also when they grow
old, they will not face the risk of poverty and insecurity. Our modern society can afford
to provide universal social protection everywhere.
I hope that this report will be a useful tool for practitioners, and provide the basis
for better informed policy-making.

ocial protection policies play a critical role in realizing the human right to social security for all, reducing poverty and inequality, and supporting inclusive
growth – by boosting human capital and productivity,
supporting domestic demand and facilitating structural
transformation of national economies. This ILO flagship report: (i) provides a global overview of the organization of social protection systems, their coverage
and benefits, as well as public expenditures on social
security; (ii) following a life-cycle approach, presents
social protection for children, for women and men of
working age, and for older persons; (iii) analyses trends
and recent policies, e.g. negative impacts of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures; and (iv) calls for
the expansion of social protection in pursuit of crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice.
While the need for social protection is widely recognized, the fundamental human right to social security
remains unfulfilled for the large majority of the world’s
population. Only 27 per cent of the global population
enjoy access to comprehensive social security systems,
whereas 73 per cent are covered partially or not at all.
The lack of access to social protection constitutes
a major obstacle to economic and social development.
Inadequate or absent social protection coverage is associated with high and persistent levels of poverty and
economic insecurity, growing levels of inequality, insufficient investments in human capital and human
capabilities, and weak aggregate demand in a time of
recession and slow growth.
The strong positive impacts of social protection
have brought social protection to the forefront of the

development agenda. Social protection is a key element
of national strategies to promote human development,
political stability and inclusive growth. The ILO Social
Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202),
reflects a consensus on the extension of social security
reached among governments and employers’ and
workers’ organizations from 185 countries at all levels of
development. Further, the roll-out of social protection
floors is endorsed by the G20 and the United Nations.
However, while there has been a global trend towards the extension of social protection, particularly
in middle-income countries, the effectiveness of social
security systems in a number of countries is at risk as a
result of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures.
These trends are presented in the different chapters of
the report, following a life-cycle approach.

Social protection for children
and families: A right unfulfilled
Social protection policies are an essential element of
realizing children’s rights, ensuring their well-being,
breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and vulnerability, and helping all children realize their full potential.
­Despite a large expansion of schemes, existing social
protection policies do not sufficiently address the
income security needs of children and families, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with large
child populations. About 18,000 children die every day,
mainly from preventable causes: many of these deaths
could be averted through adequate social protection.

Social protection also has a key role in preventing
child labour by reducing economic vulnerability of
families, enabling children to go to school and protecting them from exploitation.
More efforts are needed to step up measures to ensure
income security for children and families. Many children do not receive the essential cash transfers that could
make a real difference, in terms of nutrition, health, education and care services, to their chances of realizing
their full potential. Specific child and family benefit
programmes rooted in legislation exist in 108 countries,
yet often cover only small groups of the population. In
75 countries, no such programmes are available at all.
On average, governments allocate 0.4 per cent of
GDP to child and family benefits, ranging from 2.2 per
cent in Western Europe to 0.2  per cent in Africa,
and in Asia and the Pacific. Underinvestment in children jeopardizes their rights and their future, as well
as the economic and social development prospects of
the countries in which they live.
Fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures in
higher-income economies threaten progress on income
security for children and their families. Child poverty
increased in 19 of the 28 countries of the European
Union between 2007 and 2012.

Social protection in working age:
The quest for income security
Social protection plays a key role for women and men
of working age by stabilizing their incomes in the event
of unemployment, employment injury, disability, sickness and maternity, and by ensuring that they have at
least a basic level of income security. While the labour
market serves as the primary source of income security
during working life, social protection plays a major role
in smoothing incomes and aggregate demand, thereby
facilitating structural change within economies.
Worldwide, 2.3 per cent of GDP is allocated to
social protection expenditure for women and men in
ensuring income security during working age; regionally, levels vary widely, ranging from 0.5 per cent in
Africa to 5.9 per cent in Western Europe.
Unemployment protection
Where they exist, unemployment benefit schemes play
a key role in providing income security to workers and
their families in the event of temporary unemployment,

contributing thereby to preventing poverty; supporting
structural change in the economy; providing safeguards
against informalization; and, in the event of a crisis,
stabilizing aggregate demand, helping the economy to
recover more quickly.
However, only 28 per cent of the labour force worldwide is potentially eligible for benefits (contributory
or non-contributory) under existing legislation should
they become unemployed. Within this overall figure,
regional differences are considerable: 80 per cent of the
labour force is so covered in Europe, 38 per cent in Latin
­America, 21 per cent in the Middle East, 17 per cent in
the Asia and Pacific region, and 8 per cent in Africa.
Only 12 per cent of unemployed workers worldwide
­actually receive unemployment benefits, and again regional differences are large, with effective coverage ran­
ging from 64 per cent of unemployed workers in Western
Europe to just over 7 per cent in the Asia and Pacific
region, 5 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean,
and less than 3 per cent in the Middle East and Africa.
A number of emerging economies have introduced
unemployment benefit schemes, such as Bahrain or
Viet Nam, as a means to ensure income security for
unemployed workers and facilitate their search for jobs
matching their skills in the formal economy. India’s
employment guarantee scheme (Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme) also provides a
form of unemployment protection by guaranteeing 100
days of public employment to poor rural households.
Employment injury protection
In 2013, shaken by the Rana Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh, the world became aware that social protection in
case of employment injury is essential to protect workers
and their families from the financial consequences of accidents at work and to facilitate their rehabilitation. At
present, however, only 33.9 per cent of the global labour
force is covered by law for employment injury through
mandatory social insurance. Even if voluntary social insurance coverage and employer liability provisions are
included, only 39.4 per cent of the labour force is covered by law. In practice, actual access to employment
injury protection is even lower, largely owing to incomplete enforcement of the legislation in many countries.
The low coverage of employment injury compensation in many low- and middle-income countries points to
an urgent need to enhance working conditions in respect
of occupational safety and health, as well as improving
employment injury coverage for all workers, including

Contents

Executive summary

those in the informal economy. As more countries move
from employer liability as the basis for employment
injury protection to a mechanism based on social insurance, levels of protection for workers are likely to improve – but only if new laws are effectively enforced.
Disability benefits
Social protection plays a key role in meeting the specific needs of persons with disabilities with regard to
income security, access to health care and social inclusion. Effective measures to support persons with disabilities in finding and retaining quality employment
are a key element of non-discriminatory and inclusive
policies that help to realize their rights and aspirations
as productive members of society.
Complementing contributory schemes, non-contributory disability benefits play a key role in protecting
those persons with disabilities who have not (yet) earned
entitlements to contributory schemes. Only 87 countries offer such non-contributory benefits anchored in
national legislation, which would provide at least a minimum level of income security for those disabled from
birth or before working age, and those who for any reason
have not had the opportunity to contribute to social
insurance for long enough to be eligible for benefits.
Maternity protection
Effective maternity protection ensures income security
for pregnant women and mothers of newborn children
and their families, and also effective access to quality maternal health care. It also promotes equality in
employment and occupation.
Worldwide, less than 40  per cent of women in
employment are covered by law under mandatory maternity cash benefit schemes; 57 per cent if voluntary
coverage (mainly for women in self-employment) is
included. Due to the ineffective enforcement and implementation of the law in some regions (Asia and
the Pacific, Latin America and Africa in particular),
effective coverage is even lower: only 28  per cent
of women in employment worldwide are protected
through maternity cash benefits which provide some
income security in during the final stages of pregnancy
and after childbirth; the absence of income security
forces many women to return to work prematurely.
An increasing number of countries are using noncontributory maternity cash benefits as a means to

improve income security and access to maternal and
child health care for pregnant women and new mothers, particularly for women living in poverty. However,
significant gaps remain.
Ensuring effective access to quality maternal health
care is of particular importance, especially in countries
where the informal economy accounts for a large proportion of employment.

Old-age pensions: A state responsibility
The right to income security in old age, as grounded
in human rights instruments and international labour
standards, includes the right to an adequate pension.
However, nearly half (48 per cent) of all people over
pensionable age do not receive a pension. For many of
those who do receive a pension, pension levels are not
adequate. As a result, the majority of the world’s older
women and men have no income security, have no right
to retire and have to continue working as long as they
can – often badly paid and in precarious conditions.
Under existing laws and regulations, only 42 per cent of
people of working age today can expect to receive social
security pensions in the future, and effective coverage is
expected to be even lower. This gap will have to be filled
also by an expansion of non-contributory provisions.
In recent years, many middle- and low-income countries have made efforts to expand the coverage of
contributory pension schemes and to establish noncontributory pensions so as to guarantee at least basic
income security in old age to all.
At the same time, countries undertaking fiscal consolidation are reforming their pension systems to make
cost savings, by such means as raising the retirement
age, reducing benefits and increasing contribution rates.
These adjustments are reducing state responsibility for
guaranteeing income security in old age and shifting
large parts of the economic risks associated with pension provision on to individuals, thereby undermining
the adequacy of pension systems and reducing their ability to prevent poverty in old age. Future pensioners will
receive lower pensions in at least 14 countries of Europe.
It is important to note that a number of countries
are reversing the earlier privatizations of pension systems, implemented in the 1980s and 1990s. Argentina, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Chile, Hungary,
­Kazakhstan and Poland either have renationalized or
are renationalizing their pension systems to improve
old-age income security.

Towards universal coverage in health

xxiv

The urgency of striving for universal coverage in health
is illustrated by the fact more than 90 per cent of the
population living in low-income  countries remains
without any right to coverage in health. Globally,
39 per cent of the population is lacking such coverage.
As a result, about 40 per cent of all global health expenditure is shouldered directly by the sick. However,
even people who are legally covered experience limited
health benefits, high out-of-pocket payments and a lack
of the health workers needed to deliver services. In
such circumstances, despite coverage, health care is frequently neither available nor affordable, and the cost of
accessing needed services can lead to poverty.
The ILO estimates that there is a global shortfall
of 10.3 million health workers required to ensure that
all in need receive quality health services. This gap, and
the often close-to-poverty wages of health workers, are
blocking progress towards universal health coverage.
Globally, 88 countries in several regions of the world
have proved that it is possible to close the gaps in health
coverage. Many of them began the process of reform at
lower levels of national income and invested in times of
economic crisis. Further, they have shown that countries can achieve high coverage rates and even universal coverage using either tax- or contribution-funded
systems and schemes or a mix of both. However, countries undergoing fiscal consolidation have often initiated health reforms to make cost savings, through such
means as rationalizing the costs of public health facilities, introducing patient co-payments and cutting wage
bills for medical staff. These adjustment measures have
sharpened inequities in access to health care and increased exclusion by shifting the burden from the public
purse to private households.
Investing in health protection, including paid
sick leave, yields returns. However, public expenditure on health is at present too low to be sufficiently
effective: the potential economic returns from increased productivity and employment cannot be realized while gaps in coverage persist. Closing these gaps
would lead to the highest rates of return in the world’s
poorest countries.
Greater joint efforts are necessary to work towards
universal health coverage, and towards the associated
goal of establishing social protection floors, as recently
called for by the UN General Assembly.

Expanding social protection: Key to crisis
recovery and inclusive development
The global financial and economic crisis has forcefully underlined the importance of social security as a
human right, and as an economic and social necessity,
as set out in the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202).
In the first phase of the crisis (2008–09), social
protection played a strong role in the expansionary
response. At least 48 high- and middle-income countries announced fiscal stimulus packages totalling
US$2.4 trillion, of which approximately a quarter was
invested in counter-cyclical social protection measures.
In the second phase of the crisis (2010 onwards),
governments embarked on fiscal consolidation and premature contraction of expenditure, despite an urgent
need of public support among vulnerable populations.
In 2014, the scope of public expenditure adjustment is
expected to intensify significantly: according to IMF
projections, 122 countries – of which 82 are developing countries – will be contracting expenditures in
terms of GDP. Further, a fifth of countries are undergoing excessive fiscal contraction, defined as cutting
public expenditures below pre-crisis levels.
Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolidation measures are not limited to Europe; many developing countries have adopted adjustment measures,
including the elimination or reduction of food and
fuel subsidies; cuts or caps on wages, including for
health and social care workers; rationalizing and more
narrowly targeting social protection benefits; and reforms of pension and health-care systems. Many governments are also considering revenue-side measures,
for example increasing consumption taxes such as
VAT on basic products that are consumed by poor
households.
In developing countries, some of the proceeds of
these adjustments, e.g. from the elimination of subsidies, have been used to design narrowly targeted
safety nets, as a compensatory mechanism to the poorest. However, given the large number of vulnerable
low-income households in developing countries, more
efforts are necessary to increase the fiscal space to meet
the social protection needs of populations.
Of particular significance are the divergent trends
in richer and poorer  countries: while many highincome countries are contracting their social security
systems, many developing countries are expanding them.
High-income countries have reduced a range of
social protection benefits and limited access to quality

Executive summary

public services. Together with persistent unemployment, lower wages and higher taxes, these measures
have contributed to increases in poverty or social
exclusion now affecting 123  million people in the
­European Union, 24 per cent of its population, many
of them children, women, older persons and persons
with disabilities. Several European courts have found
cuts unconstitutional. The cost of adjustment has been
passed on to populations, who have been coping with
fewer jobs and lower income for more than five years.
Depressed household income levels are leading to
lower domestic consumption and lower demand, slowing down recovery. The achievements of the E
­ uropean
social model, which dramatically reduced poverty
and promoted prosperity in the period following the
Second World War, have been eroded by short-term
adjustment reforms.
Many middle-income countries are boldly expanding their social protection systems, thereby contributing to their domestic demand-led growth strategies: this
presents a powerful developmental lesson. China, for
instance, has achieved nearly universal coverage of pensions and increased wages; Brazil accelerated the expansion of social protection coverage and minimum wages

since 2009. Continued commitment is necessary to address persistent inequalities.
Some lower-income countries have extended social
protection mainly through temporary safety nets with
very low benefit levels. However, in many of these countries debates are under way on building social protection floors as part of comprehensive social protection
systems.
The case for social protection is compelling in our
times. Social protection realizes the human right to
social security and is a key element of sound economic
policy. Social protection powerfully contributes to reducing poverty, exclusion and inequality – while enhancing political stability and social cohesion. It also
contributes to economic growth by supporting household income and thus domestic consumption; this is
particularly important during this time of slow recovery and low global demand. Further, social protection enhances human capital and productivity, so
it has become a critical policy for transformative national development. Social protection, specifically social
protection floors, are essential for recovery, inclusive
development and social justice, and must be part of the
post-2015 development agenda.

1.1 A right unfulfilled

2

While the need for social protection is widely recognized, the fundamental human right to social security remains unfulfilled for the large majority of the
world’s population.1 Despite the impressive extension
of social protection coverage over the past century, especially over the past decade, only a minority of the
world’s population is effectively protected. According
to ILO estimates, in 2012 only 27 per cent of the working-age population and their families across the globe
had access to comprehensive social security systems. In
other words, almost three-quarters, or 73 per cent, of
the world’s population, about 5.2 billion people, do not
enjoy access to comprehensive social protection. Many
of those not sufficiently protected live in poverty, which
is the case for half the population of middle- and lowincome countries (World Bank, 2014).2 Many of them,
about 800  million people, are working poor (ILO,
2014a), and many work in the informal economy.3
The lack of access to social protection constitutes
a major obstacle to economic and social development
(ILO, 2010a; ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2012a; UN, 2008; UN,
2012b). In fact, the widespread lack of social protection
coverage is associated with high and persistent levels of
poverty and economic insecurity in some parts of the
world (e.g. World Bank, 2014), high and growing levels
of inequality (UNDP, 2014; UN, 2013d; UNRISD,
2010), insufficient investments in human capital and
human capabilities, and weak automatic stabilizers
of aggregate demand in the event of economic shocks
(e.g. ADB, 2014).
Social protection policies contribute to fostering both
economic and social development in the short and the
long term, by ensuring that people enjoy income security,

have effective access to health care and other social services, and are empowered to take advantage of economic
opportunities. They play a key role in boosting domestic
demand, supporting structural transformation of national economies, promoting decent work, and fostering
inclusive and sustainable growth (e.g. G20, 2011; G20,
2012; ILO, 2012a; OECD, 2009a; World Bank, 2012).
Social protection policies also accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (UN, 2010a;
UNICEF, 2010). Sustainable and equitable  growth
cannot be achieved in the absence of strong social protection policies which guarantee at least a basic level of
social protection to all in need and progressively extend
the scope and level of social security coverage.4 Such basic
levels of social security should be guaranteed as part of
national social protection floors, which constitute the
fundamental elements of national social security systems.
Many countries have significantly extended their
social security coverage during recent years and have
stepped up their efforts to ensure that all in need
benefit from at least basic protection, while continuing
to develop their social security systems. In Brazil, Cabo
Verde, China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Mozambique,
South Africa and Thailand, for example, the gradual
extension of social security coverage has had a significant impact on the well-being of the population, and
has contributed, in conjunction with economic, labour
market and employment policies, to fostering economic
and social development and inclusive growth.
On the other hand, in the aftermath of the global
financial and economic crisis a number of governments have reduced public spending in areas including
social security systems, resulting in limits on the coverage or level of benefits. Fiscal consolidation5 measures have slowed progress towards the realization of the

1  There are varying definitions of the terms “social protection” and “social security”. In many contexts, as in this report, the two terms are
used interchangeably. The ILO usually uses the term “social security”, with reference to the human right to social security set out in the
Universal Declaration on Human Rights, 1948 (Art. 22), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966
(Art. 9) and other UN human rights instruments. This term encompasses a broad variety of policy instruments, including social insurance,
social assistance, universal benefits and other forms of cash transfers, as well as measures to ensure effective access to health care and other
benefits in kind aiming at securing social protection. For more detail, see the glossary at the end of this report (Annex I), as well as ILO,
2010a, pp. 13–17.

3  The informal economy is understood as the set of all economic activities by workers and economic units that are – in law or in
practice – not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements. Workers in the informal economy are usually covered insufficiently
or not at all by social protection; indeed, the lack of social protection coverage is sometimes used as a criterion by which to identify informal
employment. At the same time, extending social protection coverage to workers in the informal economy helps to address some of the risks
that trap workers in informality (such as the lack of health coverage) and support transitions to formalization (ILO, 2013g; ILO, 2013h).
4  This recognition reflects an important policy paradigm shift in international development (Cichon and Hagemejer, 2007; Cichon, 2013).
This can be seen in policy documents and academic studies, but also in the wide range of recent policy reforms in a growing number of
developing countries.

accumulation. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

Since the beginning of the twentieth century, significant progress has been made in extending social
security coverage and building comprehensive social
security systems. From early steps taken in a number of
pioneer countries, the scope of legal coverage,6 as measured by the number of areas covered by social protection programmes anchored in national legislation, was
extended at an impressive pace to more countries and
more areas (see figure 1.1).7 By 2012, the majority of
countries had social security schemes established by
law covering all or most areas, albeit in many cases only
for a minority of their populations. This was the case
in most European countries, large parts of the Americas, and increasingly also in Asia and the Pacific and in
North Africa. Significant progress has also been made
in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.
Countries tend to extend their national social security systems in a sequence of steps, depending on

their national circumstances and priorities. In many
cases, when building social security systems, countries
first addressed the area of employment injury, then introduced old-age pensions, disability and survivors’
benefits, followed by sickness, health and maternity
coverage. Benefits for children and families, and unemployment benefits, typically came last (see figure 1.2).
However, the extension of legal coverage does not in
itself ensure either the effective coverage of the population or improvements in the quality and level of benefits. In fact, the extension of effective coverage has
significantly lagged behind that of legal coverage, due
to problems in implementation and enforcement, a lack
of policy coordination and weak institutional capacities
for the effective delivery of benefits and services. It is
therefore essential to monitor legal and effective coverage in parallel, as will be done throughout this report,
as far as the available data allow.
In many countries, a number of programmes have
emerged in recent years that provide some degree of
protection but lack a legal foundation. These cannot be
considered as offering the same quantity and extent of
protection as programmes grounded in law, as they do
not establish legal entitlements or enforceable rights.
Still, they play an important role in improving the situation of those benefiting from them. Many governments recognize the importance of anchoring social

security programmes in a sound framework of national
legislation, thereby clarifying individuals’ rights and
obligations, enhancing the predictability and adequacy
of benefits, strengthening institutional capacities promoting transparency and accountability, providing
safeguards against corruption and establishing a more
stable and regular funding base.

1.3 Fiscal consolidation:
Setbacks 2010–15
The report also focuses on the setbacks resulting from
fiscal adjustment processes initiated from 2010 onwards. In 2014, 122 countries are limiting their public
expenditures in terms of GDP, at a time when populations are most in need. Fiscal consolidation measures
have contributed to increases in poverty and social exclusion in several high-income countries, adding to
the effects of persistent unemployment, lower wages
and higher taxes. The resulting depressed household
income levels are jeopardizing domestic consumption
and demand, and slowing down recovery.
Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolidation
policies have been applied not only in European countries, but also in some middle- and low-income countries,
which are currently grappling with dwindling economic
growth rates (IMF, 2013a). The combination of food
and fuel price increases, followed by the global economic
slowdown, jobless recovery and now cutbacks in public
expenditure, have taken a toll on families in developing
countries. The crucial importance of governments’ commitment to continuing investments in social protection,
in order to ensure inclusive growth and limit the harmful effects of persistent poverty and growing inequality,
is highlighted in the different chapters of the report.

1.4 The way forward: Building
national social protection floors
and social security systems
With the adoption of the ILO’s Social Protection
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), the world
has taken a significant step forward in the realization

of the human right to social security.8 This Recommendation is the first international legal instrument that
explicitly recognizes the triple role of social security as
a universal human right and an economic and social necessity. It recognizes the importance of national social
protection floors, which provide basic social security
guarantees to all with the aim of ensuring effective
access to at least essential health care and a basic level of
income security as a matter of priority, as the indispensable foundation for more comprehensive national social
security systems (ILO, 2012a). The ILO’s two-dimensional extension strategy provides clear guidance on the
future development of social security in the ILO’s 185
member States towards the achievement of universal
protection of the population by ensuring at least basic
levels of income security and access to essential health
care (national social protection floors: horizontal dimension) and progressively ensuring wider scope and
higher levels of protection, guided by ILO social security standards (vertical dimension).9
The importance of building national social protection floors has also been recognized by the United
Nations and the wider international development community. Following the call for the establishment of
social protection floors by the UN Chief Executives
Board in 2009 (UN, 2009a; Social Protection Floor
Advisory Group, 2011), the role of social protection in
general, and social protection floors in particular, for
economic and social development has been acknowledged in a number of international, regional and multinational forums, including the United Nations (e.g.
UN, 2010b; UN, 2012a) and the G20 (G20, 2009;
G20, 2011; G20, 2012).
The emerging global consensus on social protection
floors has been accompanied by a stronger emphasis
on coherent and effective social protection systems in
the strategic frameworks of other major international
and multilateral organizations (FAO, 2012; OECD,
2009a; UNICEF, 2012; WHO, 2010; World Bank,
2012; European Commission, 2011a; European Commission, 2012a). Along with the ILO, they emphasize
the need for a systemic approach to social protection,
aiming at building inclusive and sustainable social protection systems that are closely coordinated with other
social and economic policies. Together with other

8  Recommendation No. 202 was adopted almost unanimously (one abstention) by governments and employers’ and workers’ representatives
of the ILO’s member States at the 101st Session of the International Labour Conference. The core elements of this Recommendation,
and wider perspectives, were reflected in the Resolution and conclusions concerning the recurrent discussion on social protection (social
security), adopted at the previous session of the International Labour Conference in 2011. Both documents are included in ILO, 2012a.

Box 1.1  The ILO’s normative framework for the extension of social security

6

Since its establishment in 1919, the ILO has played a major role developing an internationally defined
normative framework guiding the establishment, development and maintenance of social security systems
across the world, and has become the world’s leading point of reference for efforts to this end. Elaborated
and adopted by the Organization’s tripartite constituents, governments, employers’ and workers’ representatives of all ILO member States, and stemming from the Organization’s mandate, the Conventions and
Recommendations that compose this framework are unique: they establish standards that States set for
themselves, building on good practices and innovative ways of providing enhanced and extended social
protection in countries from all regions of the world. At the same time, they are built on the notion that
there is no single perfect model for social security; on the contrary, it is for each society to develop the best
means of guaranteeing the protection required. Accordingly, they offer a range of options and flexible routes
for their application, which can be achieved through a combination of contributory and non-contributory
benefits, general and occupational schemes, compulsory and voluntary insurance, and different methods
for the administration of benefits, all directed at ensuring an overall level of protection which best responds
to each country’s needs.
Complementing and giving specific form to the provisions regarding the right to social security in international human rights instruments, the ILO’s normative social security framework consists of eight upto-date Conventions and Recommendations. The most prominent instruments are the Social Security
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), and the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012
(No. 202).1
The long-standing Convention No. 102 regroups the nine classical social security contingencies (medical
care, sickness, unemployment, old age, employment injury, family responsibilities, maternity, invalidity,
survivorship) into a single comprehensive and legally binding instrument.
The recent Recommendation No. 202 provides guidance on closing social security gaps and achieving
universal coverage through the establishment and maintenance of comprehensive social security systems.
It calls upon States to achieve universal coverage with at least minimum levels of protection through the
implementation of social protection floors as a matter of priority; and to progressively ensure higher levels
of protection. National social protection floors should comprise basic social security guarantees that ensure
effective access to essential health care and basic income security at a level that allows people to live in
dignity throughout the life cycle These should include at least:
•	 access to essential health care, including maternity care;
•	 basic income security for children;
•	 basic income security for persons of working age who are unable to earn sufficient income, in particular
in cases of sickness, unemployment, maternity and disability;
•	 basic income security for older persons.
Complementing existing standards, Recommendation No. 202 sets forth an integrated and coherent approach to social protection across the life cycle, underscores the principle of universality of protection
through nationally defined social protection floors, and embodies a commitment to their progressive realization in terms of benefits and people covered. It thereby aims at ensuring that all members of society
enjoy at least a basic level of social security throughout their lives, ensuring their health and dignity. Poverty,
vulnerability and social exclusion are established as priority areas of attention, with the clear objective of reducing poverty as soon as possible. The Recommendation calls for systems that are country-led, are aligned
to national circumstances, are reviewed in the light of population needs, and include the participation of all
stakeholders. In an innovative way, it contains guidance on monitoring to help countries assess their progress
in moving towards enhanced protection and improve the performance of national social security systems.

  Convention No. 102 has been ratified to date by 50 countries, most recently by Brazil (2009), Bulgaria (2008), Honduras
(2012), Jordan (2014), Romania (2009) and Uruguay (2010), and provides guidance for all 185 ILO member States. ILO

security systems to provide populations with meaningful social protection.

1.5 Objective and structure of the report
Two years after the adoption of Recommendation
No. 202, this report takes stock of the state of social
security coverage around the world, particularly with
regard to the building of national social protection
floors and comprehensive social security systems. This
report is the second in a series of reports10 that provide an assessment of social security coverage around
the world, highlight progress made in enhancing protection, identify remaining coverage gaps, and discuss
major challenges for further progress in realizing the
right to social security for all.
Reflecting the approach set out in Recommendation No. 202, this report is structured in a sequence
of chapters following the life cycle, so that relevant
clusters of contributory or non-contributory social
security schemes and programmes are addressed together.11 Chapters 2–4 focus on social protection benefits that enhance income security throughout the life
cycle, gathered into three major clusters: Chapter 2
focuses on social protection benefits for children and
families, including child and family benefits; Chapter 3 addresses various elements of income security for
people of working age, addressing specifically benefits
in case of unemployment (section 3.2), employment
injury (section 3.3), disability (section 3.4) and maternity (section 3.5). Chapter 4 addresses income security in old age, with a particular focus on old-age
pensions.12 Chapter 5 is devoted to achieving universal
coverage in health throughout the life cycle, including
medical care and sickness benefits. Chapter 6 is devoted
to issues of social security financing and expenditure,

and reflects specifically on the divergent trends of expansion and contraction, and their implications for
future policy-making in social security and the post2015 development agenda. Throughout the report, reference is repeatedly made to the rights underpinning
social security systems, which remain as valid and as
important as ever.
Annex I includes a short glossary of key terms used
in this report, and Annex II summarizes the concepts
and measurement of social security coverage applied.
Annex III includes summary tables regarding some of
the main minimum requirements set out in ILO social
security standards. Annex IV includes the statistical
tables.

1.6 Building the knowledge base
on social protection statistics
Conceived as a tool to facilitate monitoring of the state
of social protection in the world, the World Social Protection Report offers in its successive editions an extensive statistical resource in relation to social protection,
including a set of detailed tables in the Statistical
Annex (Annex IV) of this report, and more on a dedicated website.13 This database draws to a large extent
on the ILO Social Security Inquiry database, which
provides in-depth country-level statistics on various
dimensions of social security systems, including key
indicators.14
Having published such data since the 1950s in
various forms, the ILO maintains its databases in collaboration, as far as possible on a consistent basis, with
a number of other international and regional actors,
notably the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat),
the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECLAC) and other regional commissions
of the United Nations, the International Social Security
Association (ISSA), the Organisation for Economic

10  The first report in the series was published as the World Social Security Report in 2010 (ILO, 2010a). This report is published as the
World Social Protection Report in order to reflect the greater interest in social protection issues in many parts of the world, and at the
international level.
11  In doing so, both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the extension of social security (ILO, 2012a) are addressed in an integrated
way in each chapter.
12  General social assistance is not treated under a separate heading but is referred to throughout the report.
13  The Statistical Annex (Annex IV) of this report includes two sets of tables. Tables AIV.A1–AIV.A12 provide key demographic,
economic and social indicators and are available online; tables AIV.B1–AIV.B13, which are more specifically concerned with social
protection, are included also in the printed version. All material is available at http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/ShowTheme.

The ILO Social Security Inquiry database is linked to
various other databases on social protection, including the Eurostat European System of Integrated Social
Protection Statistics database (ESPROSS), the OECD
Social Expenditure database (SOCX), the World Bank
pensions and ASPIRE databases, the ISSA’s Social Security Observatory, the ADB Social Protection Index
database (SPI), the WHO’s Global Health Observatory
and National Health Accounts, and ECLAC’s databases.15 The ILO Social Security Inquiry database also
draws on national official reports and other sources,

which usually are largely based on administrative data;
and on survey data from a range of sources including
national household income and expenditure surveys,
labour force surveys, and demographic and health surveys, to the extent that these include variables on social
protection. This report is also intended as a contribution to the joint efforts at national and international
level16 to ensure the availability of high-quality social
security statistics, not least to support ILO member
States in monitoring and reviewing their social protection floors and social security systems, and to ensure
their effectiveness and efficiency in meeting the social
protection needs of their populations.

collaboration between international agencies in the field of social protection statistics and to develop integrated guidance material for
national actors (ILO et al., 2013; Bonnet and Tessier, 2013). This work aims at carrying further the international community’s earlier efforts
to agree on a set of core indicators in the field of social security statistics, as set out in the “Resolution concerning the development of social
security statistics”, adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 1957, which continues to provide relevant guidance
for the further development of social security statistics at the national level.

KEY MESSAGES
nn Social protection policies are an essential element of realizing children’s rights, ensuring their well-being, breaking the vicious cycle
of poverty and vulnerability, and helping all children realize their
full potential.
nn Despite a large expansion of schemes, existing social protection
policies do not sufficiently address the income security needs of
children and families, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with large child populations. About 18,000 children die every
day, mainly from preventable causes. Many of these deaths could
be prevented through adequate social protection.
nn More efforts are needed to step up measures to ensure income security for children and families, including child and family benefits.
Specific child and family benefit programmes rooted in legislation
exist in 108 countries, yet often cover only small groups of the population. In 75 countries, no such programmes are available at all.
nn On average, governments allocate 0.4 per cent of GDP to child and
family benefits, ranging from 2.2  per cent in Western Europe to
0.2 per cent in Africa, and in Asia and the Pacific. Underinvestment in children jeopardizes their rights and their future, as well as
the economic and social development prospects of the countries in
which they live.
nn Fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures in higher-income
economies threaten progress on income security for children and
their families. Child poverty increased in 19 of the 28 countries of
the European Union between 2007 and 2012.
nn Social protection is a human right, further supported by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, and yet many children do
not receive the essential cash transfers that could make a real difference, in terms of nutrition, health, education and care services,
to their chances of realizing their full potential. Social protection also
has a key – yet often neglected – role in preventing child labour.

2.1 The role of social protection in ensuring
children’s well-being

10

Social protection is essential in preventing and reducing poverty for children and families, in addressing inequalities and in realizing children’s rights.
Despite recent progress in many parts of the world,
too many children live in poverty and are deprived
of their most elementary rights (UNICEF, 2012;
UNICEF, 2014). In, fact, in most parts of the world,
children and families with children are at greater risk
of poverty than other groups of the population, with
respect to both monetary and other forms of poverty.
The consequences of poverty are very significant
for children. Children experience poverty differently
from adults; they have specific and different needs.
While an adult may fall into poverty temporarily, a
child who falls into poverty may be poor for a lifetime – rarely does a child get a second chance at an
education or a healthy start in life. Even short periods
of food deprivation can be detrimental to children’s
long-term development. If children do not receive adequate nutrition, they lag behind their peers in size
and intellectual capacity, are more vulnerable to lifethreatening diseases, perform less well in school, and
ultimately are less likely to be productive adults. Child
poverty threatens not only the individual child, but is
likely to be passed on to future generations, entrenching and even exacerbating inequality in society (see,
e.g. UNICEF, 2012; UNICEF, 2014; Minujin and
Nandy, 2012; Ortiz, Moreira Daniels and Engilbertsdóttir, 2012). Many of the 18,000 children under the
age of five who die every day, mainly from prevent­
able causes, could be saved through adequate social
protection (UNICEF, 2014). Where children are
­deprived of a decent standard of living, access to quality health care (see Chapter 5), education and care, and
where they suffer from social exclusion, their future is
compromised. Where children are forced to engage in
child labour, such exploitation takes a heavy toll on
their physical and cognitive development, and on their
future life chances (ILO, 2013a). Child poverty affects
not only the well-being and aspirations of individual
children, but also the wider communities, societies and
economies in which they live.
Child and family benefits, in cash and in kind, play
a particularly important role in realizing children’s
rights and addressing their needs, particularly for the
most vulnerable members of society (see, e.g. UNICEF,
2012; Sanfilippo, de Neubourg and Martorano, 2012;
UNESCO, 2014). Evidence from many parts of the

world demonstrates that social protection benefits have
led to a marked improvement in the nutritional status
of children (see ILO, 2010a; UNICEF, 2012; Save the
Children, 2012a). Cash transfer programmes have also
contributed to a significant increase in the utilization
of pre- and post-natal health visits and in a reduction in
the proportion of home-based births, thus enhancing
maternal and child health. More generally, such programmes have been shown to increase the utilization
of health services, again contributing to improvements
in children’s health (e.g. Attanasio et al., 2005). Cash
transfers for children and families, both conditional and
non-conditional, have also contributed to significant increases in children’s enrolment and attendance at school
in different parts of the world, as well as, although with
less conclusive evidence, improvements in education
outcomes (e.g. additional years of schooling, impact on
wages) (Fiszbein and Schady, 2009; Baird et al., 2013;
UNICEF, 2012; ILO, 2010b; ILO, 2013a). Through
these various channels, social protection benefits contribute to enhancing children’s current and future wellbeing, and their ability to seize economic and social
opportunities in later life. Child and family benefits, together with other forms of benefits and services, are also
an important means of responding to the special needs
of children with disabilities (UNICEF, 2013), orphans
and vulnerable children, children affected by violence
and abuse, and other disadvantaged children (Save the
Children, 2012b; Barrientos et al., 2013).
This chapter focuses in particular on the income security of children and families, which constitutes a key
dimension of their well-being. Strengthening income
security is therefore a key element of policies that aim
at reducing and preventing child poverty, at breaking
the intergenerational transmission of poverty, and at
facilitating children’s access to nutrition, care, education and health care. The ILO’s Social Protection
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), explicitly
recognizes income security for children as one of the
basic social security guarantees constituting a national
social protection floor, based on an integrated approach
that addresses the multiple dimensions of child well-­
being. This basic social security guarantee provides an
effective framework for national policies (see box 2.1).
The notion of income security is not limited to a sufficient level of cash income, but encompasses income in
kind, such as nutrition and access to services – indeed,
the broad range of resources that is necessary to secure
a decent standard of living and life in dignity for all
children. Social services (e.g. care, education, health
care) are essential in ensuring income security, as these

2. Social protection for children and families

Box 2.1  International standards for child and family benefits
The UN legal framework on human rights contains a number of provisions spelling out various rights of children that form part of their right to social protection. These comprise the right to social security, taking into
consideration the resources and the circumstances of the child and persons having responsibility for their
maintenance;1 the right to a standard of living adequate for their health and their well-being; and the right to
special care and assistance.2 The ICESCR further requires States to give the widest possible protection and
assistance to the family, particularly for the care and education of dependent children.3
ILO social security standards complement this framework and provide guidance to countries on how to
give effect to the various rights that form part of the right of children to social protection. The ILO Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), Part VII, sets minimum standards for the provision
of family (or child) benefits in the form of either a periodic cash benefit or benefits in kind (food, clothing,
housing, holidays or domestic help) or a combination of both, allocated for the maintenance of children. The
fundamental objective of family benefits should thus be to ensure the welfare of children and the economic
stability of their families.
As specified by the ILO’s Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, these standards require that family benefits be granted in respect of each child in the family and to
all children, for so long as the child is receiving education or vocational training on a full-time basis and is
not in receipt of an adequate income determined by national legislation. They should be set at a level which
relates directly to the actual cost of providing for a child and should represent a substantial contribution to
this cost. Family allowances at the minimum rate should be granted regardless of means. Benefits above
the minimum rate may be subject to a means test. Furthermore, all benefits should be adjusted in order to
take into account changes in the cost of providing for children or in the general cost of living (ILO, 2011c,
paras 184–86).
ILO Recommendation No. 202 further refines and extends the normative framework, aiming at universal
protection. Income security for children is one of the basic social security guarantees constituting a national
social protection floor, and should ensure “access to nutrition, education, care and any other necessary
goods and services” (para. 5(b)). Although the guarantee should be nationally defined, the Recommendation provides clear guidance on its appropriate level: the minimum level of income security should allow for
life in dignity and should be sufficient to provide for effective access to a set of necessary goods and services, such as may be set out through national poverty lines and other comparable thresholds (para. 8(b)).
Providing for universality of protection, the Recommendation sets out that the basic social security guarantee should apply to at least all residents, and all children, as defined in national laws and regulations and
subject to existing international obligations (para. 6), that is, to the respective provisions of the CRC, the
ICESCR and other relevant instruments. Representing an approach strongly focused on outcomes, Recommendation No. 202 allows for a broad range of policy instruments to achieve income security for children,
including child and family benefits (the focus of this chapter).

reduce families’ spending needs and can facilitate parents’ availability to engage in paid employment knowing that their children are well cared for (e.g. UNICEF
and ILO, 2013). Measures to facilitate access to health,
education and care services, combined with measures to
improve the availability and quality of those services,
are necessary to ensure that children may realize their
full potential.
Obviously, income security for children is impossible to achieve in isolation from the family and
household context. Income security for children therefore mirrors the income security of their parents,

grandparents and/or other carers. As a result, the range
of policies and policy instruments available to achieve
this goal is very broad, and reaches well beyond child
and family benefits in a narrow sense: it also includes
other social protection programmes as part of the national social security system, as well as broader policies that address decent and productive employment,
wages and incomes, access to health care, education and
other social services, as well as gender equality and care
arrangements.1
The broad range of policies that are necessary to
achieve income security for children is reflected in the

Box 2.2  Child-sensitive social protection
The Joint Statement on Advancing Child-sensitive Social Protection sets out that the design, implementation
and evaluation of child-sensitive social protection programmes should aim to:
•	 avoid adverse impacts on children, and reduce or mitigate social and economic risks that directly affect
children’s lives;
•	 intervene as early as possible where children are at risk, in order to prevent irreversible impairment or
harm;
•	 consider the age and gender-specific risks and vulnerabilities of children throughout the life cycle;
•	 mitigate the effects of shocks, exclusion and poverty on families, recognizing that families raising children
need support to ensure equal opportunity;
•	 make special provision to reach children who are particularly vulnerable and excluded, including children
without parental care, and those who are marginalized within their families or communities due to their
gender, disability, ethnicity, HIV and AIDS, or other factors;
•	 consider the mechanisms and intra-household dynamics that may affect how children are reached,
paying particular attention to the balance of power between men and women within the household and
broader community;
•	 include the voices and opinions of children, their care-givers and youth in the understanding and design
of social protection systems and programmes.

The joint statement (DfID et al., 2009) was issued by the DfID, ­HelpAge International, Hope & Homes for
Children, Institute of Development Studies, ILO, Overseas Development Institute, Save the Children UK,
UNDP, UNICEF and the World Bank.

Joint Statement on Advancing Child-sensitive Social
Protection issued in 2009 by a coalition of agencies,
bilateral donor agencies and international NGOs (see
box 2.2). This statement sets out important guidelines for the design, implementation and monitoring
of social security schemes and programmes in order
to ensure that the needs of children are addressed in a
broad range of policies, including in national social protection systems and particularly national social protection floors.
The need for a broad social protection approach
to realizing children’s rights is also reflected in the
recent World Report on Child Labour (ILO, 2013a;
see box 2.3), which has highlighted the need to take a
comprehensive and systemic view, considering the full
range of social protection instruments, including those
which ensure income security for working-age adults
(e.g. unemployment protection, maternity benefits,
disability benefits) and older persons (e.g. old-age pensions). Social health protection occupies a key role in
protecting households from health-related poverty risks
which are closely associated with the incidence of child
labour. Child-sensitive measures aimed at reducing and
preventing child labour should therefore form part of

an approach that sets out not only to strengthen national social security systems but also to ensure effective
coordination with other related policy areas, including
employment, wages and broader social policies.

2.2 Expenditure on social protection
for children and families
Public expenditure on social protection benefits aimed
specifically at meeting the needs of children amounts
to 0.4 per cent of total GDP worldwide, or 7.4 per cent
of total social protection expenditure (excluding health
expenditure) (see figures 2.1 and 2.2). These figures include child benefits and benefits targeting families with
children, such as cash transfer programmes for children
and families,2 whether provided in cash or in kind, but
exclude provisions for health and education,3 two important related policy areas.
There is wide variation across regions. Whereas
countries in Western Europe spend on average 2.2 per
cent of their GDP on child and family benefits, representing about one-tenth of their public social protection expenditure (excluding health expenditure), in all

2  General social assistance and other benefits which may indirectly benefit children (e.g. maternity benefits) are not included.
3  The figures do, however, take into account some provisions designed to facilitate children’s participation in education, such as textbooks,
uniforms and school meals, where these are provided as part of social protection programmes.

2. Social protection for children and families

Box 2.3  Social security systems and the prevention of child labour
Social protection is highly relevant to the prevention and reduction of child labour. Economic vulnerabilities
associated with poverty and shocks are important drivers of child labour. Social protection instruments
can play an important role in reducing child labour by mitigating these vulnerabilities and enhancing poor
families’ resilience. These links are explored in detail in the World Report on Child Labour (ILO, 2013a).
The links between social protection and child labour have received more attention with the emergence of
conditional cash transfer programmes that explicitly link the receipt of cash benefits to school attendance
or similar conditions. Many programmes have been found to have a significant effect in promoting school
enrolment and attendance, yet it is not fully clear whether these effects result directly from the behavioural
conditions, or indirectly through the income effect and a stronger emphasis on supply-side factors, that is,
in ensuring that schools are actually available and accessible for poor children (ILO, 2013a; Barrientos et al.,
2013). From the few evaluations that have systematically assessed the impact on children’s work, it can be
deduced that, while cash benefits tend to have a strong impact on school attendance, they may not reduce
child labour to the same extent: many children combine school and work. Reductions in child labour are
more evident where cash benefits are integrated with additional programme elements, such as after-school
programmes, as in Brazil.1
Economic vulnerability is not the only cause of child labour, and social protection is not by itself a complete answer to it. Nonetheless, social protection is a critical pillar of a broader policy response to child
labour. Efforts against child labour are unlikely to be successful in the absence of a social protection floor
to safeguard vulnerable households and to enable them to seize opportunities and to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
Although other elements of social security systems have not been systematically assessed with regard
to their impact on child labour, it can be assumed that they also have a positive effect in so far as they
reduce the vulnerability of poor households and address poverty risks that may otherwise promote child
labour. This is, for example, the case for social health protection, reflecting the fact that ill health constitutes a major poverty risk for vulnerable households. Measures to reduce the income insecurity of adults,
including unemployment protection, employment guarantee schemes, disability benefits, maternity benefits
and social pensions, also contribute to mitigating vulnerability for poor households, and can contribute to
preventing and reducing child labour.
Within any broader social security system, building a national social protection floor is particularly relevant
to addressing vulnerabilities associated with child labour. Social protection floors provide a set of basic
social security guarantees, including a basic level of income security throughout the life cycle and access
to essential health care. These basic guarantees, in turn, are essential in addressing the multifaceted economic and social vulnerabilities which promote and sustain child labour. Where children and their families
enjoy basic income security and access to essential health care, and where the necessary education and
other services are in place, child labour can be effectively prevented. Indeed, evidence presented in this
report suggests that an approach linking cash and in-kind benefits with access to education and health

other regions, less than 1 per cent of GDP is allocated
to child and family benefits, even though in most of
them children form a significantly higher proportion
of the total population than in Europe. Despite the
recent extension of cash transfer programmes, public
expenditure on child benefits in Latin America and the
Caribbean reaches only 0.7 per cent of GDP, or 6.5 per
cent of public social protection expenditure (excluding health expenditure), a level similar to that prevailing in North America, the Middle East, and Central
and Eastern Europe. In Asia and the Pacific, and in
Africa, on average 0.2 per cent of GDP is allocated to
child and family benefits. In the case of Africa, in particular, the low proportion of public expenditure on

child and family benefits is particularly striking, considering the high proportion of children in the total
population (children under 15 make up 42 per cent of
Africa’s population).
It is clear that the level of resources allocated is not
sufficient to respond adequately to the income security
needs of children and families, even when taking into
account that these needs are also addressed through
other means, including public health, education and
care services. Underinvestment in the social protection
needs of children is particularly critical in low-income
countries, which on average allocate less than 0.1 per
cent of their GDP to child and family benefits. This
points to a significant underinvestment in children,

which is likely to have negative effects on the future
productivity of these countries’ workforce, and their
future economic and social development prospects.
The overall level of resources allocated to children
and families depends, among other factors, on the
composition of the set of benefits and services available. These reach beyond social protection in a narrow
sense, and are only partly included in measures of social
protection expenditure. While in some countries cash
benefits play a major role in the overall package of benefits and services available to families, in others the provision of benefits in kind (e.g. school meals and other
nutrition interventions, affordable housing) or the provision of services (e.g. childcare) plays a more dominant
role, and obviously also affects the income security of
families with children. The provision of quality public
education, childcare and health services (see Chapter 5)
also has implications for ensuring income security
for families with children by reducing their need to
allocate scarce resources to school fees and the costs
of health and other care; yet these services also suffer
from considerable underinvestment in some parts of the
world. The availability of childcare services, along with
the presence of public policies and measures adopted by

employers to facilitate sharing work and family responsibilities for parents with children, will also affect the
income security of children.

2.3 Extent of legal coverage:
Child and family benefit programmes
anchored in national legislation
Taking account of the wide range of social protection
benefits and services needed to ensure children’s wellbeing and the realization of their rights, this chapter ­focuses in particular on child and family benefits
aiming at enhancing income security, and considers
them in relation to the social security benefits discussed
in other chapters of this report.4
Child and family benefits include various types
of social protection benefits or combinations thereof
(see figure  2.3). Some countries provide universal
child benefits that cover all children, independently
of the employment or income status of their parents,
and are usually financed out of general taxation. Benefits are usually flat, but benefit rates may be differentiated by the age of the child or by taking into account

4  In this respect, it is also useful to consider the labour market and employment implications of child and family benefits. These can
also influence labour markets and wage-setting, and in terms of policy-making this may be seen as an important function in its own
right. If the costs of bringing up children are at least partially met through collectively financed benefits (from general taxation or social
insurance contributions), the differential needs of workers with children, as compared to workers without children, will not have to be met
(exclusively) through wages. This may be seen as providing a more “level playing field” between workers with and without family obligations,
and thus minimizing one possible source of distortion in the general wage structure. This outcome is seen in many high-income countries,
where child benefits are available on an equal basis for all children, usually without means testing.

the total number of children in the family. In some
countries, benefits are fully or partially organized
through the tax system, by providing tax rebates or a
negative income tax to families with children.5 Employment-related child or family benefits, usually financed through contributions and organized through
social insurance schemes, cover mostly employees in
the formal economy. Means-tested child and family
benefits (specific social assistance benefits for children
and families) are usually targeted towards poor families
and children. They include a wide range of cash transfer programmes for children and families introduced
in recent years, including conditional and non-conditional benefits.6 These programmes have had a major
impact on extending coverage and providing at least
a minimum level of income security to children and
families. Figure 2.3 summarizes the different types of

programmes, and combinations thereof, through which
cash benefits for children and families are provided.
It focuses on programmes anchored in national legislation, as these are usually more stable in terms of funding and institutional frameworks, guarantee coverage as
a matter of right, and provide legal entitlements to eligible individuals and households. In addition to these
programmes, in some countries other programmes exist
which are not yet anchored in national legislation, including pilot or temporary programmes, often limited
to certain regions or districts.
In 108 countries out of the 183 for which sufficient
data are available, periodic child or family benefits in
cash are provided to eligible families and/or children.
Many of the remaining 75 countries do, however, have
more general social assistance programmes, which may
provide benefits contributing to income security for

5  In fact, the tax system plays a strong – and often neglected – role in redistributive policies for children and families (e.g. Adema, Fron and
Ladaique, 2014).
6  Some of these programmes include benefits for categories of the population other than children, and would therefore, strictly speaking,
be classified as general social assistance programmes rather than child and family benefits. Indeed, some tend to be perceived as focusing
exclusively on children and families, although in fact they have a broader remit.

children and families, in the absence of specific child or
family benefits. In addition to these cash benefits, many
countries provide benefits in kind of various types, including access to free or subsidized goods (e.g. school
meals).
Figure 2.4 illustrates the global distribution of child
or family benefit programmes anchored in legislation.
Some countries, particularly in Western Europe, provide such benefits to all children on a universal basis,
financed out of general taxation, sometimes supplemented by specific social assistance benefits. Other
countries, particularly in Africa and Latin America,
have traditionally provided family allowances as part
of their social insurance system or rely on a system of
employer liability, requiring employers to pay family
benefits to their workers. Where the provision of child
benefits is directly or indirectly linked to an employment relationship, coverage rates tend to be lower than
for universal provision, especially in countries with a
large informal economy. In some of these countries,

however, means-tested benefits complement employment-related family benefits and provide an important
support for workers in the informal economy. In another group of countries, means-tested benefits constitute the dominant form of provision, either focusing
on a relatively small group of vulnerable children and
families, or providing a much wider coverage.7
While many countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean combine employment-related benefits with
non-contributory benefits anchored in legislation,
thereby covering a substantial proportion of children and families, this is not the case in large parts of
Africa and of Asia and the Pacific. Here, non-contributory programmes are not yet well enough developed
to cover substantial numbers of children and families;
many programmes still remain at a “pilot” stage with
limited geographical coverage. More efforts are needed
to anchor programmes in legislation in order to establish a clear definition of eligibility criteria and benefits,
and a more stable basis for the implementation of these

7  While most of these countries target child and family benefits to the poor in the form of specific social assistance benefits for families with
children, there is a small group of countries which use a relatively light income or asset test to exclude affluent population groups from the
provision of child benefits but maintain provision for the broad majority of the population (e.g. Cyprus, following a recent reform).

programmes, especially with regard to financial sustainability and institutional capacities.
An important aspect of the observed trends around
the world is the extent to which countries are able to
make provision for all residents, or at least those in
need. Figure 2.5 shows that the achievement of this
objective is linked to different priorities and traditions,

and to some extent also to economic capacities available in the different parts of the world. While universal
provision of child benefits is prevalent particularly in
Europe and North America, in other parts of the world
coverage tends to be more limited, usually to children
of those employed in the formal economy and/or those
in poor families.

2. Social protection for children and families

As with other areas of social security, the level of
legal coverage of cash child and family benefits is correlated with the mode of provision and financing (see
figure 2.6). Where child benefits are financed mainly
through employers, particularly in countries where informality of employment prevails, coverage levels tend
to be rather low. High levels of coverage usually require
that the government take responsibility for financing
the benefits by complementing coverage through existing contributory programmes for those groups of
the population not or not sufficiently covered, whether
through the provision of non-contributory benefits (as
e.g. in Argentina or France) or through a large-scale noncontributory universal programme (as e.g. in Canada,
Germany or Mongolia), in either case financed from
either general taxation or other government revenue.

2.4 Closing coverage gaps and strengthening
income security for children and families
Closing gaps in the coverage of child and family benefits is essential for ensuring income security for children
and families. While universal or near-universal coverage
is a reality in many OECD countries, and in many lowand middle-income countries the introduction of new
child and family benefit programmes and the reform of
existing ones have improved coverage to some extent,
large gaps nevertheless remain.
The most prominent new development is the emergence of non-contributory cash transfer programmes
in many low- and middle-income countries.8 These programmes provide regular cash benefits to all families, or
to poor families in particular, and have been found to
have a strong impact on various dimensions of human
development, whether they are explicitly linked to
health- and education-related conditions (conditional
cash transfer programmes) or not (unconditional cash
transfer programmes). Conditional cash transfer programmes make the payment of cash benefits conditional
upon compliance with specific “behavioural” conditions. Typically, the programmes require that families
ensure their children’s enrolment and attendance at
school, and participate in specified health programmes,
for example making regular visits to a clinic, or presenting children for vaccinations – stipulations that make

demands on the availability, accessibility and quality of
such services. If beneficiaries do not meet the specified
conditions, sanctions may be applied, typically through
the suspension or termination of benefits. Given that the
beneficiaries are likely to be poor or very poor, the very
potential for sanctions may itself be controversial, and
the human rights implications of behavioural conditions
in cash transfer programmes have been subject of intense
debate (see e.g. ILO, 2011a, pp. 118–120; de Brauw and
Hoddinott, 2008; Dornan and Porter, 2013).9
The considerable variety of cash transfer programmes
that have emerged in recent years is only insufficiently
described by the usual dichotomy of conditional and
non-conditional programmes. Following the establishment of the Progresa/Oportunidades programme in
Mexico, the first wave of conditional cash transfer programmes was concentrated in Latin America (Fiszbein
and Schady, 2009; Barrientos, 2013), where conditional
cash transfer programmes are now firmly established as
an integral element of many national social security systems (see figure 2.7). By now, the largest programme in
absolute terms is Bolsa Família in Brazil, which reaches
around 11.3  million families comprising 46  million people, corresponding to about a quarter of Brazil’s population – at an annual cost of US$3.9 billion
(0.4 per cent of GDP). Similar programmes were implemented in 16 other Latin American and Caribbean
countries, covering around 70 million people or 12 per
cent of the population in the region (figure 2.7). Some
programmes have developed distinctive features, such as
the individualized support and transformational nature
of the Chilean Chile Solidario programme (replaced
by the Ingreso Ético Familiar programme in 2012; see
UNICEF, 2012). Several cash transfer programmes for
children and families also exist in Africa (e.g. in Ghana,
Kenya, Malawi and South Africa) and in Asia (e.g. in
Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan).
Some programmes combine conditional and nonconditional elements, such as the universal child allowance in Argentina (see box 2.4 below). In other
countries, many of them in Africa, behavioural conditions are nominally part of the design of cash transfer
programmes, yet are not fully implemented and monitored in practice. Some of these programmes have been
introduced with “soft” conditions, under which the
extent to which sanctions (usually the suspension or

8  Because of their strong focus on children, cash transfer programmes are often considered as child or family benefit programmes, although
it may also be argued that they share many features with generalized social assistance schemes.
9  Moreover, as the responsibility for meeting these conditions mostly falls on mothers, these programmes have further-reaching
implications for women’s social and economic rights (e.g. Molyneux, 2007).

termination of benefits) are applied in cases of noncompliance takes into account the influence of factors
beyond the beneficiaries’ control, especially in respect
of the poorest and most vulnerable. In some cases, conditions are applied, if at all, with considerable discretion, particularly in contexts where there is a significant
lack of infrastructure and qualified staff. Where institutional capacities are limited, a strict adherence to
behavioural conditions would be neither feasible nor
equitable, given the often insufficient supply of education and health services, in terms of both quantity and
quality, especially in remote areas.
The extension of cash transfer programmes for children and families has continued during recent years, and
in some countries has even accelerated, whether in order
to cushion the impact of the global crisis on children and
families or with a more general objective of reducing poverty. In Haiti, a new conditional cash transfer scheme
(Ti Manman Cheri) was introduced in 2012, with an
initial annual budget estimated at US$13 million. In
Honduras, the Bono 10,000 conditional cash transfer
programme now provides cash benefits to poor families
with children under 18 or pregnant women on condition

that they commit to obligations with regard to school attendance and health care. In Mexico, the nutrition support programme Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL)
was expanded within the framework of the Oportunidades programme in 2010. Brazil extended coverage of
the Bolsa Família programme by including more beneficiary categories, implementing an “active search” strategy to register extremely poor families not yet covered
and increasing the amount of benefit paid. The budget
has increased from 11.9 billion real (BRL) in 2009 to
BRL23  billion in 2013, constituting approximately
0.5 per cent of GDP (Hermeto and Caetano, forthcoming). Thailand extended its education policy from 12 years
of free basic education to 15 years in 2009 as part of its
first stimulus package, allocating 18 billion baht to this
programme in the first year with a view to drawing all
children, including stateless and ethnic minority children,
and children of migrants, into education from pre-school
through high school and vocational education. Germany
increased the level of child benefits in 2009 and 2010.
Japan established a new universal allowance for children
“of junior high school age” in 2010, and in 2012 made further changes to the law to allow for higher benefit levels,

2. Social protection for children and families

Box 2.4  The universal child allowance in Argentina
Argentina closed a gap in the coverage of child benefits through the introduction of the universal child allowance (Asignación universal por hijo) for up to five children per family in 2009. This benefit complements
the existing contributory family benefits for formal sector workers in the low and middle wage brackets and
income tax rebates for workers in the highest income group. The scheme covers children of Argentinian
nationality or children who have been resident in the country for at least three years whose parents fall
into one of the following categories and do not already receive any other type of social assistance payments: those subject to the social monotributo (simplified social security regime for workers with very low
incomes); the unemployed; those working in the informal economy; and domestic workers earning less than
the adjustable minimum living wage. In addition to the 4.3 million children already covered through the
other schemes (contributory family allowance and income tax rebate), the scheme now provides benefits to
3.3 million more children, representing 29 per cent of all children under the age of 18.
Families receive 460 pesos (ARS), equivalent to about US$69, for each child under 18, or ARS1,500 (about
US$224) for a child with an assessed disability (without age limit). Of the total benefit, 80 per cent is paid
monthly to benefit recipients through the social insurance institution. The remaining 20 per cent is deposited in a savings account in the name of the beneficiary with the National Bank. This sum can be recovered
(on behalf of children in their care up to the age of six) when the beneficiary provides evidence of the children having undergone medical check-ups and necessary vaccinations or (for children aged 5–18) being
enrolled in public education.
The cost of the scheme is estimated at approximately 0.5 per cent of GDP, financed out of earningsrelated contributions and taxes and the annual interest on the Sustainability Guarantee Fund of the state
pension system, created in 2007.
It is estimated that the scheme reaches 70 per cent of children living in poverty (between 80 and 90 per
cent of very poor children) and that it reduces the proportion of poor and very poor children by 18 per cent
and 65 per cent, respectively. Some 40 per cent of those who receive this benefit are not poor, most of
them belonging to households with total incomes only slightly above the value of the poverty line. The Gini
index shows a drop of approximately one percentage point as a result of the scheme. The combined impact
of the contributory and non-contributory schemes is to reduce inequality by approximately 5 per cent. The
total income of the poorest 10 per cent is increased by approximately 30 per cent as a result of the benefit.

depending on age and number of children in a household, while also reintroducing an income ceiling above
which a household was not eligible for the allowance.
While universal or quasi-universal coverage of all
children is achieved predominantly in high-income
countries, some middle-income countries have made
great strides towards universal coverage: for example, in
Argentina (see box 2.4), the universal child allowance
introduced in 2009 extended coverage to families of unemployed people and those in the informal economy
who were previously uncovered (Bertranou and Maurizio, 2012a). Mongolia also reintroduced its child allowance with virtually universal coverage, covering close to
900,000 children (99.6 per cent of all children) in 2012;
the programme is funded from a mineral resource tax accumulated in the country’s Human Development Fund.
Some initiatives represent notable progress towards
more nearly universal coverage anchored in national
legislation. The South African Child Support Grant,
for example (see box 2.5), although means tested, covers
more than half of all children under the age of 18,

and has had significant impacts on children’s nutrition, physical development and education (e.g. Patel
et al., 2012; Patel, Hochfeld and Moodley, 2013; DSD,
SASSA and UNICEF South Africa, 2012; Eyal and
Woolard, 2013). In Colombia, a law was passed in 2011
that rendered access to the Más Familias en Acción programme a right, and raised benefit levels; as a result, the
number of beneficiaries increased from 2.1 million to
2.6 million (Alviar García, 2013).
In many low- and middle-income countries, only a
small minority of children and families receive child
benefits. Where specific child or family benefit programmes do exist, they tend to be largely focused on
workers in the formal economy and/or selected categories of disadvantaged children, such as orphans and
vulnerable children. For example, the Kesejahteraan
Sosial Anak programme (PKSA) in Indonesia provides
conditional cash benefits for several categories of vulnerable children, including abandoned children, street
children, young offenders and children with disabil­
ities.10 Many general social assistance programmes also

more than half of all children under the age of 18.1 Coverage has been significantly extended by gradually
increasing the maximum age threshold from seven years before 2003 to 18 years in 2008, and by adjusting
the income threshold to inflation.
A monthly benefit of 300 rand (ZAR), equivalent to about US$28, per child is provided to caregivers who
are South African nationals or permanent residents, and whose annual earnings are below ZAR34,800 for
a single adult and ZAR69,600 for a couple. Applicants need to provide proof of income or of their status
as unemployed, as appropriate. However, in order to facilitate access to the benefit for eligible families,
particularly the poorest, the Government made efforts to disseminate information about eligibility criteria,
simplify the procedure and reduce the number of documents applicants needed.
By and large, the grant is considered to have been successful in targeting poor households and to have
had a marked impact on children’s lives. In addition to poverty alleviation, studies also demonstrated
positive effects on early childhood development, school attendance and educational attainments, including
narrowing the schooling gap between children whose mothers have less education and those with more,
improvements in overall health status, and reductions in risky behaviours by adolescents. Early enrolment
in the programme was found to produce stronger impacts. Beyond the children themselves, the grant also
facilitated access to the labour market for unemployed caregivers, especially for women.
  Conclusive interpretation of the available coverage data presents some difficulties.

Box 2.6  Providing benefits for orphans and vulnerable children:
The Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme in Ghana
The Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty programme (LEAP) is a conditional cash transfer programme,
currently implemented in about half of Ghana’s districts, which targets extremely poor households that
include one or more orphans and vulnerable children, people over the age of 65 or people with a severe
disability. Orphans and vulnerable children are defined as children under 18 years of age who have lost one
or both parents, who are chronically ill or living in a household headed by a child or a chronically ill person,
or whose parents’ whereabouts are unknown.
Of the 246,115 beneficiaries, 48.2 per cent are children up to 17 years of age. Depending on the number
of eligible individuals in the household, the monthly benefit amounts to 24–45 cedi (about US$9–17),
paid every two months. A recent UNICEF study (Cooke et al., 2014) showed that scaling up the LEAP programme to 500,000 beneficiaries could alleviate the impact on the poorest groups in the population of the
removal of the fuel subsidy; even so, further measures will be necessary to have a broader impact on the
reduction and prevention of poverty.
Beneficiary households with children under the age of 15 commit themselves to certain co-responsibilities
when they sign up for LEAP. These include school attendance (with a maximum absenteeism of 20 per
cent) and vaccinations and health check-ups for children under the age of five. Households in communities
that are not covered by education or health facilities or where the capacity of existing facilities is insufficient
are exempted from these conditions. Monitoring of compliance should take place every three months,
and households not complying should receive warnings, house visits and, in the case of repeated noncompliance, penalties; but for the time being these are soft conditions, as no reliable mechanism to monitor
compliance is currently in place.
In order to ensure they have access to health care, LEAP beneficiaries are automatically registered in the
National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). As a result, beneficiaries are more likely to be covered under the
NHIS than non-recipient households, although those also benefit from contribution exemptions for children,
pregnant women, older people and the very poor (Handa et al., 2013).

benefit children living in vulnerable households, such
as the Programa Subsidio de Alimentos cash transfer
programme in Mozambique, whose total budget allocation more than doubled from 0.16 to 0.35 per cent
of GDP between 2008 and 2013 (Cunha et al., 2013).
Many of the newer programmes in African countries,

though they may be of significant size, operate as pilot
programmes covering only certain districts, such as the
LEAP programme in Ghana (see box 2.6) and similar
schemes in Kenya and Malawi (García and Moore,
2012; Monchuk, 2014).

2. Social protection for children and families

Recent developments have also demonstrated that
cash transfers alone cannot offer income security for
all children and families. More attention is needed
to the formulation and application of integrated approaches that ensure effective coordination between
different policy areas addressing children’s needs, including health, education, care and child protection.
In addition, connection with employment policies is of
critical importance. A particular policy concern is establishing the optimal mix in provision of allowances
in cash, on the one hand, and the availability and accessibility of quality childcare services and early childhood education, on the other – the latter playing a key
role in protecting children from poverty by allowing
their parents to work knowing that their children are
well cared for (e.g. OECD, 2011a; UNICEF and ILO,
2013; ILO and UNDP, 2009; UNESCO, 2014). Such
measures can have a significant impact on the income
security of families with children, in particular for single-parent families.
Rich evidence of the impact of social protection
policies, combined with other social policies, on the
income security of children can be found in many
­E uropean and some other OECD countries. The
OECD has developed a sophisticated monitoring
system, using a set of indicators and focused research

studies, to analyse the availability of child and family
benefits and other family-oriented policies and their
outcomes (OECD, 2009c; OECD, 2011a; OECD,
2014b). Such a monitoring system can also facilitate national monitoring of the implementation of ILO Recommendation No. 202. Strengthening such national
monitoring capacities should be a priority in many lowand middle-income countries.

2.5 How fiscal consolidation and adjustment
measures threaten income security for
children and families
While many countries have in recent years taken decisive steps to extend coverage of child and family protection measures and increase benefit levels, others have
cut back provision in this area as part of fiscal consolidation measures implemented in the wake of the global
crisis (see box 2.7). Some countries (e.g. Denmark, Ireland, Israel) have reduced the level of child benefits for
all children, or for children in larger families; others
(e.g. Denmark, Latvia) have introduced an effective
ceiling on the total amount of child benefits or lowered the maximum age up to which children are eligible
for child benefits (e.g. Ireland, Latvia). Some countries

Box 2.7  The effects of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures on child and family benefits
Several countries, in particular in the developed world, have in recent years adopted contraction measures
that have affected child and family benefits, a few in the early stages of the crisis (e.g. Ireland, Estonia) and
more since 2010. Examples of such measures include the following:
•	 In Denmark, child benefits were successively reduced by 5 per cent each year in 2011, 2012 and 2013,
and a ceiling on total child benefits was set at 35,000 kroner per year.
•	 In Ireland’s 2013 budget, the child benefit payment level was reduced for the third time since 2010, in
addition to other measures. Overall, a family with two children will have lost €864 in annual support since
2010. Back-to-school allowances were also cut in the 2012 and 2013 budgets.
•	 Israel announced the reduction of child allowances for children born after 1 June 2003 to a flat amount
of 140 shekels (ILS), about US$39, for each child, replacing the earlier system of benefit rates increasing with the number of children. The cuts in child allowances are expected to save the Government
ILS2.9 billion in 2014.
•	 In Latvia, family benefits were reduced to a flat amount per child, replacing the higher benefit rates for
subsequent children in a household, thereby effectively reducing the total amount of child benefits for
larger families. In addition, the maximum eligible age was reduced from 20 to 19 years for children in
education.
•	 In Mongolia, the Child Money Programme was terminated at the end of 2009. However, in 2012 it was
reintroduced as a universal programme.
•	 The United Kingdom’s 2012 budget introduced a progressive income tax charge on child benefit in order
to offset the value of the benefit for people earning over £60,000. Individuals earning between £50,000
and £60,000 will be charged with a portion of the amount of the benefit. The charge applies to the
higher-earning partner in households receiving child benefit. Changes to the rules on child benefit are
expected to reduce the entitlement of about 1.2 million families.

effectively excluded more affluent families by introducing an asset test (e.g. Cyprus) or a tax for those earning
above a certain threshold which claws back the child
benefit (United Kingdom), thus restricting the universal scope of such benefits.
Unless other compensatory measures are taken,
these developments are likely to threaten the income
security of families with children, particularly that of
larger families, many of which are already at higher
risk of poverty than others. There is a risk that in some
countries such measures may jeopardize the progress
achieved in reducing child poverty in recent years.
Indeed, child poverty has increased in 19 of the
28 Member States of the European Union between
2007 and 2012; by the latter year, more than one-quarter

of children in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, R
­ omania and
Spain were living at risk of poverty.11 This increase in
child poverty has given rise to concern about negative
long-term effects with regard to the future employment prospects of today’s children, and about the
future productivity and competitiveness of European
­economies (European Commission, 2014a).
The increasing pressure on public budgets in many
emerging economies may slow down further progress
with respect to the income security of children and families, or even reverse the improvements already achieved.
It is therefore essential to ensure that fiscal consolidation measures do not compromise the successes achieved
to date in many countries through a broad and integrated range of social protection policies for children.

3.1 Introduction: The quest for income security
Social protection for women and men of working age1
includes a range of aspects. This chapter will focus in
particular on income security, which is an essential
component of the well-being of individuals and families. An overall majority of people of working age are
economically active, and generally gain their livelihoods
through income-generating activity, whether in formal
or informal employment, and whether such activity
can be categorized as decent work2 or not. The social
security needs of people of working age generally fall
into three broad categories: first, the need to replace
income lost temporarily or permanently as a result of
1  Working age is broadly defined here as the age range during which
most people are, or seek to be, economically active, reflecting the
life-cycle approach of the Social Protection Floors Recommendation,
2012 (No. 202), and being aware that in many contexts women and
men continue to be economically active, out of choice or necessity, until
well into old age (see Chapter 4). The upper and lower boundaries of
“working age” are highly dependent on national contexts, as defined by
national legislation and practice, and often depend on the length of time
that people spend in education and statutory pensionable ages. For the
purpose of the comparability of statistical indicators, this report follows
established international practice in using an age range of 15–64 years,
but this is not to imply that all individuals within this age range can or
should conform to a specific notion of “work” or “activity”.
2  Decent work has been defined by the ILO and endorsed by the
international community as productive work for women and men in
conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. Decent
work involves opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a
fair income; provides security in the workplace and social protection
for workers and their families; offers better prospects for personal
development and encourages social integration; gives people the
freedom to express their concerns, to organize and to participate in
decisions that affect their lives; and guarantees equal opportunities and
equal treatment for all.

KEY MESSAGES
nn Social protection supports women and men
of working age by stabilizing their incomes
in the event of unemployment, employment
injury, disability, sickness and maternity,
and by ensuring that they have at least a
basic level of income security.
nn While the labour market serves as the primary source of income security during
working life, social security plays a major
role in smoothing incomes and aggregate
demand, thereby facilitating structural
change within economies.
nn Worldwide, 2.3 per cent of GDP is allocated
to public social protection expenditure
ensuring income security during working
age; regionally, levels vary widely, ranging
from 0.5 per cent in Africa to 5.9 per cent
in Western Europe.
nn Better social protection, including support
in coping with the financial consequences
of life events and improved access to health
care, will help workers to find and sustain
decent and productive employment.
nn Policy coherence between social protection
policies on the one hand, and employment,
labour market and wage policies on the
other, is essential in order to ensure that
social security systems are efficient,
effective and sustainable.

unemployment, employment injury, disability, sickness
or maternity; second, the need for income support or
other social protection measures where income is insufficient to avoid poverty and/or social exclusion; and
third, the need for support to restore earning capacity
after any of the contingencies listed above and to facilitate participation in employment.
According to the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), the objective of national
social protection floors is to guarantee, at a minimum,
“basic income security, at least at a nationally defined
minimum level, for persons in active age who are unable
to earn sufficient income, in particular in cases of sickness, unemployment, maternity and disability”. Other
ILO social security standards provide more detailed
guidance for specific policy areas. The following sections of this chapter will focus on four policy areas most
relevant to people of working age, namely, unemployment protection (section 3.2), employment injury protection (section 3.3), disability benefits (section 3.4)
and maternity protection (section 3.5). Access to health
and sickness benefits, which also have important implications for income security during working age, is discussed in Chapter 5.
Most people seek income security during working
life in the first instance through participation in the
labour market. Income security is strongly dependent
on the level, distribution and stability of earnings and
other income from work, and is therefore significantly
influenced by policy choices and the adoption and enforcement of legislation in a number of areas. Policy
areas particularly relevant to income security include
employment, employment protection, wages (including minimum wages) and collective bargaining, and
active labour market policies, as well as policies to support workers with family and care responsibilities and to
promote gender equality in employment. Recent labour
market and employment trends have increased the pressure on social security systems to ensure income security
for persons of working age. These trends include in particular higher risks of unemployment, underemployment
and informality (e.g. ILO, 2014a; ILO, 2014b); increasing prevalence of precarious forms of work; and declining wage shares, dwindling real wages and inadequate
wages (e.g. ILO, 2013b; ILO, 2014c), leading to persistently high proportions of working poor (ILO, 2014a).
In the light of these observations, it is very clear that
income security cannot be achieved by social security
alone. Social protection policies need to be coordinated
with well-designed policies to address these challenges
in the fields of employment, labour market and wage

policies, with a view to alleviating excessive burdens on
national social security systems and allowing them to
work more efficiently and more effectively.
Most employment-related, contributory social security programmes cover those people (and their dependants) who have been economically active in the
past, but have lost their income from work either permanently or temporarily owing to loss of their current
job (unemployment benefits), sickness, longer-term disability or death resulting from a work-related accident
or disease (employment injury benefits), circumstances
not directly related to work (general sickness, disability
and survivors’ benefits) or pregnancy, childbirth and
family responsibilities (maternity, paternity or parental
benefits, child or family benefits).
However, these types of programme often do not
cover the situations and needs of people (and their
dependants) who are economically active but not in
formal employment, whose income from employment
is too low to prevent them and their families from falling into poverty, or who simply have no income at all,
having been unemployed or underemployed for too
long to qualify for benefits, with no prospect of such
a situation coming to an end, even in the long term.
These three groups – those in the informal economy,
the working poor in formal employment and the longterm unemployed – usually fall outside the coverage of
contributory social security programmes.
People in these groups may be covered by non-contributory programmes providing benefits in cash and in
kind, such as social assistance or universal schemes. In
countries where a large majority of the labour force is
covered by contributory social insurance programmes,
non-contributory programmes are most frequently
addressed to those who are not covered by social insurance, namely, the long-term unemployed and the
working poor. In economies where informality and
large-scale poverty prevails, for many decades social assistance programmes, if they existed at all, were typically
small and fragmented. However, in many such countries
the last two decades have seen the development of largescale non-contributory programmes targeted mainly at
poor households. These sometimes link entitlements to
benefits to beneficiaries’ participation in public service
programmes such as health care or education (usually
referred to as conditional cash transfers or CCTs), or to
participation in public employment programmes (often
referred to as cash-for-work programmes), vocational
training or entrepreneurship support programmes.
While this chapter will focus mainly on cash benefits, it is important to note that benefits in kind, in

particular health care and other social services, play an
important role in ensuring income security for people
of working age. The role of health-care provision (see
Chapter 5 for more detail) is particularly important in
this respect: people who enjoy effective access to quality public health services or are financially protected
through affordable (social) health insurance will have
higher income security than those at risk of having to
pay high out-of-pocket costs for health care in times of
need. The provision of other social services and related
benefits in kind that have a monetary value, including education and care services, can also significantly
reduce people’s income needs. The provision of services
such as employment services, skills development programmes, childcare facilities and long-term care services
may also have an impact on people’s ability to engage
in paid employment, with important implications for
income security, particularly for women (e.g. Martínez
Franzoni and Sanchéz-Ancochea, 2014).
Worldwide, about one-third of total non-health
public social protection expenditure, amounting to
2.3 per cent of GDP, is spent on benefits for people of
working age (see figures 3.1 and 3.2).3 These include
unemployment benefits, employment injury benefits,
disability benefits, maternity benefits and general social
assistance. Within this overall figure, regional variations
are significant, ranging from less than 0.5 per cent in
Africa and 1.5 per cent in Asia and the Pacific to 5.9 per
cent in Western European countries. While non-health

public social protection expenditure for people of working age accounts for close to one-third of overall nonhealth social protection expenditure in Western Europe,
it accounts for roughly half of this category of expenditure in Latin America and in the Middle East. In
Africa, such expenditure accounts for about one-­quarter
of non-health social protection expenditure, a lower proportion which can partly be explained by a lower share
of working-age population in total population and a
relatively high proportion of expenditure on pensions
in total public non-health social protection expenditure.
The remainder of this chapter is divided into four
sections, dealing respectively with the areas of social security that are most relevant to people of working age,
namely:
•	 unemployment benefits;
•	 employment injury benefits;
•	 disability benefits;
•	 maternity protection.
Many countries have already put in place or are designing new schemes that are broader in scope and less
closely focused on the occurrence of specific contingencies. In many cases, national social security systems
combine contributory schemes with non-contributory
schemes in order to extend social protection to those
with no or weak contributory capacities. Together,
these schemes contribute to building national social
protection floors and national social security systems.

3  This also includes expenditure on general social assistance programmes, which accounts for 0.8 per cent of GDP worldwide (2.7 per cent
in Latin America).

3.2 Unemployment protection
KEY MESSAGES
nn Where they exist, unemployment benefit schemes play a key role in providing income security to
workers and their families in the event of temporary unemployment, thereby contributing to preventing
poverty; supporting structural change in the economy; providing safeguards against informalization;
and, in the event of a crisis, stabilizing aggregate demand, helping the economy to recover more quickly.
nn Only 28 per cent of the global labour force is potentially eligible for benefits (contributory or noncontributory) under existing legislation in case of unemployment. Within this overall figure, regional
differences are considerable: 80 per cent of the labour force is so covered in Europe, 38 per cent
in Latin America, 21 per cent in the Middle East, 17 per cent in the Asia and Pacific region, and
8 per cent in Africa.
nn Only 12 per cent of unemployed workers worldwide actually receive unemployment benefits, and
again regional differences are large, with effective coverage ranging from 64 per cent of unemployed
workers in Western Europe to just over 7 per cent in the Asia and Pacific region, 5 per cent in Latin
America and the Caribbean and less than 3 per cent in the Middle East and Africa.
nn A growing number of countries are extending the scope of protection offered under unemployment
benefit schemes by including employment promotion measures such as skills development and
employment services as part of the package, in combination with unemployment cash benefits.
nn Linking employment and social protection policies, by combining cash transfers with public employment
programmes (employment guarantee schemes), vocational training and/or support for entrepreneurship,
offers new possibilities for providing income security to unemployed and underemployed workers in
countries with high levels of informality.

3.2.1 Protecting incomes, cushioning
demand shocks and facilitating
structural change in the economy
Unemployment protection schemes provide income support over a determined period of time to unemployed
people who are capable of working. Their objective is to
provide at least partial income replacement for the loss
of earnings resulting from temporary unemployment,
enabling the beneficiary to maintain a certain standard
of living during the transition period until he or she obtains suitable employment (see ILO, 2010a, pp. 57–58)
and, increasingly, also to provide support in finding
employment through a range of promotional measures
and services. Under most schemes, cash benefits are available only in cases of involuntary unemployment,4 and are
restricted in duration (see box 3.1); under many schemes,
they are combined with services such as support, counselling and advice in looking for employment, and facilities for enhancing, updating and developing skills.
In “normal” times, such schemes aim to meet the
needs of individuals whose job losses reflect basic levels
of turnover in the labour market, and thus to play a

key role in supporting job mobility and facilitating
structural change in the economy. In addition to guaranteeing income security for unemployed workers, unemployment protection schemes can also help protect
them from slipping into informality, and support their
search for new jobs in which they can apply existing or
new skills in a productive way.
The repercussions for employment of the global
crisis of 2008–09 have highlighted the wider role of
unemployment benefits in helping both people and
economies to adjust to shocks and to structural changes
in the economy. Indeed, following sharp increases in
unemployment rates in many parts of the world in the
wake of the global crisis (ILO, 2013c), unemployment
protection schemes have proved more important than
ever both in providing income security to individuals
and households and, by stabilizing aggregate demand,
in fostering rapid recovery from the crisis.
Whether temporary unemployment is the result of
covariant shocks, as in the event of the global crisis, or
of the constant structural change undergone by economies and labour markets, unemployment benefits represent an effective tool to guarantee income security to

4  Involuntary unemployment excludes cases where an employee leaves a job of her or his own volition, without just cause (e.g. harassment,
resignation under threat), or where the employee has deliberately contributed to her or his own dismissal.

Box 3.1  International standards on unemployment protection

30

Giving effect to the right to social security enshrined in various international human rights instruments
requires that effective social protection be guaranteed in the event of unemployment. Unemployment is
recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 (UDHR) as one of the contingencies to be
covered by national social security systems (Art. 25(1)). The right to access and maintain benefits, in cash
or in kind, without discrimination, to secure protection from, among other things, unemployment, is considered as forming part of the right to social security as laid down in the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, 1966 (Art. 9) (see also UN, 2008, paras 2 and 16).
ILO Conventions and Recommendations take a broad approach to unemployment protection by setting
standards for the provision of cash benefits and services during periods of unemployment involving a suspension of earnings, thereby giving practical guidance for the implementation of the right to social security. Their
objective is twofold: to ensure that individuals enjoy income security despite the loss of earnings suffered as
a result of unemployment, and to support beneficiaries in finding productive and freely chosen employment.
The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), requires the provision of cash
benefits to unemployed persons capable of and available for work but unable to obtain suitable employment.
It sets qualitative and quantitative benchmarks that must be met, at a minimum, (1) to ensure the coverage
of a substantial amount of the population, (2) to ensure that the level of cash benefits represents at least
a certain percentage of beneficiaries’ former earnings and are thus deemed sufficient to serve as income
replacement, or that they are sufficient to allow beneficiaries and their families to enjoy decent standards of
living and health (see Annex III), and (3) to ensure that cash benefits are provided for a period of time that
is long enough for them to serve their purpose.
The Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988 (No. 168), increases the level and scope of protection that should be provided to the unemployed. In addition to full unemployment, it covers partial unemployment (i.e. temporary reduction in the number of working hours) and
temporary suspension of work, as well as part-time work for those who are seeking full-time work. It also requires the provision of social benefits to certain categories of persons who have never been, or have ceased
to be, recognized as unemployed or covered by unemployment protection schemes (e.g. new entrants to
the labour market, those previously self-employed, etc.). Convention No. 168 further expands the scope of
support that should be provided to the unemployed by calling upon the combination of cash benefits with
measures that promote job opportunities and employment assistance (e.g. employment services, vocational
training and guidance), prioritizing support to disadvantaged persons. Its accompanying Recommendation,
No. 176, provides guidance on how to assess the suitability of employment for those seeking it, taking into
account the age of unemployed persons, their length of service in their former occupation, their acquired
experience, the length of their unemployment and the state of the labour market.
The Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), guides countries in defining and guaranteeing basic income security, at least at a nationally defined minimum level, to all persons of working age
who are unable to earn sufficient income, for reasons including unemployment, as part of a national social
protection floor. Such guarantee should be provided at least to all residents, and may be furnished through
a variety of means including universal schemes, social insurance, social assistance, negative income tax,
and/or public employment and employment support programmes. In a spirit similar to that of Convention
No. 168, it recommends that the design and implementation of social protection floor guarantees combine
preventive, promotional and active measures; that they promote productive economic activity and formal
employment through labour market policies and policies that promote education, vocational training, productive skills and employability; and that they are well coordinated with other policies that enhance formal
employment, income generation, education, literacy, vocational training, skills and employability, that reduce
precariousness, and that promote secure work, entrepreneurship and sustainable enterprises within a decent work framework.

individuals, smooth economic changes and stabilize aggregate consumption.
Most unemployment benefit programmes are designed to cover workers in formal employment who
lose their jobs and find themselves temporarily unable
to obtain suitable new employment. Most such programmes do not protect unemployed people who have
had no formal employment in the recent past, the longterm unemployed, the underemployed or the working
poor.

In countries with high levels of informality, wider
non-contributory social assistance programmes combining employment and social protection policies have
been developed to provide some income security for
unemployed and underemployed workers. These include employment guarantee schemes and other public
employment programmes, as well as programmes that
combine cash transfers with support for skills development and creation of employment and entrepreneurship
opportunities.

3.2.2 Types of unemployment
protection schemes
Countries use different contributory or non-contributory mechanisms of unemployment protection, or combinations thereof (figure 3.3). The main types may be
summarized as follows.
Contributory unemployment benefit schemes. These
most commonly take the form of social insurance (unemployment insurance), financed by contributions paid
by employers, or shared between employers and employees, and usually cover workers in formal employment,
on whose behalf regular contributions can be collected.5
Unemployment insurance schemes have strong merits
in terms of solidarity-based risk-sharing, their capacity
to provide benefits in the form of periodical payments,
and their potential to act across national economies as
automatic stabilizers.
Non-contributory unemployment benefit schemes.
These are often referred to as unemployment assistance,

are usually funded at least partially through general taxation, and tend to provide a lower level of benefits than
insurance schemes to unemployed workers who either
do not qualify for contributory benefits (e.g. because of
a short contribution period) or have exhausted their en­
titlement to unemployment insurance benefit.
Social security systems providing both contributory and non-contributory unemployment benefits
are closely aligned with the fundamental framework
of ILO standards, which stipulates that risk should
be shared on a collective basis and contribution payments organized accordingly. These benefits are also
in nearly all cases combined with measures to facilitate a rapid return to employment and/or upgrading of
skills, thereby embodying the combination of income
replacement and employment promotion that lies at
the core of Convention No. 168 and Recommendations
Nos 176 and 202 (see box 3.1).
Unemployment savings schemes (sometimes misleadingly called unemployment insurance savings accounts

Scandinavian countries, where unemployment protection has traditionally been provided by trade unions and is supplemented by
non‑contributory schemes.

or UISA) require workers to accumulate savings in
individual accounts, which provide for a stream of
income in case of unemployment. Schemes of this type
lack the key design element of risk-pooling; as a result,
when an individual’s savings run out, so does her or
his income protection – and this may happen quickly.
In addition, those workers who will be able to save
most in their individual accounts tend to be the ones
least prone to the risk of unemployment, while those at
highest risk tend to have difficulties in building up sufficiently high savings to generate a significant income.
So it cannot be said that such schemes either provide
the same level of individual protection offered by social
insurance schemes or are capable of acting as automatic
stabilizers of aggregate demand in the same way. In
addition, where such schemes allow borrowing from
pension accounts, the result may be seriously reduced
income security in old age.
Employment guarantee schemes.  These provide a
legal entitlement to employment in public works and
cash transfers to poor workers in rural settings, and

constitute one of the policy options that can be used
to enhance income security for the working poor and
employability. The largest and most closely studied
scheme of this type is the Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)
in India (see box 3.3). Ethiopia, too, has implemented a
large-scale programme which, although not providing a
legally guaranteed income, combines public works with
food and cash benefits: the Productive Safety Nets Programme (PSNP).
Severance pay.  In many countries, this is the only
form of income protection available to workers dismissed from certain forms of formal employment. This
type of compensation, however, should be seen as representing a form of deferred pay or enforced savings by
workers, rather than a form of social risk-­sharing. It
offers little help to the unemployed in terms of helping them back to work, or to employers who may need
to make structural changes to their businesses, and
may indeed have negative effects.6 For this reason,
unemployment benefits  –  generally in the form of

6  In imposing an obligation to pay laid-off workers a lump sum proportionate to their prior job tenure, severance pay may pose a high
burden on employers, especially those in economic difficulties, and is therefore prone to evasion and poor enforcement. Many employers that
go bankrupt face difficulties in finding the severance payments due to their dismissed workers. Thus, severance pay cannot be considered as a
substitute for periodic unemployment benefits (see ILO, 2010a; Holzmann et al., 2011; Sarra, 2008).

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

periodic payments – are considered more supportive of
structural transformation in the economy than severance pay.
Not all of these different mechanisms of unemployment protection provide a clearly defined legal entitlement to a periodic unemployment benefit, setting out
eligibility conditions, the nature and level of the benefit,
the duration of payment, and obligations with regard to
jobseeking and the acceptance of a suitable job.
At present, the majority (112 countries; 56 per cent)
of the 201 countries reviewed in this report have no
unemployment benefit scheme anchored in national
legislation. However, 31 of these countries provide severance payment for workers covered by the labour code,
which provides a limited level of protection to some
workers.
Of the 89 countries (44 per cent) that have legislative provision for some sort of social security benefits in case of unemployment, more than 95 per cent
(85  countries) provide periodic cash benefits to unemployed persons meeting the prescribed qualifying
conditions. Public social insurance is by far the most
common mechanism used to provide such regular
income replacement. Social insurance, subsidized voluntary insurance or mandatory private insurance are

complemented in one-third of these 89 countries by
social assistance when rights to insurance payments
have been exhausted or are not met. A few countries,
including Australia, New Zealand and the Seychelles,
provide only non-contributory benefits.
Contributory or non-contributory unemployment
benefit schemes are predominantly to be found in advanced economies, but schemes providing for some
form of unemployment benefits have also been introduced in middle-income countries (see figure 3.4).

3.2.3 Legal coverage for
unemployment benefits
Figure 3.5 sets out the overall picture as to the proportion of the labour force protected by unemployment
protection schemes according to national legislation
(legal coverage ratio).
At the global level, only 28.1  per cent of the
labour force is potentially eligible for unemployment
benefit under existing national legislation, providing
the fact that the laws are properly implemented and
enforced. This proportion is based on a broad definition including mandatory unemployment insurance,

unemployment assistance and employment guarantees,
as well as a very few voluntary schemes (see figures 3.3
and 3.4). The variation between regions is considerable (see figures 3.5 and 3.6): while 80–90 per cent of
the labour force in North America and Europe is covered by law by an unemployment benefit scheme, only
37.6 per cent of the labour force in Latin America is so
protected, along with 20.6 per cent of the labour force
in the Middle East, 16.6 per cent in the Asia and Pacific region,7 and just 8.4 per cent of the labour force in
Africa. Where coverage is low, this is usually because
unemployment benefit schemes do not exist and, where
they do exist, usually cover only those working in the
formal economy. There are marked gender differences
in unemployment protection coverage in some regions,
especially the Middle East, where only 17.7 per cent of
the female labour force is protected by law, compared
to 20.6 per cent of the total labour force, and in North
Africa, where 20.9 per cent of the female labour force is
protected, compared to 27 per cent of the overall labour
force.

3.2.4 Effective coverage
by unemployment benefits
Unemployment benefits play a key role in ensuring
income security for unemployed workers and in facilitating their transition to new jobs, particularly if
properly linked to employment services. However, the
proportion of jobseekers receiving unemployment benefits varies widely across and within regions. The extent
and level of effective coverage of unemployment benefit
schemes can be measured by relating the number of
actual recipients of such benefits to the number of unemployed workers at a given point in time.
What is observed, not surprisingly, is that effective
coverage by unemployment benefits is lower than legal
coverage,8 and that this varies widely across regions and
countries (see figures 3.7 and 3.8). While 63.8 per cent
of the unemployed in Western Europe (in some countries, more than 90 per cent) receive unemployment
benefits, including non-contributory benefits, only
21.6 per cent of unemployed workers in Central and
Eastern Europe and 28 per cent of the unemployed in

7  This includes an estimate of legal coverage for India’s employment guarantee scheme, which is based on an estimate of the proportion of
working or unemployed adults in the total rural labour force.
8  It should be noted that indicators for legal and effective coverage are not strictly comparable, as they refer to two different dimensions
of coverage and different reference populations (denominators). The legal coverage indicator refers to people eligible under legislation for
unemployment benefits as a proportion of the total labour force. The effective coverage indicator refers to the proportion of those receiving
unemployment benefits as a proportion of those currently unemployed.

North America do so. Only a small minority of unemployed workers in many developing countries can
expect to receive any kind of cash unemployment protection benefits: 7.2 per cent of unemployed workers in
Asia and the Pacific, 4.6 per cent in Latin America and
the Caribbean, and less than 3 per cent in the Middle
East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. Across the
world, only 11.7 per cent of the unemployed receive unemployment benefits, while the remaining 88.3 per cent
are left without income support.
While the lack of an unemployment protection
scheme is certainly the major reason for the low coverage in global terms, other factors include long contribution periods,9 and a short maximum duration of
payment.10
In most regions – with the notable exception of
Latin America – effective coverage rates have fallen
since 2007 (see figure 3.7). This decrease may be due
to changes in the structure of the unemployed population (for example, more first-time jobseekers or longterm unemployed) or changes in entitlement rules in
unemployment benefit schemes. In Europe and North
America, factors contributing to the steep rise in coverage rates between 2007 and 2009 are likely to have
included more generous rules with regard to eligibility
for unemployment benefits and a higher proportion
of new beneficiaries. The subsequent dramatic fall in
effective coverage ratios in these regions by 2012 may
be attributed to a higher share of long-term unemployment and a consequently higher share of unemployed
having exhausted their entitlement to unemployment
benefit.
Figures 3.7–3.9 indicate that in many countries with
unemployment benefit schemes in place, only a relatively
small proportion of the unemployed actually receive periodic unemployment cash benefits.11 Coverage ratios of
more than two-thirds of the unemployed are reached
in only nine out of the 89 countries that have schemes
of some type in place. Several factors may contribute
to low effective coverage rates. A high proportion of

9  Conventions Nos 102 and 168 both require that the qualifying period
be no longer than necessary to preclude abuse. Countries usually require
either six or 12 months of contributions to qualify. Mongolia has the
highest requirement, at 24 months of contributions, the last nine of
which must be continuous, thereby excluding those with seasonal or
temporary work contracts (Carter, Bédard and Peyron Bista, 2013).
10  While the duration of protection varies widely, on average the
maximum duration for benefit is 45 weeks (55 weeks in advanced
economies; 17 weeks in Latin American countries).
11  Some of those not covered by unemployment benefit schemes may,
however, receive other benefits, such as general social assistance benefits.

unemployed workers may belong to categories often
excluded from legal coverage, such as domestic workers
or part-time workers. A high share of long-term unemployed who have exhausted their benefit entitlement
can also lower the coverage ratio. Other groups may be
excluded from effective coverage because they do not
meet the entitlement conditions, such as unemployed
people (often young people or other workers with short
and/or interrupted employment careers) who have not
accumulated a sufficient contribution or employment
record to be eligible for contributory unemployment
benefits, or, in the case of means-tested benefits, whose
own means are above the threshold set for eligibility for
benefits.
High coverage rates of unemployment benefits are
associated with higher income security for beneficiaries,
provided that benefit levels are adequate. Unemployment benefits play a major role in preventing poverty
for the unemployed, as shown by figure 3.10 for the
Member States of the European Union. In countries
where effective coverage rates of unemployment benefits are lower, the unemployed are more likely to live in
poverty.
Evidence from the European Union also demonstrates that unemployed workers receiving unemployment benefits are more likely to return to work than
those who do not receive any benefits (European Commission, 2014b, p. 163). Unemployment protection
thus plays a key role in facilitating transitions back into
employment and preventing poverty.

3.2.5 Unemployment protection for young people
Unemployment protection for young people constitutes
a particular challenge, exacerbated by the high, and
often growing, unemployment rates of young people
in many countries (ILO, 2013d). The fact that very
large numbers of young people around the world are
unable to gain access to labour markets constitutes an
important problem in itself (ILO, 2012b). Many aspects of this problem, moreover, bring into sharp focus
specific issues in relation to the objectives, design and
implementation of unemployment protection schemes
more generally.
Only a small number of countries (20 out of the
201 reviewed for this report) provide unemployment
benefits for first-time jobseekers, a category of the active
population by definition excluded from the protection
conferred by unemployment protection schemes based
on contributory coverage. In some countries, first-time
jobseekers may be eligible for some form of unemployment assistance; in others, they may have access to noncontributory benefits provided through, for example, a
general social assistance programme. In most countries,
however, first-time jobseekers do not fall within the
remit of any social security schemes.
Even in systems where young unemployed women
and men who have already acquired some work experience may be eligible for some contributory unemployment insurance benefits, they remain less likely
to be eligible for such benefits than older adults, for

two reasons. First, minimum contribution periods in
contributory unemployment insurance programmes
effectively exclude young adults who are made redundant before meeting these minimum contribution periods. Second, young people are more likely to work in
conditions which are not covered by unemployment
insurance, including employment on temporary and
part-time contracts, or in other forms of precarious or
informal employment (see figure 3.11).
Many countries have strengthened their efforts
to combine income support benefits with assistance
in finding new employment, training, retraining and
other measures aimed at increasing employability.
These include specific programmes addressing youth
unemployment, including increasing the quality of apprenticeship systems and other school-to-work transition programmes, providing career guidance and
introducing measures to support the acquisition of
work experience.

One of the most remarkable policy developments in
recent years is the strengthening of unemployment protection policies in emerging economies, in response to
the need both to provide income security for individual
unemployed workers and protect them from slipping
into the informal economy, and to safeguard the nation’s human capital (see e.g. Berg and Salerno, 2008).
Several distinct forms of protection have emerged, including various types of unemployment insurance and
assistance, and employment guarantee schemes. These
different forms respond to different needs and contexts,
and provide different levels of protection.
In some middle-income countries with high level of
informal employment and weak employment services,
unemployment savings schemes (see section 3.2.2 above)
have been promoted, following the example of Chile.12
It has been argued that in such contexts individual accounts are less prone to moral hazard than collectively financed unemployment insurance schemes.13 The Chilean
scheme partially addresses the inability of many workers
to build up sufficiently high savings – one of the major
shortcomings of this type of programme – through a
tax-subsidized solidarity component, which effectively
makes it a hybrid scheme. Some similar programmes,
however (for example in Jordan), lack this component,
instead allowing account-holders to tap into their pension entitlements, which effectively perpetuates income
insecurity into old age. Experience from Chile shows
that coverage remains low and is of greatest benefit to
those at lowest risk of becoming unemployed while not
sufficiently protecting those at greatest need; moreover,
replacement rates tend to be insufficient to provide even
a minimum level of income security (OECD, 2010a).
These difficulties raise fundamental questions as to the
viability of such programmes, unless supported by a large
tax-funded solidarity component.14
A growing number of emerging economies have

13  Proponents of unemployment savings accounts (e.g. Vodopivec, 2009; Robalino, Vodopivec and Bodor, 2010) argue that the fact that
they require the unemployed to draw on their own savings, rather than offering access to a collectively financed unemployment fund, limits
moral hazard in contexts where government authorities do not have the capacity to prevent abuse.

minimize, thereby severely detracting from their purported advantages.

Box 3.2  Public employment programmes and their contribution to social protection
Public employment programmes (PEPs), a term used to describe any programme involving direct
employment creation by government, are often used as one component of national social protection strategies. Among a broad variety of PEPs, two specific forms stand out:
•	 Public works programmes (PWPs), which may offer cash payments or food for work. This more common
and traditional form is often adopted as a temporary response to specific shocks and crises, but may also
have a longer-term horizon.
•	 Employment guarantee schemes (EGSs) refer to long-term rights-based programmes in which some level
of entitlement to work is provided.
While PEPs can contribute to several development objectives, they are not able to serve all objectives to the
same extent at the same time. In practice, the policy design and implementation requires the prioritization
of one function over others, along the following lines:
•	 Employment function: emphasis on job creation in programmes that focus on the State as the employer
of last resort.
•	 Social protection function: emphasis on income security and transfers in cash or in kind.
•	 Labour-based investment function: emphasis on the quality and nature of infrastructure constructed or
services provided.
Where the main priority is not clearly defined, the monitoring and evaluation of a programme against its objectives will be hampered. It is therefore necessary to clearly define, separate and articulate the objectives
of a programme, and to link it effectively to other employment and social protection policies.
Employment guarantee schemes can contribute to building national social protection floors in several
respects. They can enhance income security for people of working age with no or insufficient earnings, by
providing income that is regular and predictable and is provided as an entitlement. They can also be used to
construct or improve infrastructure that enhances the supply of health, education and other public services.
However, these schemes do not address all needs, given that the central element of employment excludes
those who are not able to work, for whatever reason. Some PEPs (e.g. in Ethiopia and India) therefore
combine employment guarantee schemes with cash transfers for those who are permanently or temporarily
unable to work, or for whom work is not available.

Mauritius,16 Saudi Arabia17 and Viet Nam.18 While
these had been planned before the global crisis, their
timely implementation was very helpful in coping with
its repercussions. In each of these countries, the disbursement of unemployment benefits is closely linked
to the provision of employment services that support
jobseekers in finding a new job or acquiring new skills.
Other emerging economies have expanded coverage of their unemployment insurance schemes to cover
workers at the margins of the formal economy. The Brazilian unemployment insurance scheme now covers not
only waged workers, including domestic workers, but
also small-scale fishermen, workers rescued from forced
labour and workers in the Bolsa Qualificação (training scholarship) programme. In South Africa, domestic

workers were brought under the umbrella of unemployment insurance in 2003.
Employment guarantee schemes and other forms
of public employment programmes (see box 3.2) have
emerged as a further policy option to provide temporary
employment and a certain level of income security to
rural populations during lean seasons when many rural
workers are unemployed or underemployed. India’s
MGNREGS, introduced in 2005, provides a legally
guaranteed right to a maximum of 100 days of employment a year to rural households (see box 3.3). Many
other countries have been using public employment
programmes to provide poor people with some level of
income security at least for a limited period of time, although this is usually not based on a legal entitlement.

16  Mauritius complemented its unemployment assistance scheme with a social insurance scheme in 2009.
17  Saudi Arabia’s Hafiz programme, implemented in December 2011, provides financial assistance of up to 2,000 riyal (SAR) a month to
jobseekers and offers a broad range of placement and upskilling services.
18  Viet Nam introduced an employment insurance scheme in 2009, following the adoption of the Law on Social Insurance in 2006. The
scheme is now being converted into an Employment Insurance scheme, expanding the scope of employment promotion measures provided
in combination with cash benefits.

Box 3.3  India’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)
The MGNREGS was established under the corresponding Act (the National Rural Employment Guarantee
Act: NREGA), adopted in 2005. Reflecting the constitutional right to work, the scheme confers legal rights
on beneficiaries, which distinguishes it from programmes that are not anchored in national legislation and
are therefore prone to discretionary changes. There are, however, some concerns that poor, often illiterate,
households cannot realize their rights in practice.
Under the MGNREGS, a rural household is entitled to demand up to 100 days of employment per year,
which is made available on agreed public works sites. A share of places in this programme is reserved for
women. The programme undertakes projects facilitating land and water resource management, together with
infrastructure development projects such as road construction. The programme is designed to be self-targeting,
with wages equal to the prevailing, officially declared, minimum wage for agricultural labourers in the area. If
work is not provided within the stipulated time, the applicant is entitled to receive an unemployment allowance.
The allocation for the programme from the national budget for the financial year 2012/13 was equivalent to
0.3 per cent of GDP. The programme is acknowledged as one of the largest rights-based integrated employment
and social protection initiatives in the world, reaching close to 50 million rural households – ­approximately
30 per cent of rural households – in 2012.

While the possibility of using public employment
programmes to pursue simultaneously a multiplicity
of objectives (investment, employment and social protection) renders them an attractive tool, the concomitant lack of a clearly defined primary objective can limit
their effectiveness in fulfilling social protection objectives (e.g. ILO, 2014b; Lieuw-Kie-Song et al., 2011;
McCord, 2012; Subbarao et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
several countries (including Ethiopia and South Africa)
have taken deliberate steps to emphasize social protection objectives in their public employment programmes
(McCord, 2012). Public employment programmes will
only help to alleviate poverty in the long term if they
are designed to provide decent work, including an adequate level of wages, an integral skills development
component and full respect for the occupational safety
and health of workers, while also ensuring beneficiaries
are covered by existing social security schemes and provided with access to health care.
3.2.7 Unemployment benefits as a key
element of crisis response
and fiscal consolidation measures
During the recent global crisis, many countries benefited from the capacity of unemployment benefit
schemes to stabilize aggregate demand, and thus foster
quick recovery (ILO 2011a; IILS, 2011c), in line with
the Global Jobs Pact (ILO, 2009a; ECOSOC, 2009).

Countries that had unemployment benefit schemes in
place before the crisis were able to scale them up quickly
to enhance their power as automatic stabilizers. Where
partial unemployment benefits were available to compensate for crisis-induced reductions in working hours,
they helped workers to keep their jobs, and employers to
retain their workforces, during troughs in demand, and
supported a rapid response to the first signs of recovery
(ILO, 2011a; IILS, 2011c). A number of countries implemented these and other expansionary measures at a
relatively early stage of the financial crisis. As the crisis
continued and pressures on public budgets increased,
some of these expansionary measures gave way to fiscal
consolidation measures.19

Expansionary measures: Using unemployment
benefits to ensure income security
for the unemployed and to preserve
jobs for the employed
Extension of coverage and increase in the level and duration of benefit.  Several countries facilitated or extended access to existing or new unemployment benefits
in response to the global crisis (ILO and World Bank,
2012; Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012). Some countries,
such as Australia, reduced the waiting period for unemployment benefits; others, such as Latvia, reduced
the length of the period of contributions required to
be eligible for benefits. Most countries extended coverage to workers previously excluded, such as non-regular

Box 3.4  Keeping people in employment through part-time unemployment benefits:
The example of Germany
Germany’s part-time unemployment benefit (Kurzarbeitergeld or short-time work compensation), was one of
the country’s main policy instruments during the global financial and economic crisis. This benefit allowed
companies faced with a drop in demand to retain workers on shorter working hours while guaranteeing
them at least a degree of income security. Partial compensation for their loss in direct earnings was made
through a cash benefit paid for a maximum period of six months. At the peak of the crisis, in May 2009,
these benefits were being paid to around 1.5 million workers (5.4 per cent of the workforce).
As a result, the sudden downturn of the economy led to only a moderate increase in the number of unemployed and the number of recipients of unemployment insurance benefits, the employment impact of the
downturn being largely cushioned by the remarkable expansion of partial unemployment benefits.
This policy is considered to be one of the factors explaining the relatively quick recovery of the German
economy, because it ensured that employers were in a position to retain their workers throughout the crisis,
thus avoiding firing and rehiring costs, and were able to respond quickly as the markets picked up again. The
average reduction in working time was 30.5 per cent, the equivalent of about 432,000 full-time jobs. A loss of
jobs of this magnitude would have resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate of about 1 percentage point.

workers in Germany and Japan, the self-employed in
Austria, and young people in Argentina (Bonnet, Saget
and Weber, 2012). Other countries extended the duration of coverage to ensure inclusion of those who
would otherwise be deemed to have exhausted their
rights (these included Argentina, Brazil,20 Japan,21
Latvia,22 Spain23 and, in the case of older workers, Uruguay24), or provided emergency benefits to this group
(for example, the United States25). Another strategy followed by some countries (for example, India and South
Africa)was to use public employment programmes as
a means to ensure a predictable income stream for unemployed and underemployed workers. Finally, some
countries (for example, France and the United Kingdom) increased the level of benefits or provided oneoff benefit payments to some categories of unemployed
workers.
Keeping people in employment.  Several countries
(including Canada,26 France, Germany (see box 3.4),

the Netherlands and Poland) used partial unemployment benefits to allow employers to retain workers
during the trough in demand. Various social dialogue
instruments, especially tripartite cooperation and collective bargaining, were used to shape these policies.
Partial unemployment benefits helped not only to contain the rise in unemployment and the number of recipients of (full) unemployment benefits, but also to
keep experienced workers in place so that their employers could take prompt advantage of the eventual upturn
(see Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012; ILO, 2010a
(pp. 106–111); ILO, 2011a; Arpaia et al., 2010). Such
measures are widely considered to have been successful
in fostering quick economic recovery and preventing
the “­ dequalification” and discouragement of workers.
Other countries (for example, China) introduced or extended programmes that aimed at upgrading the skills
of employed workers and workers in vulnerable situations (Aleksynska et al., 2013).

20  In 2009, a temporary increase was implemented in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits for sectors hit particularly badly by
the recession. This extension reached around 103,000 people, or 20 per cent of those receiving unemployment benefits. Also, those lacking
formal income-earning opportunities have been targeted through extended access to the Bolsa Família programme. The stabilization of
aggregate consumption through this measure, together with other social security programmes and the minimum wage policy, is observed to
have contributed substantially to accelerating recovery in Brazil (IILS, 2011b.)
21  At the end of 2008, Japan adopted a 60-day extension of the period during which unemployment benefits were payable to those who
faced difficulty in finding re-employment (taking into consideration place of residence and age).
22  The duration of unemployment benefit payment in Latvia was temporarily increased (from 1 July 2009 to 31 December 2011) to nine
months across the board.
23  This provision, introduced in Spain at the end of 2009 and extended in 2010, was complemented by measures to promote employability
of the long-term unemployed involving their active participation.
24  Introduced in 2009: see Amarante, Arim and Dean, 2013.
25  The extension of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) in the United States began in June 2008 and expired on 1 January 2014.
26  Canada’s Work Sharing programme aimed at avoiding lay-offs by offering benefits from employment insurance to qualifying workers
willing to work reduced hours while their employer recovers from adverse economic conditions.

Contraction measures: Tightening entitlement
conditions for jobseekers’ access to benefits

42

While many countries took bold measures to expand
unemployment benefit coverage in order to mitigate the
effect of the crisis, others adopted fiscal consolidation
measures even in the early stages of the global crisis.
These included the tightening of entitlement conditions
for unemployment benefits (for example, in Ireland,
Ukraine and the United Kingdom), increases in the
number of contribution payments required to qualify
for the receipt of unemployment benefits (in Ireland
and Switzerland), the introduction of a higher earnings
threshold for eligibility (in Ireland), reductions in the
maximum period for which benefits could be paid (in
the Czech Republic, Portugal, Serbia and Switzerland),
and reductions in the level of benefits (in Romania and
Serbia) (see Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012). While
such measures may have helped to contain the rising
cost of unemployment benefits, they may have led conversely to an increase in expenditure on social assistance
benefits. Reductions in the maximum duration of entitlements (as in the Czech Republic and Ireland) or
in the level of benefits (in Hungary and Latvia) had a
strong impact on both current recipients of unemployment benefits and the newly unemployed.
Inevitably, the rise in unemployment rates led to a
steep increase in the number of recipients of unemployment benefits, which rose on average by some 50 per
cent between January 2008 and early 2009. In several

countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the
United States, the number of beneficiaries had roughly
doubled by 2009 compared to pre-crisis levels. Since
then, the number of beneficiaries has decreased, yet
in most countries it still remains well above the levels
of 2008. Considering the dim prospects for a global
employment recovery (IMF, 2013a; ILO, 2014a), this
situation is likely to continue. The expansion of unemployment benefits in some countries, together with
the rising numbers of beneficiaries, have led inevitably
to an increase in expenditure on such schemes. In some
countries the existing reserves in unemployment insurance funds have been exhausted, necessitating budget
allocations for tax-financed benefits.
As a consequence, from 2010–11 more countries
started implementing fiscal consolidation measures
with the objective of redressing the financial situation
of both unemployment insurance funds and public
budgets. This included some countries (such as S­ lovenia
and Spain) which had taken bold measures to expand
unemployment benefits at the onset of the crisis, but
now felt the need to withdraw some of these expansionary measures and curtail unemployment benefits
(see box 3.5).
Several countries implemented measures which
changed the rights and obligations of jobseekers with
regard to accessing benefits. For example, Canada,
Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States
all strengthened the requirements of unemployment
benefit recipients in respect of searching for work.

Box 3.5  From expansion to fiscal consolidation:
The examples of Slovenia and Spain
In several countries, an initial expansion of unemployment benefits in response to the global crisis was later
reversed with the objective of consolidating public finances.
In January 2011, the Slovenian government introduced the new Labour Market Regulation Act (LMRA)
as a response to the economic crisis, aiming thereby “to increase the security of jobseekers, especially
the security of unemployed persons and persons whose employment is at risk, through the government’s
quicker response in the labour market”. However, measures adopted in 2013 as part of a Bill on Emergency Measures, temporarily reduced the levels of unemployment cash benefits and maternity benefits for
budgetary reasons. Unemployment cash benefits were reduced by 3 per cent to a monthly level no lower
than €350 but no higher than €890 (the previous ceiling was €1,050). In addition, instead of unemployment
benefits the long-term unemployed would receive wages and reimbursement of employment-related costs in
exchange for their participation in public employment programmes.
In the early phase of the crisis, the Spanish government decided to extend unemployment protection temporarily to those who had exhausted their eligibility to benefits and subsidies and were in need, due to lack
of other income, with an allowance of €420 per month for a maximum period of six months in combination
with measures to promote employability. More recently, various measures have been taken with a view to
reducing expenditure, including lowering the level of contributory unemployment benefits after six months,
increasing the minimum age of qualification for non-contributory unemployment benefits for the older
unemployed, and introducing new requirements for the long-term unemployed and persons with disabilities
with regard to the acceptance of offers of employment or training.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Measures to this end included a broader definition of
suitable employment and stricter obligations for jobseekers with regard to their efforts in actively looking
for a new job (e.g. in Canada27), compulsory participation in training and other active labour market programmes for certain categories of the unemployed (e.g.
in Brazil,28 Saudi Arabia,29 Spain, the United Kingdom,
the United States and Uruguay30) and stricter sanctions
for recipients who refuse an offer of suitable employment (e.g. Ireland31 and New Zealand32), as well as
measures to enhance the effectiveness of employment
services in getting people into employment and shortening the duration of unemployment claims (e.g. the
United States33).
The role of unemployment benefits during the
global crisis has highlighted two major policy lessons.
First, it has underscored the importance of having welldesigned unemployment benefit schemes in place which
not only support the structural transformation of the
economy in “normal” times, but can also be quickly
scaled up in the event of major economic shocks in
order to realize their full potential as automatic stabilizers of aggregate demand. Second, unemployment
benefit schemes can achieve their potential only if they
are financed appropriately from contributions and general taxation. Where financing is insufficient, ill-timed
and ill-designed curtailments of benefits may have
pro-cyclical effects, which may thwart economic recovery and lead to substantial increases in poverty and
vulnerability.

3.2.8 Renewed emphasis on (re-)integrating
unemployed workers into the labour market
Some of the measures recently implemented aimed at
(re-)integrating unemployed workers into the labour
market, accelerating a trend that started well before
the global crisis (e.g. Lødemel and Trickey, 2001; Eichhorst, Kaufmann and Konle-Seidl, 2008). Some have
been adopted as part of the crisis response, while others
are not directly related to it. Aiming at better linking “active” and “passive” labour market policies, some
measures focus on encouraging unemployed workers
to participate in training, job matching and subsidized
employment programmes, while others are more coercive in character.
Many of the recent reforms have been aimed at promoting and facilitating (re-)entry into employment
for various specific groups, including the long-term
unemployed, youth, single parents and persons with
disabilities. Since 2010, most measures adopted in developed countries in particular have aimed at reducing
unemployment by providing better support to the unemployed to enter or re-enter employment and by stimulating job creation. This is the case, for example, of
measures introduced in pursuit of the objectives of the
European Commission’s “Social Investment Package”
(SIP) (European Commission, 2013a). In recent years,
too, wage and job subsidies and credit provision have
been initiated to encourage job creation in many countries, e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Russian
Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United
States.

27  Changes introduced in the Canadian legal framework governing the employment insurance scheme included a clarification of the
definition of “suitable employment” and of what constitutes a “reasonable job search” by those claiming unemployment benefits. The new
definition of suitable employment widened the range of jobs that some beneficiaries (those with frequent unemployment spells) are required to
accept, including jobs unrelated to previous fields of work, jobs paying 70 per cent of their former earnings and jobs entailing long commutes.
28  In Brazil, additional vocational training opportunities were created for beneficiaries of income transfer programmes, including those
receiving unemployment benefits and transfers under the Bolsa Família programme.
29  In Saudi Arabia, a series of measures targeted the recipients of Hafiz: these included referral of hard-to-place beneficiaries to job
placement centres, compulsory training, establishment of partnerships with private sector enterprises to provide training and employment
opportunities for beneficiaries, and strengthened employment services (ILO and World Bank, 2012).
30  In Uruguay, increases in the amounts of benefit and the extension of duration of payment from six to eight months were accompanied by
a new obligation to take training courses.
31  In Ireland, the conditionality of benefits was changed in the extended social welfare legislation that took effect from January 2011,
stipulating disqualification for receipt of certain benefits (or reductions in payments) when a person refuses an offer of suitable employment
or refuses to participate in an appropriate course of training or other support programme. Prior to this, the legislation required only that
a recipient be seeking a job and be available for work, a provision that was applied in a somewhat benign manner (European Commission,
2012b).
32  From July 2013, unemployed people in New Zealand have to comply with new conditions for the payment of benefits. If a suitable job
is turned down without good reason, benefits may be reduced by half for unemployed with dependent children and for others stopped
for 13 weeks. Other conditions include accepting (and passing) drug tests when applying for a job in certain sectors such as truck driving,
construction and forestry; giving advance notice if leaving the country; and, for unemployed with children, meeting conditions with regard
to children’s school attendance and parents’ childcare obligations.
33  A reform of the Re-employment Services (RES) and Re-employment and Eligibility Assessments (REA) programmes aimed at ensuring
more rapid re-employment, shorter claim durations and fewer erroneous payments of unemployment compensation.

Box 3.6  Measures facilitating return to work for parents with young children
Several countries have taken measures to help parents (particularly mothers) with young children return to work.
In Australia, a set of policy measures aimed at facilitating the (re-)entry into the labour market of single
parents include more generous earnings disregards under various income support benefits, career counselling and enhanced childcare provision.
In Japan, a programme which supports women looking for work while raising their children, for instance
through offering childcare services and information services, was re-invigorated. In 2011, 69,000 women
used the programme and successfully found jobs.
In Pakistan, in 2009, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was introduced. The programme
supports women in poor households with a combined package of cash benefits (1,000 Pakistan rupees
(PKR) per month: approximately US$12) and in-kind social services. In addition to extending health insurance coverage to its beneficiaries (Waseela-e-Sehat), the programme provides vocational training opportunities (Waseela-e-Rozgar) to every beneficiary and access to interest-free financial support (Waseela-e-Haq)
for certain women receiving the monthly benefit. The BISP is now being implemented across the whole
country, with special attention to remote areas.
In the Russian Federation, access to training programmes designed for jobseekers was extended to women
on leave to care for a child under the age of three. In 2011, 26,200 women on leave benefited from these
programmes, of whom 15,700 found jobs. Additional measures included the introduction of flexible forms of
work, self-employment programmes for women, and pre-school education for children aged three to seven.

44
Many of these measures focus on linking the disbursement of cash benefits to active labour market policies, such as programmes for the provision of training,
skills development, better job-matching, or career guidance and mentorship. These include efforts to provide
jobseekers and recipients of unemployment benefits
with better access to training, retraining, certification
and job-matching (e.g. in the Russian Federation34 and
Saudi Arabia), personalized support (e.g. in the United
Kingdom35), training and subsidized employment opportunities (e.g. Saudi Arabia36), and support in complying with job-search and activity requirements (Spain),

as well as specific measures to support young people
(e.g. in Argentina), older workers (e.g. in Canada37) and
other specific groups (e.g. in the United States38). In
some countries (including Japan, Pakistan, and the Russian Federation), measures to facilitate the employment
of parents, particularly women, with young children
have been introduced (see box 3.6).
Such policies have often been linked to broader
efforts to provide an integrated package of “active”
and “passive” labour market policies, or, more broadly,
to offer integrated employment and social protection
services (e.g. in Argentina,39 Brazil and Germany40).

34  A programme was initiated in the Russian Federation in 2010 to provide jobseekers with professional training, retraining, advanced
training and certification.
35  The United Kingdom’s Work Programme offers personalized support to jobseekers through public, private or voluntary sector providers,
who are paid on the basis of employment and job retention results.
36  In Saudi Arabia, vocational training opportunities, specialized training and on-the-job training are provided through partnerships with
private employers.
37  Canada’s Targeted Initiative for Older Workers helps unemployed older workers from small and vulnerable communities to upgrade their
skills in order to go back to work.
38  The Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP) supports military veterans in getting back to work by supplying up to 12 months
of training programmes.
39  The Argentinian Ministry of Employment and Labour implements several income transfers and support programmes to address the
risks and consequences associated with unemployment and underemployment. The overall set of policies provides responses targeted at the
specific needs of different groups. The contributory unemployment insurance programme (Seguro de Desempleo) provides some income
compensation for formal employees who lose their jobs. As a complement, for formal employment, the programme for productive recovery
(Programa de Recuperación Productiva) supports enterprises finding it difficult to retain jobs. In addition, for those not covered by the
unemployment insurance programme and those who have exhausted their entitlement to benefits, the training and employment insurance
scheme (Seguro de Capacitación y Empleo) provides vocational training and counselling through municipal employment offices. Also, the
Interzafra programme facilitates transition between temporary or seasonal contracts by supporting workers with a cash allowance. Finally,
the programme for more and better work for young people (Programa Jóvenes Más y Mejor Trabajo) aims at promoting social and labour
market inclusion for young people through cash transfers, job counselling and educational support.
40  The so-called “Hartz reforms” in Germany, particularly the unifying of unemployment assistance with social assistance in 2005 for
those beneficiaries who are deemed employable, aimed at providing an integrated set of benefits and services for jobseekers and enhancing
employability for recipients of social assistance (see, e.g., Alber and Heisig, 2011; Clasen and Goerne, 2011).

Contents

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

These integrated packages are aimed not only at recipients of unemployment benefits, but also at bringing recipients of other types of social assistance benefits
under a common umbrella of activation policies (Clasen
and Clegg, 2011). For example, Germany and France
have implemented measures to combine unemployment
benefits with social assistance for employable beneficiaries, and to merge their administration with employment
services into “one-stop shops”, with a stronger emphasis
on decentralized services based on individualized “inclusion contracts”.41 Such policies are particularly relevant
in the context of high levels of long-term unemployment, taking into account that discouraged workers may
cease to be registered with employment services.
While such measures are intended to provide an integrated package of support to individuals, combining
cash benefits with employment services, skills development and psycho-social support where necessary, some
concerns have been expressed that individualized inclusion contracts may weaken social rights, if they lead to
legal frameworks not being applied in a homogeneous
manner (Künzel, 2011).
Also, while participation in training, retraining and
other similar measures is intended to facilitate a quicker
return to employment, an expectation or requirement
to participate can also mean stricter control in the provision of benefits and additional obligations for jobseekers with regard to their entitlements to benefits. These
measures may lead to the exclusion of, or discrimination against, certain groups of beneficiaries and the
restriction of effective access to benefits. Careful design
and implementation of activation measures is therefore necessary to ensure that these do not lead to un­
intended effects.
3.2.9 Challenges
As highlighted in this section, unemployment protection plays a multiple role in guaranteeing income security for unemployed workers while also supporting
the structural transformation of national economies and
mitigating demand shocks. One of the lessons learned
from the global crisis is the importance of having
effective unemployment benefit systems in place prior to
a crisis in order to ensure that these are fully functional
as automatic stabilizers of aggregate demand in the event

of an economic downturn. However, a large number of
countries lack effective unemployment benefit schemes
and many others have schemes that provide only limited
coverage. Consequently, the potential of such schemes
to address employment shocks, as well as to support economic change, remains largely unfulfilled. In view of
this, it is all the more encouraging that unemployment
protection schemes have been recently introduced in
several emerging economies, and that other countries are
considering similar reforms. At the same time, increased
efforts are needed to introduce measures, where possible,
to enhance the effectiveness of existing schemes and to
strengthen their links with programmes that support
entry or re-entry into employment, skills upgrading and
other active labour market policies.
In order to improve protection in countries with
a high proportion of informal employment, which is
usually accompanied by large-scale structural under­
employment, it may be necessary to combine a variety of
measures. These may include unemployment insurance
alongside employment guarantee schemes and social
assistance or other cash transfer programmes, depending on national context, which together can form an
effective social protection floor for unemployed workers
and their families, in accordance with Recommendation No. 202.
Unemployment benefits have not functioned
alone in protecting incomes, promoting employment
and enabling a quick recovery during the global crisis.
Measures taken to strengthen other social security
benefits, such as pensions, sickness benefits, social assistance benefits and access to health care, also play an
important role in softening the impact of the crisis on
private households and economies alike.
Coordination of unemployment protection with
other social security policy areas is thus essential, as is
coordination with employment and employment-related services. In order to be fully effective in supporting
economic change and responses to shocks, unemployment benefits need to be complemented by training, retraining and other active labour market policies. These
opportunities should be available to recipients of unemployment benefits as well as to non-recipients, and to
all workers, whether in formal employment or operating
in the informal economy. Effective coordination with
such employment policies will enable unemployment
benefits to fulfil their role in the most efficient way.

41  In Germany, since the reforms of 2005 (see note 40), the administration of these cash benefits is combined with employment services in job
centres. Social assistance is now limited to those who are not employable, and is administered separately. In France, an active inclusion policy is
followed through the Revenu de Solidarité Active (2009), whose administration and linkage with employment services is highly decentralized.

3.3 Employment injury protection
KEY MESSAGES
nn Worldwide, only 33.9 per cent of the labour
force is covered by law for employment
injury through mandatory social insurance.
If voluntary social insurance coverage and
employer liability provisions are included,
39.4 per cent of the labour force is covered
by law.
nn In practice, actual access to employment
injury protection is even lower, largely owing
to incomplete enforcement of the legislation
in many countries.

46

nn The low coverage of employment injury
compensation in many low- and middleincome countries points to an urgent need
to enhance working conditions in respect of
occupational safety and health, as well as
improving employment injury coverage for
all workers, including those in the informal
economy.
nn As more countries move from employer
liability as the basis for employment injury
protection to a mechanism based on social
insurance, levels of protection for workers
are likely to improve – but only if new laws
are effectively enforced.

3.3.1 Protecting workers affected
by employment injury
Employment injury benefit schemes, providing benefits
in cash and in kind in cases of work-related accidents
and occupational disease, constitute in many countries the oldest branch of social security. These schemes
were established to address one of the key challenges in
modern workplaces. As a corollary of their responsibility to ensure working conditions which secure the occupational safety and health of their workers, employers
are responsible for ensuring fair, equitable and effective
compensation of workers (and, in the event of death, of
their survivors) for the loss of income suffered as a consequence of an accident or occupational disease and for
their access to the necessary health care (covering medical and allied care services and goods, including rehabilitation). Where such mechanisms are not in place, the
only hope of redress for a person injured at work, or for
her or his survivors, lies in action against the employer

in the ordinary courts. Lawsuits of this type are generally lengthy, expensive and stressful for victims, and
thus are rarely efficient in providing effective compensation to injured workers and the family or other dependants of deceased workers.
Non-adversarial schemes were thus introduced in
a number of countries at an early stage, with a view
to ensuring the timely provision of benefits to injured
workers and their dependants, the establishment of predictable and sustainable financing mechanisms, and
the efficient administration of funds. The first generation of such schemes consisted in “workmen’s compensation schemes”, under which the compensation of a
worker or his/her surviving family dependants is a legal
liability placed upon the employer. Underpinning this
approach is the principle that employers must provide
their workers with a safe and healthy working environment, and that failure to do so renders them liable for
the consequent losses suffered by workers or their family
members. Given that the financial burden of meeting
this obligation rests solely on employers, these schemes
often require them to take out private insurance. Experience has shown, however, that even where such an
obligation exists in law, the outcomes of these schemes
are often sub-optimal. The need to process an insurance claim, involving the need to obtain relevant information and undergo rigorous medical assessments, can
cause serious delays in obtaining treatment and benefits.
In addition, an employer may be reluctant to make a
claim for fear of other legal implications. In recognition
of these drawbacks, many countries have replaced employer liability provisions with social insurance, which
in effect extends the no-fault principle to share the costs
of employment injury across society (or at least that part
represented in the formal labour market) as a whole.
This shift in approach to employment injury protection has been reflected in the standards adopted by the
ILO from its early days (see box 3.7).
The effectiveness of programmes in addressing the
specific contingency of employment injury relies on a
specific set of principles:
1.	 “no fault”: a worker who is injured, or his/her
survivor(s) in case of death, should qualify for benefits without any necessity to prove “fault” on behalf
of the employer;
2.	 collective sharing of liability; and
3.	 neutral governance at some specified level of administration of the scheme, meaning that the right to
benefit can be established outside the contractual relationship between a worker and her or his employer.

Box 3.7  International standards relevant for employment injury protection
The right to protection against employment injury is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(UDHR), 1948, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966.
The realization of this right requires the application of safe and healthy working conditions, the prevention,
treatment and control of occupational diseases, and the provision of adequate benefits, in cash or in kind,
that ensure access to adequate health care and income security to victims of employment injury and their
dependent family members.1
Protection from employment injury has been the object of a number of Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO from its early days. According to Convention No. 102 (Part VI), any condition that
impacts negatively on health and which is due to a work accident or an occupational disease, and the
incapacity to work and earn that results from it, whether temporary or permanent, total or partial, must be
covered. The protection also includes, where a worker dies as a consequence of an employment injury or
occupational disease, the loss of support suffered by her or his dependants. Accordingly, the provision must
include medical and allied care, with a view to maintaining, restoring or improving the health of the injured
person and her or his ability to work and attend to personal needs. A cash benefit must also be paid to the
injured person or his/her dependants, as the case may be, at a guaranteed level and on a periodic basis,
serving an income replacement or support function. Where the disability is slight, the benefit can, under
certain conditions, be paid as a lump sum.
The Employment Injury Benefits Convention, 1964 (No. 121), and its accompanying Recommendation,
No. 121, set higher standards, mainly in terms of population coverage and level of benefits to be provided
(see Annex III). Convention No. 121 also recognizes the importance of an integrated approach for improving
working conditions, limiting the impact of employment injuries and facilitating the reintegration of persons
with disabilities in the labour market and in society; for such purposes this Convention requires the State
to take measures to prevent employment injuries, provide rehabilitation services and ensure that displaced
workers find suitable re-employment.
The approach taken by Recommendation No. 202 is different, reflecting its focus on preventing or alleviating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion through income security guarantees, rather than on specific
life risks; as such, it recognizes sickness and disability, in whatever cause or degree, as a potential source of
financial insecurity which should be addressed, in so far as it prevents people of working age from earning
sufficient income. In the same way, Recommendation No. 202 calls for guaranteed access to at least essential health care for all in need, over the life cycle, irrespective of the origin of the disability or ill health
for which such care is required. Basic income security and access to essential health care can be ensured
through a variety of approaches, combining contributory and non-contributory schemes and different types
of benefits, such as disability and employment injury benefits, as well as other social benefits, in cash or
in kind. Particularly relevant to employment injury protection is the Recommendation’s further call for the
combination of preventative, promotional and active measures with benefits and social services, and the
coordination of social protection policies with policies that promote, among other things, secure work within
a decent work framework.
1
UDHR, Article 25(1), ICESCR, Art. 7 (b), 12 (b) and (c). See also ICESCR, General Comment No. 19, “The right to social
security” (Art. 9), paras 2 and 16(e).

Within this framework, the aim of employment
injury provisions in most countries is to meet the needs
of workers who are incapacitated by injury at work
or occupational disease, or of their dependent family
members, by way of:
•	 appropriate and relevant medical and allied care,
•	 income replacement, by way of periodic cash benefits, in case of disablement, which may be assessed as
–	 temporary or permanent,
–	 partial or total, and
•	 contingent benefits (periodic cash payments and
funeral grants) payable to survivors (widow/er, children or other dependent relatives, as the case may
be) in case of death.

Many national employment injury schemes have a
set of wider aims, such as the re-employment of injured
or sick workers, and the promotion and maintenance
of decent levels of safety and health in the workplace.
These objectives can only be achieved effectively if there
is a high level of policy integration, not only between
the various branches of social security schemes, but also
between those and policies relating to labour markets,
labour inspection and occupational safety and health
(OSH).
The provision of adequate compensation in case
of permanent partial disability represents one of the
greatest challenges in the employment injury branch
of social protection. An approach which focuses on the
loss of bodily function tends to compensate essentially

48

for the physiological loss and may result in either overor u­ nder-compensation from the economic point of
view, even if the degree of disability is not assessed exclusively on the basis of medical factors. An approach
based on earning capacity attempts to relate the level
of benefit to the economic loss arising from the injury;
this imposes demanding administrative requirements
for the management of claims, and needs to be complemented by well-developed rehabilitation services
in order to develop the residual capacities of injured
workers. This in turn requires the full engagement of
employers in the rehabilitation programme if it is to
succeed. To achieve it, a rating system considering the
past performance of employers in respect of occupational injury and disease can be used as an incentive to
encourage employers’ participation in facilitating the
return to work of injured workers, but this is possible
only in medium and large firms.
When it comes to implementation, another important criterion for measuring the effectiveness of
employment injury schemes is the ability of the system
to ensure that injured workers have access to the healthcare facilities, goods and services they need, and that

cash benefits reach injured workers or their survivors
without delay. The timely delivery of benefits requires
the setting-up of effective reporting systems and accompanying measures to assist victims and their survivors
in accessing employment injury insurance through
simple and efficient claims procedures. Online reporting systems of occupational accidents and diseases are
among the tools that can be used to facilitate access.
3.3.2 Types of employment injury
protection schemes
The majority of countries have adopted a social insurance approach to employment injury, though some
countries have retained some elements of the employer
liability approach. This may facilitate the coverage of
workers who are not compulsorily included in such
schemes, but who may wish to participate on a voluntary basis. In a very few countries, most notably the
Netherlands, employment injury coverage has been
fully integrated with schemes providing coverage for
non-work-related disabilities.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Figure  3.12 illustrates the patterns of coverage
worldwide. It can be seen that the emphasis on social
insurance, as opposed to first-generation schemes operating under employer’s liability, is strongest in Europe,
Central Asia and the Middle East, and lower in the
Americas, Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. In the latter
regions, employer liability provisions are still in place in
a number of countries.
3.3.3 Extent of legal coverage

Gender differences in legal coverage for employment injury are particularly high in the Middle East
and Africa, where the coverage rates for women are respectively 18 and 13 percentage points lower than the
overall coverage rates. In Latin American countries,
the major gender difference is in access to social insurance, which reflects to a large degree the over-representation of women in various types of occupation that
are usually excluded from legal coverage, ranging from
unpaid family work to self-employment.
Contents

Legal coverage for employment injury protects mostly
those in formal employment, whereas workers in informal employment are rarely covered. Figure 3.13 summarizes worldwide coverage and regional variations. At
the global level, only 33.4 per cent of the total labour
force, and only 31.7 per cent of the female labour force,
is mandatorily covered by law through social insurance.
When voluntary social insurance coverage and employer
liability provisions are included, 39.6 per cent of the
labour force is covered by law (36.7 per cent of the female
labour force); effective coverage rates, however, may be
significantly lower (see below). Not surprisingly, legal
coverage rates reflect the general pattern of social protection coverage, with high levels in Europe (both Western and Eastern) and North America, more moderate
but still substantial levels in Latin America, and much
lower levels in sub-Saharan Africa and most of Asia.

3.3.4 Extent of effective coverage
Legal coverage does not necessarily translate into
effective coverage, for a variety of reasons; indeed, as
figure 3.14 shows, the two diverge widely in many countries. In most countries for which data are available, the
number of contributors (in most cases employers contribute on behalf of their employees) lags behind the
number of those covered by law. The figure highlights
in particular a small group of countries which, on a theoretical basis, reach high levels of coverage, but on the
basis of voluntary participation (a principle adopted in
particular to promote scheme access for self-employed
workers). This is most striking in the cases of Indonesia
and the United Republic of Tanzania, where legal coverage ratios, including voluntary coverage, stand at well
above 70 per cent of the labour force, but where less than

10 per cent of the labour force is effectively covered in
practice. It is in fact not uncommon for voluntary coverage to be taken up by a fraction of those eligible under
the law. Possible reasons for this low take-up include low
contributory capacities in the population covered, a lack
of understanding of the importance of coverage, a mismatch between benefits offered and needs experienced,
or overly complex procedures that deter participation.
3.3.5 Adequacy of benefits
to cover workers’ needs
Employment injury benefits for permanent disability
are usually provided in the form of pensions. Schemes
vary widely in the proportion of pre-disablement
income provided (the replacement rate), as shown in
figure 3.15. The same applies to temporary incapacity,
as shown in figure 3.16, with further variation in the
duration of the benefit.
The provision of suitable employment opportunities
for workers disabled as the result of an employment
injury is important.42 China provides an interesting example. For certain degrees of disability, the employer
must provide suitable employment or pay a pension
equal to 60 per cent or more of the monthly net income
of the injured worker.

3.3.6 Recent developments
From a global perspective, it is striking that while
employment injury systems of some kind have been put
in place in most countries, many low-income countries
continue to rely on the principle of employer’s liability
rather than social insurance. It is, moreover, questionable whether countries with weak systems of enforcement and supervision have the capacity to monitor and
ensure compliance with the law. In addition, workers’
needs for effective protection in the event of employment injury are inadequately addressed in contexts
where informality of employment prevails.
In this context, it is germane to note the implications of the accident which occurred at Rana Plaza in
Dhaka, Bangladesh, in April 2013. Over 1,000 workers
in industrial units located in the building lost their lives
when it collapsed, and some 2,500 were injured (for
more details, see box 3.8). It has been all too clear in
the aftermath of this event that – among a host of interlinked issues of concern in respect of occupational
health and safety, social protection and labour market
conditions – the toll of human suffering is being compounded as a result of the lack of an effective scheme of
employment injury protection. Recently, many countries have been developing and implementing national
occupational safety and health programmes in line with

42  This observation has similar aspects to the discussion of employment opportunities for older workers at the International Labour
Conference in 2013 (ILO, 2013i).

the ILO’s Promotional Framework for Occupational
Safety and Health Convention, 2006 (No. 187). These
programmes can include employment injury insurance,
strengthened reporting systems for occupational accidents and diseases, and mechanisms for timely compensation, and preventive measures.
The transition from employer’s liability provisions
to social insurance-based employment injury schemes,
and the establishment of such schemes in countries
which previously had no protection mechanism, constitutes a significant improvement in the social security of
workers. In Cambodia, the employment injury scheme
introduced in 2009 as the first branch of the social insurance scheme covered 1,800 enterprises and more
than 500,000 workers (representing close to 20 per cent
of employees, most of them women) by the end of 2010
(GIZ, ILO and P4H, 2012).
Another trend in recent years has been a stronger
focus on enabling a faster return to work for beneficiaries. In a number of countries reforms were introduced
to strengthen provisions for rehabilitation, among other
measures (ISSA, 2012; OECD, 2010b; OECD, 2012a).
While in some countries such measures were adopted
with the objective of promoting rapid re-integration
into working life, often requiring substantial additional
upfront investments, in others such measures were
taken with a clear cost-saving motive, often with ambivalent effects on the situation of beneficiaries.

3.3.7 Challenges
Employment injury coverage interacts with coverage
in other areas of social security, such as health care.
Nevertheless, the health-care needs of victims of occupational injury or disease may go beyond or differ from
those of the majority of the people protected under
general health-care schemes: for instance, the treatment of certain occupational diseases may require specific types of specialist care. It is therefore important to
ensure that possible gaps are addressed. In this light, it
is a matter of concern that, even within Europe, there
are a number of countries where fiscal consolidation
measures have entailed severe cutbacks in health care
(see Chapter 5).
The financial needs addressed by employment injury
schemes are similar to those of persons with disabilities incurred outside work. Contributory disability
schemes which cover loss of earning capacity due to
non-work-related disablements usually require the completion of a qualifying period before the person covered
becomes entitled to a benefit. This requirement serves
as a safeguard against abuse, and allows the proper financing of schemes to ensure the due payment of disability benefits on a long-term basis. By contrast, the
qualifying conditions of employment injury benefit
schemes should be designed in such a way that workers
are protected against the consequences of employment

Box 3.8  The Rana Plaza disaster and its implications
for social security in cases of employment injury

52

On 24 April 2013, the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which housed five garment factories,
collapsed, killing at least 1,132 people and injuring more than 2,500. Only five months earlier, at least
112 workers had lost their lives in another tragic accident, trapped inside the burning Tazreen Fashions factory on the outskirts of Dhaka. These disasters, among the worst industrial accidents on record, awoke the
world to the poor labour conditions faced by workers in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh. For
some of the lowest wages of the world, millions of people, most of them girls and women, are exposed every
day to an unsafe work environment with a high incidence of work-related accidents and deaths, as well as
occupational diseases. Most of the factories do not meet standards required by building and construction
legislation. As a result, deaths from fire incidents and building collapses are frequent. In the absence of
a well-functioning labour inspection system and of appropriate enforcement mechanisms, decent work
and life in dignity are still far from reality for the vast majority of workers in the garment industry and their
families.
Given the hazardous working conditions and the high risk of exposure to employment injury in this sector,
the provision of adequate benefits is of critical importance to compensate injured workers for the loss of
earnings they are likely to suffer, and to ensure that they have access to the medical and associated care
required by their condition. Access to some form of financial compensation or support for dependent family
members who lose their breadwinner can also make the difference between life in dire poverty, where children and older people are forced to work to survive, and life at or just above subsistence level. At present,
the only form of financial protection available to workers and their dependants is set out in the labour code,
which requires employers, when liable, to provide specified payments to injured workers or survivors.
A recent amendment to the labour code requires employers to insure themselves against liability, but no
such obligation was in force at the time Tazreen caught fire, or when Rana Plaza collapsed. The amounts of
compensation envisaged are also very low and take the form of lump sums, offering inadequate protection
to beneficiaries against ill health and poverty in the medium and long term. The system is also plagued with
major practical application issues (e.g. evasion, lack of proper enforcement, absence of effective recourse),
with the result that legal entitlements very rarely materialize.
Despite the magnitude of the losses suffered by victims of the Tazreen and Rana Plaza accidents and
their survivors, no compensation was paid in application of the labour code provisions on employer liability.
A small number of global buyers and local players made some payments to victims in the months following
the disasters, albeit on a voluntary basis. To redress the situation more substantively and ensure that injured
workers and dependants of the deceased were effectively compensated, both financially and in respect of
medical and other relevant care, global and local stakeholders got together and agreed to an unprecedented
coordinated framework. With the ILO acting as a neutral chair, an “Arrangement” was adopted, providing a
single approach to compensation consistent with ILO standards, and more specifically with the Employment
Injury Benefits Convention, 1964 (No. 121).1
The Tazreen fire and the Rana Plaza accident prompted local authorities and other stakeholders to take
major steps to strengthen occupational safety and health, labour inspection services, and skills training
and rehabilitation services in the long term, with the support, notably, of the ILO and of global buyers. No
concrete action has been taken, however, to develop a sound and effective framework for the provision of
employment injury benefits, in line with ILO standards and Convention No. 121, that would apply beyond
these specific incidents. There is, nevertheless, hope for the future, as such a measure is included in the
National Tripartite Action Plan on Fire Safety for the Ready-Made Garment Sector adopted in May 2013.

injury from their first day at work, and do not bear the
health and financial risks of an unsafe or unhealthy
work environment.
Employment injury benefits in case of permanent
disability are long-term periodic payments, similar to
other pensions, hence the need for an integrated approach within national systems. Integration prevents
the duplication of benefits and enables the standardization of adjustment mechanisms to ensure that the purchasing power of benefits is maintained.

The global trend towards coverage under social insurance is encouraging. Such a framework helps to promote the rights- and solidarity-based perspective which
is essential to the long-term health of social protection
systems.
Complex issues may arise in the treatment of occupational diseases with long latency periods. While
determining the time of occurrence of a work accident
may not be problematic, determining the onset of an occupational disease may be more difficult. Many workers

Contents

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

are currently exposed to working conditions that may
or may not lead to the development of an occupational
disease over a long period of time. Such problems can be
even more difficult to manage in the circumstances of
developing countries where relevant regulations, relating for example to protective clothing and other safeguarding measures, may be poorly enforced.
In those countries which have put in place employment injury insurance and workers’ compensation
schemes to address these needs, it is important that the
schemes be administered on a fair and consistent basis.
Medical examinations, diagnostics and assessments must
be rigorous, and based on a national list of occupational
diseases. Such lists, however, may not always be seen as
sympathetic to claimants, and tend to reflect a particular
set of national or local conditions and perceptions.43

Providing protection in cases of employment injury
is an area of social security in which effective administration, and equitable treatment of claimants, plays a
particularly crucial role. The role of administrators may
be very wide, and closely interrelated with that of labour
inspectors responsible for checking workplace safety as
well as the whole range of measures to help prevent accidents at work, occupational injury and work-related
diseases. An integrated framework comprising comprehensive occupational safety and health measures, strong
inspection services and enforcement measures, as well
as adequate cash and health-care benefits in the event
of employment injury, accompanied by appropriate rehabilitation services, remains the best way to ensure
that workers and their family dependants are effectively
protected against the risks of employment injury.

3.4 Disability benefits44

KEY MESSAGES
nn Effective measures to support persons with disabilities in finding and retaining quality employment
are a key element of non-discriminatory and inclusive policies that help to realize their rights and
aspirations as productive members of society.
nn Complementing contributory schemes, non-contributory disability benefits play a key role in protecting
those persons with disabilities who have not (yet) earned entitlements to contributory schemes, in
particular those disabled from birth or before working age, and those who for any reason have not
had the opportunity to contribute to social insurance for long enough to be eligible for benefits.
nn Activation policies can play an important role in supporting persons with disabilities in finding suitable employment. They should be designed in such a way that they protect the rights of those who,
for various reasons, are not able to find suitable employment, and for whom the introduction of such
policies may result in a reduction of income security and potentially higher risk of poverty.
nn Policy reforms should therefore pay special attention to finding the right balance between supporting
engagement in employment and providing an adequate level of income security for persons with disabilities.

3.4.1 Protecting and enabling persons
with disabilities
According to global estimates, persons with disabilities
constitute some 15 per cent of the world’s population;
many of them live in developing countries. Around
785 million persons with disabilities are of working
age (15 years or over) (WHO and World Bank, 2011).
Many of them are engaged in the labour market, and

many of them face greater disadvantage than others
in accessing decent work that matches their skills and
qualifications. Compared to others, persons with disabilities are less likely to be in full-time employment,
more likely to find themselves in the informal economy
and among the ranks of the working poor, and more
likely to be unemployed and economically inactive
(OHCHR, 2012; UN, 2013a; ILO, 2013d). Some persons with disabilities may also find it difficult to obtain

43  As a result, statistics on employment injury benefits may reflect a considerably lower degree of cross-national comparability than is the
case for other areas covered in this report.
44  This section focuses on disability which arises outside employment and that is not the result of an employment injury. For an overview of
the state of the world’s social security coverage of disability resulting from employment injury, see section 3.3 above.

Box 3.9  Disability benefits for income protection: Relevant international standards

54

The international human rights legal framework contains many explicit references to the right to social protection of persons with disabilities. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, and the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, contain a general recognition of this right, while
the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) goes into more detail.1 Together, they
recognize the right of persons with disabilities to an adequate standard of living for themselves and their
families, including adequate food, clothing and housing, to the continuous improvement of living conditions, to social security and to the highest attainable standard of health. More specifically, according to
the CRPD, States must safeguard and promote the realization of their right to social protection without
discrimination on the basis of disability, providing equal access to appropriate and affordable services and
devices and other assistance with disability-related needs; social protection and poverty reduction programmes; assistance with disability-related expenses; public housing programmes; and retirement benefits
and programmes. The Convention also lays down the right of persons with disabilities to the enjoyment of
the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability. To this end, States
must take all appropriate measures to ensure access for persons with disabilities to health services that are
gender-sensitive, including health-related rehabilitation.
In a complementary way, successive standards adopted by the ILO set both basic minimum and higher
standards of income protection which should be guaranteed to persons with disabilities in replacement
of the income they were earning before disablement, or would have been earning from employment had
they been able to work. More specifically, Convention No. 102 (Part IX – Invalidity Benefit) deals with the
contingency of total disablement (not due to an employment injury) which results in a person’s inability to
engage in any gainful activity and which is likely to be permanent. In these circumstances, protection is
to be provided through periodic cash benefits, subject to certain conditions. The Invalidity, Old-Age and
Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), in its Part II, deals with the same subject matter but sets
higher standards for disability benefits schemes. Its accompanying Recommendation, No. 131, 2 broadens
the definition of the contingencies that should be covered under national schemes by including partial
disability, which should give rise to a reduced benefit, and by introducing the incapacity to engage in an
activity involving substantial gain among the criteria for disability assessments. Convention No. 128 also
requires the provision of rehabilitation services designed to enable persons with disabilities to either resume
their employment or perform another activity suited to their aptitudes.
Although medical care, including medical rehabilitation, is dealt with in separate provisions in Convention
No. 102 (Part II) and the Medical Care and Sickness Benefits, Convention, 1969 (No. 130) – discussed
at greater length in Chapter 5 – a comprehensive, coherent and integrated approach to disability benefits,
such as the one set forth in the ILO’s normative framework, requires that equal attention be given to the income support and medical needs of persons with disabilities. Hence, the standards set as regards the provision of medical care, including medical rehabilitation,3 are highly relevant; such care should be “afforded
with a view to maintaining, restoring or improving [their] health … and [their] ability to work and to attend
to [their] personal needs”.4 Convention No. 102 further requires the institution or government department
administering medical care to cooperate with the general vocational rehabilitation services “with a view to
the re-establishment of handicapped persons in suitable work” (Art. 35).
Recommendation No. 202 also puts forward an integrated and comprehensive approach to social protection and disability benefits, according to which persons with disabilities should enjoy the same guarantees
of basic income security and access to essential health care as other members of society through national
social protection floors. These guarantees can be provided through a variety of schemes (contributory and
non-contributory) and benefits (in cash or kind), as is most effective and efficient in meeting the needs and
circumstances of persons with disabilities to allow them to live in dignity. Some of the principles set out
in the Recommendation are of particular relevance for persons with disabilities, including the principles of
non-discrimination, gender equality and responsiveness to special needs, as well as respect for the rights
and dignity of people covered by the social security guarantees.

or hold down employment due to their impairments or
a non-supportive environment, or may be able to work
only to a limited extent because of their impairments,
and therefore have specific social protection needs.
Social protection systems play a key role in meeting the specific needs of persons with disabilities with
regard to income security, social health protection and

social inclusion. Elements of social security systems
that explicitly address disability-related needs include
schemes or programmes that provide income support
to persons with disabilities and their families (such as
contributory or non-contributory disability pensions,
other disability-related benefits and general social assist­
ance), social health protection and other mechanisms

Contents

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

to ensure universal health coverage.45 Schemes and programmes that support the (re-)integration of persons
with disabilities into the labour market and facilitate
their participation in employment also play a key role.
In this respect, financial support to cover the disabilityrelated costs associated with having a job can help persons with disabilities to avoid falling into poverty traps
and facilitate their participation in productive employment (OHCHR, 2012; UN, 2013a).
Almost all countries offer at least a basic level of protection for persons with disabilities, but do so within a
variety of frameworks. In general, schemes tend to distinguish between permanent and temporary disability,
and between different types and degrees of disability,
in recognition of the fact that people with different
kinds and duration of disability can have very different needs.46 This is so not only in terms of benefits to
provide for income and livelihoods, and of appropriate health care, but also in terms of rehabilitation, retraining and re-employment services. In respect of all of
these factors, and also in the very definitions adopted,
schemes designed in individual countries vary widely.
Employment injury benefits (see section 3.3 above)
are highly relevant for persons with employment-related disabilities who benefit from coverage (mainly
workers in the formal economy). For those who are not
covered by such provisions, or where these do not exist,
income security is largely dependent on general disability benefits. In line with international standards (see
box 3.9), such benefits should meet a number of criteria in order to produce the desired outcomes: schemes
should be designed to meet specific disability-related
needs; they should not prevent access to other social security benefits, unless serving the same function; benefits should be provided on a non-discriminatory basis;
and benefits should not act as a disincentive to seeking
employment.
3.4.2 Types of disability benefit schemes
Disability benefits may take various forms, depending
on the type and objectives of the scheme(s) in place in a
given country. In many countries, disability cash benefits are accompanied by benefits in kind, such as free and
adapted public transport, access to other public services
free of charge, free or subsidized ergonomic equipment,

etc. While these benefits in kind have a monetary value
and therefore contribute to guaranteeing income security, this section of the chapter focuses on cash benefits, which account for the majority of disability benefits.
Almost all countries have a scheme anchored in law
that provides cash benefits to persons with disabilities
(see figure 3.17). In a majority of countries (155) this is
done at least partly through social insurance schemes.
These mainly cover employees in the formal economy,
and generally provide earnings-related disability benefits that serve as income replacement in case of full or
partial disability. In 27 countries (20 of which also have
social insurance schemes), disability benefits are provided through a non-contributory universal scheme to
all persons with assessed disabilities without regard to
their income status. In 54 countries, social insurance is
combined with means-tested benefits. In a further six
countries, disability benefits are limited to means-tested
benefits only. In 11 countries, the law provides for lump
sums to be paid; four countries have no such scheme anchored in national legislation.
As figure 3.17 shows, in a significant number of
countries (81) the only form of income protection available to persons with disabilities consists of benefits paid
through employment-related social insurance. Although
in some countries disability-related needs may be covered through general social assistance benefits, the lack
of specific non-contributory disability benefits raises
concerns about the lack of protection of children with
disabilities (UNICEF, 2013), and of adults with disabilities who have never been able to work (whether because
their disability existed at birth, or they became disabled
before working age, or they had no access to education
and, consequently, no access to employment) and so have
never been able to contribute to social insurance. Without access either to employment with social security
coverage, or to non-contributory benefits, persons with
disabilities and their families are more at risk of poverty.
Some important regional differences can be observed regarding the scope of coverage (see figure 3.18).
A first group of countries ensure the provision of disability cash benefits to eligible persons through social
insurance mechanisms. These may be combined with
non-contributory universal (or categorical) benefits, as
in several countries in northern Europe (Finland, Denmark, Iceland), Eastern Europe and the CIS (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russian Federation, Hungary), together

45  For discussion of universal health coverage, see Chapter 5 below.
46  It is also necessary to recognize that disability is a result of the interaction between a person with impairments and barriers in society,
in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

European countries, including the United Kingdom.
Similarly, Indonesia’s Jaminan Sosial Penyandang Cacat
programme, while in principle providing cash transfers
to people with severe disabilities in the poorest 40 per
cent of the population, is subject to a limitation on funds
resulting in very low coverage, estimated at 1.8 per cent
of the target group (ILO, 2012e). On the other hand, the
integrated Bono de Desarrollo Humano programme in
Ecuador offers an encouraging illustration of extension
of coverage to a significant proportion of persons with
disabilities, who made up 1.7 per cent of beneficiaries
in 2012, as compared with just 0.1 per cent before 2007
(Cecchini and Madariaga, 2011).

with a few from other regions (notably the Plurinational
State of Bolivia, Namibia and Mauritius); some other
countries (Brunei, Hong Kong (China), New Zealand,
Timor-Leste) rely simply on non-contributory provision.
In 54 countries, mainly in Western Europe and
Latin America, social insurance is complemented by
poverty-targeted schemes, either specific to persons with
disabilities or within more widely integrated social assistance programmes (as for instance Bono de Desarrollo
Humano in Ecuador). A third group of countries, including Australia, South Africa and Nepal, have schemes
which simply target poor persons with disabilities.
A fourth group of 81 countries, mainly in Africa, the
Middle East as well as Asia and the Pacific, provide social
insurance benefits but exclude from that protection
people outside formal employment. In these countries,
it can be assumed that more limited coverage is likely to
be achieved in the absence of a specific disability scheme
to respond to the needs of persons with disabilities who
are not in formal employment. In many of these cases,
such people can gain access to benefits only through
general social assistance programmes which cater partially for their specific needs. In addition, the extent to
which national schemes provide for persons with disabilities may be curtailed by “capped” budgetary allocations: this has been the case for the scheme in Nepal,
which has notionally wide outreach, and seems likely to
happen as a result of recent reforms taken in the light of
moves towards fiscal consolidation even in the better-off

3.4.3 Effective coverage for disability benefits
From the above review of the types of programmes in
existence, it is possible to draw some inferences about
levels of coverage, although the extent of available data
does not allow for a fully detailed statistical assessment
on the global scale. In order to calculate effective coverage ratios, it would be necessary to relate the number of
beneficiaries of disability benefits to the number of persons with disabilities affecting their earning capacity in
each country.
In countries of the European Union, on average
27.9 per cent of persons with disabilities receive a disability benefit (see figure 3.19).47 This coverage ratio

Box 3.10  Income security for persons with disabilities: Illustrations from Europe
Income security for persons with disabilities is a critical issue, in view of functional limitations and difficulties in accessing quality employment. At the EU level, the employment rate of persons with disabilities is
much lower (45.5 per cent in 2010) than that of those without disabilities (71.7 per cent), and for those with
severe disabilities it is lower still (26.2 per cent).
Disability benefits and other social security benefits can partially correct for some labour market inequalities, but only to a certain extent. In 2010, 19.1 per cent (19.9 per cent in 2009) of persons with disabilities
compared with 14.7 per cent (14.3 per cent in 2009) of persons without disabilities lived in households
classified as being at risk of poverty. The differential varies sharply between countries: it is relatively low
in Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia and the Netherlands but significantly greater in, for example, the United
Kingdom, Slovenia and Portugal.

may appear low, but it should be noted that not all persons with a disability either need or are entitled to a
benefit; benefits are normally provided to persons with
disabilities that are severe enough to significantly affect
their functional capacities, and thereby their earning
capacity.
Nonetheless, persons with disabilities remain at
higher risk of poverty than others (see box 3.10).
3.4.4 Recent developments and challenges
In recent years some countries have taken decisive steps
to extend the coverage of disability benefits and enhance the adequacy of benefits (see box 3.11). Measures
to extend the coverage of pension insurance to more
groups of the population (e.g. self-employed, domestic

workers) often include coverage for disability. The emergence of cash transfer programmes covering poor and
vulnerable categories of the population is also of particular relevance, as the presence in the household of
a person with a disability at a degree that affects his or
her earning capacity is often one of the eligibility criteria of these programmes. Other existing non-contributory programmes have extended coverage by raising the
means-testing threshold.
At the same time, disability benefits were not spared
from fiscal consolidation measures introduced in the
wake of the global crisis, some of which – adding to the
more difficult labour market situation – significantly
reduced income security for persons with disabilities
(for examples, see box 3.11).
Some of the recent policy reforms continue a longerstanding trend to bring beneficiaries of disability

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.11  Recent developments: Country examples
Some recent reforms in the area of disability benefits have aimed at extending coverage and better meeting
the needs of persons with disabilities:
•	 In Paraguay, coverage was extended in 2013 to allow self-employed, female heads of household, and
domestic workers, to enrol voluntarily in the disability insurance scheme (OASDI).
•	 South Africa extended the coverage for the disability grant in 2011 by applying a higher threshold for the
means-test.
•	 In Ghana, the presence of a person with a severe impairment in a poor household is one of the eligibility
criteria under the LEAP programme introduced in 2008.
Other recent reforms in the area of social protection for persons with disabilities include some fiscal consolidation measures:
•	 In Hungary, the disability pension was replaced in 2012 with a combination of a rehabilitation benefit
(three years for retraining and re-entry in the labour force where feasible) and a significantly restricted
disability benefit. The Government envisaged savings of around €800 million as a result.
•	 In Lithuania, between 2010 and 2012 both the Special Compensation for Care Expenses and the Special
Compensation for Attendance Expenses were temporarily paid at 85 per cent of their normal value.
•	 In Ireland, disability benefits have been cut by about 5 per cent since 2008, including invalidity pensions for
persons aged under 65, most long-term care cash benefits and the non-contributory disability allowance.

Box 3.12  How social protection can help persons
with disabilities gain access to employment
Measures to facilitate the transition from receiving benefits to performing work have been introduced in
several countries. Examples include a requirement that employers provide occupational health services and
support for reintegration and employment; and so-called “bridging arrangements”, transitional arrangements
which allow persons with disabilities who take up work to retain benefits until a certain wage threshold is
reached, to resume receipt of benefits without delay should they lose their jobs, and to retain their right
to benefits in kind – such as health care – for a specified period. This is the case in Australia, where, in
order to encourage their greater participation in work, Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients can now
work for 30 hours per week before their benefit entitlements are affected. This change was combined with
extra support for people with disability, including more employment services and financial incentives for
employers to take on more persons with disabilities.
The Government in Ireland is committed to helping persons with disabilities to participate more fully in
society, and to become more self-sufficient, by providing support to address financial and other barriers,
as outlined in Department for Social Protection’s disability sectoral plan. The Reasonable Accommodation
Fund for the Employment of Disabled People functions as an umbrella covering a series of private sector
employment support programmes to help persons with disabilities to access and progress in employment.
The Work Choice programme introduced in the United Kingdom in 2010 targets persons with disabilities
facing complex barriers to employment to help them prepare to enter work, find a job, stay in work and
progress into open, unsupported employment.
In Saudi Arabia, the Tawafuq programme was dedicated to the extension of jobseeking support to persons
with disabilities, through an encompassing framework including six areas: regulations and frameworks; accessibility; stakeholder awareness; employment programmes; skills and training; and disability data.
The Government of the United States provides funding and technical support for states to develop
their strategies for disability employment policy, and grants funds to states that improve education and
employment outcomes of persons with disabilities.
In the Russian Federation, the introduction in 2013 of amendments to the Federal Law on the Social
Protection of Persons with Disabilities was intended to fill a gap in the legal regulation of employment of
persons with disabilities. Also in 2013, public organizations for persons with disabilities planned to offer
assistance in finding employment and to create 692 jobs for persons with disabilities. The total amount
of subsidies from the federal budget to support public organizations for persons with disabilities was set
at 124.36 million roubles. Since 2010, more than 7,800 unemployed persons with disabilities have found
employment at workplaces where employers have equipped their work spaces to meet their physical needs.

benefits into employment through measures that support the return to work and strengthen the employability of persons with disabilities (ILO and OECD,
2013; see also box 3.12). In OECD countries, most of
the policy reforms prior to 2010 focused on contributory disability pensions, reducing levels of compensation and strengthening measures to bring beneficiaries
(back) into employment (OECD, 2010b; ISSA, 2012).
Some of these measures aimed to reverse the earlier
trend of moving beneficiaries of unemployment benefits to disability benefit schemes: in several countries
(e.g. Australia, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and, more recently, Hungary), people with significant capacity for work are no longer eligible for partial
disability benefits, but are supported in seeking parttime work through wage subsidies and other in-work
benefits, or receive unemployment or other benefits.
While in some countries such reforms have had a significant impact on eligibility conditions and benefit
levels, they have had only limited success in increasing
the proportion of persons with disabilities in employment. The reasons for this include an often unfavourable labour market situation and uneven implementation
of effective rehabilitation, insertion and other measures
intended to facilitate their (re-)integration into employment (OECD, 2010b).
This assessment highlights an ambiguity often
found in activation policies. Effective measures that
support persons with disabilities in finding and retaining quality employment are a key element of non-discriminatory and inclusive policies that help to realize
their rights and aspirations as productive members of
society. There is, however, a risk that such policies may
restrict the rights of those who, for various reasons, are
not able to find suitable employment, and for whom
such reforms may result in a reduction of income security and potentially higher risk of poverty. Policy reforms should therefore pay special attention to finding
the right balance between supporting engagement in
employment and providing an adequate level of income
security for persons with disabilities, and promoting
their individual autonomy and independence, and their
full and effective participation in society.

3.5 Maternity protection
KEY MESSAGES
nn Effective maternity protection ensures income
security for pregnant women and mothers of
newborn children and their families, and also
effective access to quality maternal health
care. It also promotes equality in employment
and occupation.
nn Worldwide, less than 40 per cent of women
in employment are covered by law under
mandatory maternity cash benefit schemes;
57 per cent if voluntary coverage (mainly for
women in self-employment) is included.
nn Due to the ineffective enforcement and implementation of the law in some regions (Asia
and the Pacific, Latin America and Africa in
particular), effective coverage is even lower:
only 28 per cent of women in employment
worldwide are protected through contributory
or non-contributory maternity cash benefits.
nn An increasing number of countries are using
non-contributory maternity cash benefits as
a means to improve income security and
access to maternal and child health care for
pregnant women and new mothers, particularly for women living in poverty. However,
significant gaps remain.
nn Ensuring effective access to quality maternal
health care is of particular importance,
especially in countries where the informal
economy accounts for a large proportion of
employment.

3.5.1 Maternity protection: Ensuring income
security, maternal health care and
women’s rights at work
Maternity protection is multidimensional. From a social
security perspective, it includes protection against suspension or loss of income during maternity leave, and
access to maternal health care (see ILO, 2010c). Maternity leave supported with cash benefits to fully or partially replace women’s earnings during the final stages of
pregnancy and after childbirth is of critical importance
for the well-being of pregnant women, new mothers and
their families. The absence of income security during
the final stages of pregnancy and after childbirth forces
many women, especially those in the informal economy,
to return to work prematurely, thereby putting at risk
their own and their children’s health.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.13  International standards relevant to maternity protection
Maternity protection has long been regarded by the international community as an essential prerequisite for
the achievement of women’s rights and gender equality. Women’s right to maternity protection is enshrined
in a number of major human rights instruments. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, notably
states that motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance, as well as to social security. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, establishes the right of
mothers to special protection during a reasonable period before and after childbirth, including paid leave or
leave with adequate social security benefits. The Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979, recommends that special measures be taken to ensure maternity protection,
proclaimed as an essential right permeating all areas of the Convention.
The ILO has led the establishment of international standards on maternity protection, adopting the first
international standard on this subject in the very year of its foundation: the Maternity Protection Convention,
1919 (No. 3). Since then, a number of more progressive instruments have been adopted in line with the
steady increase in women’s participation in the labour market in most countries worldwide. The current ILO
maternity protection standards provide detailed guidance for national policy-making and action to enable
women to successfully combine their reproductive and productive roles. To this end, the standards aim to
ensure that women benefit from adequate maternity leave, income and health protection measures, that
they do not suffer discrimination on maternity-related grounds, that they enjoy the right to nursing breaks
and that they are not required to perform work prejudicial to their health or that of their child. In order to
protect the situation of women in the labour market, ILO maternity protection standards specifically require
that cash benefits be provided through schemes based on solidarity and risk-pooling, such as compulsory
social insurance or public funds, while strictly circumscribing the potential liability of employers for the
direct cost of benefits. At the same time, the relevant standards aim at ensuring that women have access to
adequate maternal health care and services during pregnancy and childbirth, and beyond.
Convention No. 102 (Part VIII) sets minimum standards as to the population coverage of maternity protection schemes and for the provision of cash benefits during maternity leave, to address the suspension of
earnings during this time (see Annex III, table AIII.7). The Convention also defines the medical care that
must be provided free of charge at all stages of maternity, as required to maintain, restore or improve the
health of the women protected and their ability to work, and to attend their personal needs. Maternal health
care must be available not only to the women participating in a maternity protection scheme, but also to the
wives of men covered by such schemes, at no cost to either.
The Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183), and its accompanying Recommendation (No. 191),
are the most up-to-date ILO standards on maternity protection. They set higher and more comprehensive
standards on population coverage, health protection, maternity leave and leave in case of illness or complications, cash benefits, employment protection and non-discrimination, as well as breastfeeding.
Recommendation No. 202 calls for such benefits to be provided as part of the basic social security
guarantees that make up social protection floors. These include access to essential health care, including
maternity care, comprising a set of necessary goods and services, and basic income security for persons
of active age who are unable to earn sufficient income due, inter alia, to maternity. Maternity medical care
should meet criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (United Nations, 2000); it should
be free for the most vulnerable; and conditions of access should not be such as to create hardship or
increase the risk of poverty for people in need of health care. Cash benefits should be sufficient to allow
women and their children a life in dignity, out of poverty. Maternity benefits should be granted at least to all
residents, with the objective of achieving universal protection; a variety of schemes can be used to achieve
such coverage, including universal schemes, social insurance, social assistance and other social transfers,
providing benefits in cash or in kind.

Another fundamental component of maternity protection is maternal health care, namely effective access
to adequate medical care and services during pregnancy
and childbirth, and beyond, to ensure the health of
both mothers and children. As with health care in general (see Chapter 5), a lack of effective access to maternal health care coverage not only puts the health of
women and children at risk, but also exposes families to
significantly increased risk of poverty.
According to ILO standards (see box 3.13), maternity protection also includes the protection of women’s

rights at work during maternity and beyond, through
measures that safeguard employment, protect women
against discrimination and dismissals, and allow them
to return to their jobs after maternity leave under conditions that take into account their specific circumstances (ILO, 2010c; ILO, 2013e; ILO, 2014e). It also
includes occupational safety and health components
that are essential to protect the health of pregnant
and breastfeeding women and their babies, as well as
­women’s r­ eproductive capacity.

Box 3.14  Maternity protection: Collectively financed schemes
vs employer’s liability provisions

62

Maternity cash benefits can be provided by different types of schemes: contributory (e.g. social insurance),
non-contributory, usually tax-financed (e.g. social assistance and universal schemes) and employer’s liability provisions. Collectively financed schemes, funded from insurance contributions, taxation or both,
are based on the principles of solidarity and risk-pooling, and therefore ensure a fairer distribution of the
costs and responsibility of reproduction. Employer’s liability provisions, on the other hand, oblige employers
to bear the economic costs of maternity directly, which often results in a double burden (payment of both
women’s wages during maternity leave and costs of their replacement), although employers may be able to
obtain commercial insurance to cover their liabilities. While some individual workers may obtain appropriate
compensation under such provisions, employers may be tempted to adopt practices that deny women the
income security to which they should be entitled in order to avoid the related costs and the financial hardship that they may entail for small businesses or in times of instability. Discrimination against women of
childbearing age in hiring and in employment, and non-payment of due compensation by the employer, are
more commonly evident in the absence of collective mechanisms to finance maternity protection. Pressure
on women to resume work to the detriment of their health or that of their child may also be more prevalent
where employers have to bear the costs of maternity leave.
In order to protect the situation of women in the labour market, Convention No. 183 states a preference for compulsory social insurance or publicly funded programmes as the vehicles for provision of cash
benefits to women during maternity leave, confining individual employers’ liability for the direct costs of
benefits to a limited range of cases.a Where women do not meet qualifying conditions for entitlement to
maternity cash benefits, Convention No. 183 requires the provision of adequate benefits financed by social
assistance funds, on a means-tested basis.
Maternity cash benefits financed collectively have proved the more effective means of securing an
income to women during maternity leave. In recent years, several countries have shifted from employer’s
liability provisions to collectively financed maternity benefits, a trend that represents an advance for the
promotion of equal treatment for men and women in the labour market.
  According to Art. 6, para. 8, of Convention No. 183: ”An employer shall not be individually liable for the direct cost of
any such monetary benefit to a woman employed by him or her without that employer’s specific agreement except where:
(a) such is provided for in national law or practice in a member State prior to the date of adoption of this Convention by the
International Labour Conference; or (b) it is subsequently agreed at the national level by the government and the representative organizations of employers and workers.”

3.5.2 Types of maternity protection schemes
Maternity cash benefits are provided through schemes
anchored in national social security legislation in 136 out
of the 188 countries reviewed. A further two countries
allow women to take maternity leave by law, but make no
legal provision for replacement of their earned income.
Of those 188, 50 countries – 38 of them in Africa
or Asia – have provisions in their labour legislation setting out a mandatory period of maternity leave and establishing the employer’s liability for the payment of the
woman’s salary (or a percentage thereof) during that
period (see box 3.14).
Most maternity cash benefit schemes and employer’s
liability provisions cover only women in formal employment. Consequently, in many low- and middle-income
countries, where levels of formal employment are lower,

maternity benefits are available only to a minority of
women. Figure 3.21 shows the types of programmes
existing in the 188 countries for which information is
available. Social insurance schemes form the vast majority of these programmes, prevailing in 134 countries, of
which 11 also operate social assistance schemes.48
3.5.3 Extent of legal coverage
Worldwide, the vast majority of women in employment are still not protected against loss of income
in the event of maternity. Only 35.3 per cent of employed women benefit from mandatory coverage by
law and thus are legally entitled to periodic cash benefits as  income replacement during their maternity
leave.49 In 55 countries (67 countries when voluntary

48  For more detailed characteristics of the schemes in place in different countries, see Annex IV, table B.5.
49  When including voluntary coverage, legal coverage concerns nearly half of all women in employment (56.8 per cent), with the 20 additional
percentage points concerning mainly the choice left to the self-employed to join (or not) the existing contributory scheme on a voluntary basis.
In many countries, such voluntary provisions are taken up only sparsely; thus voluntary coverage may not reach the same level of protection as
compared to mandatory coverage.

Note: In the United States there is no national programme. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 1993, maternity leave is unpaid as a general
rule; however, subject to certain conditions accrued paid leave (such as vacation leave, personal leave, medical or sick leave, or paid medical
leave) may be used to cover some or all of the leave to which a woman is entitled under the Act. A cash benefit may be provided at the state level.
Provisions for maternity cash benefits exist in five states (New York, New Jersey, California, Hawaii and Rhode Island), under the class of temporary
disability insurance for employees. Additionally, employers may offer paid maternity leave as a job benefit.

in ensuring income security
during maternity leave

Irrespective of legal requirements, there may be obstacles that prevent women from receiving the benefits
to which they are entitled. In fact, just above one-quarter (28.4 per cent) of employed women worldwide are
effectively protected in maternity through contributory or non-contributory cash benefits. In much of
Africa and South Asia, a small minority of women in
employment (less than 10 per cent) are effectively protected through contributory or non-contributory forms
of cash maternity benefits (figure 3.23). It is in many
of these countries that employer’s liability provisions
(see figure 3.21) prevail, informal employment plays a

The adequacy of cash benefits provided during maternity leave to meet the needs of mothers and their
babies can be assessed in terms of duration and amount.
In order to allow women to fully recover after childbirth, 96 countries out of 188 provide at least 14 weeks’
paid maternity leave, meeting the standards of Convention No. 183; of these, 31 countries provide 18–26
weeks, and ten more than 26 weeks (see figure 3.24).
In 59 countries, the length of paid maternity leave is
12–13 weeks, which still meets the minimum standard
set out in Convention No. 102. In 31 countries, maternity leave with cash benefits is less than 12 weeks.

3.5.6 Access to maternal health care
Access to free, affordable and appropriate antenatal and
post-natal health care and services for pregnant women
and mothers with newborns is an essential component
of maternity protection. Access to maternal health care
is closely associated with access to health care in general, which is discussed in Chapter 5.
The importance of guaranteed access to maternal
health care in safeguarding maternal and infant health
is highlighted in the Millennium Development Goals,
particularly MDG5 on improving maternal health and
MDG3 on reducing child mortality. While remarkable
progress has been achieved in many countries in reducing maternal and child mortality, some countries are
still facing major challenges in this regard (UN, 2013b).
It is widely recognized that one of the key enabling
factors for maternal and child health is access to antenatal care, which is still uneven and far from universal in many regions (see figure 3.26). According to the
latest available data, while 84.2 per cent of childbearing
women receive antenatal care provided by skilled personnel during at least one visit to a health facility, only
60.8 per cent of them were monitored during at least
four visits. In sub-Saharan Africa, more than a quarter
of childbearing women did not receive any ante­natal
care provided by skilled health personnel; the same is

The level of the maternity cash benefit, calculated as
a proportion of women’s previous earnings for a minimum number of weeks of paid maternity leave, varies
widely from country to country (figure 3.25). In 77
out of the 188 countries, women are entitled to paid
maternity leave of at least two-thirds of their regular
salary for a minimum period of 14 weeks, meeting the
benchmark of Convention No. 183. In 28 countries
(nearly 15 per cent of the total reviewed), women are
entitled to 100 per cent of their regular salary for at
least 18 weeks, meeting the highest standard set out in
Recommendation No. 191. An additional 17 countries
provide benefit at a fixed level (for instance, the minimum wage). This leaves a large number of countries
(61) in which women are entitled to benefit at a level
lower than 67 per cent of previous earnings for a period
of 12–13 weeks, which falls short of the benchmark of
Convention No. 183 but is still in compliance with the
minimum requirements of Convention No. 102. In
31 countries, the cash benefit corresponds to less than
45 per cent of the previous salary and/or the period of
paid maternity leave is inferior to 12 weeks.

true for one in five women in North Africa, and one in
six women in Asia and the Pacific.
Health coverage is a key factor in facilitating access
to maternal health care (figure 3.27). Access to ante­
natal care is high where health protection is available to
the majority of the population, but lower where a large
proportion of the population is not protected.
In many parts of the world, access to maternal
health care is uneven and subject to significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and between poorer
and more affluent groups of the population (see, e.g.,
Nawal, Sekher and Goli, 2013). In many developing
countries, such disparities are closely associated with
a lack of universal access to available and affordable
health-care services of adequate quality, but the lack of
financial protection that would allow women to benefit
from existing services is also an important factor.
Inequalities in access to maternal health services
(both antenatal care and medical care during and after
childbirth) jeopardize further progress with respect to
maternal and child health in both middle- and lowincome countries. In most of these countries we observe significant levels of inequity in access to maternal
health care across regions, and between residents of
urban and rural areas, with urban populations tending
to have better access to maternal health services. While
inequalities are observed between urban and rural areas
in countries in all parts of the world, the differential is

much larger in Africa and in Asia and the Pacific than
in other regions. These differentials are often associated with a lower density of health-care services in rural
areas.
Another significant vector of inequality in access
to maternity health protection is household wealth. In
both low- and middle-income countries, only a small
fraction of women in the lowest wealth quintile have
access to maternal health protection, as compared to
women in the highest wealth quintile (see figure 3.28).
Such inequalities have detrimental effects on both maternal and child health, with often harmful long-term
consequences for both individuals and societies.
Figure 3.29 illustrates the importance of providing
quality maternal care services by showing the inverse
correlation across countries between the percentage of
births supervised by skilled birth attendants and the
maternal mortality ratio.
Moreover, the available evidence suggests that
income security also contributes to the well-being of
pregnant women, new mothers and their children.
Countries that have a higher level of coverage for maternity cash benefits also tend to achieve better results with
respect to maternal mortality ratios. These results call
for a comprehensive approach to maternity protection,
combining maternal health care and income security,
and also occupational safety and health measures, as
stipulated in ILO maternity protection standards.

3.5.7 Recent developments
Maternity protection is recognized globally as a crucial component of social protection – effectively, as an
investment to secure each country’s future human capital – as shown by the number and range of recent and
continuing policy initiatives.
Changes in maternity protection schemes in different countries can be broadly classified as follows:
•	 extension of coverage, by enlarging the scope of existing schemes or introducing new contributory or
non-contributory schemes;
•	 adjustments to the level of (cash) maternity benefits/
allowances; or
•	 adjustments to the duration of benefits.

Extending maternity protection coverage
Many countries (for example, Australia, Jordan and
South Africa) have enacted reforms that extend the
scope of maternity coverage to categories of women who
were previously unprotected. This has been achieved
through a variety of measures (see box 3.15).
A number of countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, India and

Indonesia, have introduced or extended non-contributory maternity benefits to women workers in the
informal economy or poor women in general. Noncontributory benefits are usually not directly associated with an interruption of employment in the form
of maternity leave, but pursue a broader objective of
providing pregnant women and new mothers with a
predictable cash benefit during the final stages of their
pregnancy and after childbirth.
Some of these programmes combine cash transfers
with conditions relating to the utilization of maternal care services, with the aims of encouraging breastfeeding and improving nutrition. In some countries,
pregnant women and new mothers are among the
target groups in broader conditional cash transfer programmes. In others, there are specific programmes for
maternity benefits. Many of these programmes explicitly aim at reducing maternal and child mortality in
accordance with the MDGs and with national poverty reduction or social protection strategies. Some programmes explicitly aim at increasing the acceptance of
family planning methods and reducing the incidence
of child marriage. Benefits are usually provided only to
women above a certain minimum age, and only for a
certain number of pregnancies. Dedicated conditional
cash transfer programmes have recently emerged in
Bangladesh, Bolivia, India and Indonesia (see box 3.16).

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.15  Maternity cash benefits: Some examples of recent expansion of coverage
A number of countries have extended coverage of maternity benefits to in recent years.
•	 Jordan established a new maternity benefit in 2011, covering workers in the private sector, financed
through employer contributions of 0.75 per cent of assessable earnings. The scheme gives insured
women the right to paid maternity leave at 100 per cent of previous earnings for a maximum of ten
weeks. This benefit is expected to foster women’s participation in the labour market and remove disincentives to the hiring of women.
•	 In Australia, the National Paid Parental Leave scheme, introduced in 2011, established an entitlement to
18 weeks of government-funded parental leave pay at the rate of the national minimum wage for eligible
working parents (mothers and fathers). The scheme is subject to a (relatively generous) means test. Together with the “baby bonus” that is also paid to non-working parents and is subject to a stricter means
test, the parental leave scheme reaches close to universal coverage.
•	 In South Africa, in 2003, domestic workers were brought under the Unemployment Insurance Fund,
which is also responsible for the payment of maternity benefits.
Several countries introduced non-contributory benefits to extend the coverage of maternity benefits to those
who are usually not covered by contributory schemes.
•	 Argentina introduced a universal birth allowance in 2011, which covers women from the 12th week of
pregnancy to the birth or end of pregnancy. This non-contributory programme complements the birth
allowance provided by the social insurance scheme. The programme covered 22 per cent of births in
Argentina in 2011, covering on average more than 66,000 women per month between May 2011 and
June 2012.
In some countries, the receipt of non-contributory maternity benefits is linked to the fulfilment of certain
conditions with regard to antenatal and post-natal health care.
•	 In Bangladesh, the Maternity Allowance Programme for Poor Lactating Mothers, introduced in 2008, targets women aged 20 and over, living on a monthly income of less than 1,500 taka; it also covers mothers
with a disability and women who are the breadwinners of poor families. If eligible, they one-time support
during either the first or second pregnancy to the amount of 350 taka per month for a period of two years.
•	 In Bolivia, the Bono Madre Niño and Bono Juana Azurduy de Padilla benefits are targeted on poor
women and their families without medical insurance or access to the breastfeeding grant. During pregnancy and the first two years of the life of the child, beneficiaries receive cash benefits on condition that
they follow a schedule of regular health checkups for both mother and child.
•	 In India, the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY) programme, introduced in 2010, provides
cash benefits for pregnant women and lactating mothers in 52 pilot districts, covering approximately
1.38 million women. A daily benefit for all women aged 19 and over (limited to first two pregnancies; and
excluding those who are covered through benefits provided to public sector employees) of approximately
US$1.68 for approximately 40 days aims at providing partial compensation for wage loss to encourage
women to take adequate rest before and after childbirth. In addition, all eligible women receive a cash
incentive of 4,000 rupees in three instalments from the end of the second trimester of pregnancy until
the child reaches six months of age, conditional upon compliance with various conditions pertaining to
registration, medical check-ups, vaccinations and breastfeeding practice.
•	 In Indonesia, the Keluarga Haparan (PKH) conditional cash transfer programme provided regular cash
benefits to 1.5 million poor households in 33 provinces in 2012; its conditions include the requirement
that pregnant women and lactating mothers regularly visit health facilities for check-ups. The programme
complements the Jampersal programme, introduced in 2011, which provides universal free delivery care,
including prenatal and post-natal consultations.

Box 3.16  Measures to facilitate parents’ return to work
Supply-side measures to facilitate mothers’ return to work after childbirth through help with training and jobsearch were implemented in Japan and the Russian Federation. In the latter, access to training programmes
designed for jobseekers was extended to women on parental leave to care for a child under the age of three.
In 2011, 26,200 women benefited from these programmes, out of which 15,700 found jobs. Additional
measures included the introduction of flexible forms of work, self-employment programmes for women, and
pre-school education for children aged 3–7. A Japanese programme supporting mothers of young children
in their job search, for instance through nursing services, and information services was re-invigorated. In
2011, 69,000 women used the programme and successfully found a job.
In Italy, vouchers giving access to childcare services were introduced to promote female employment.
Through this and other measures, takeup of formal child care was increased significantly, from 1 million
children in 2011 to a projected 1.4 million in 2016/17, largely through direct financial assistance to families
for childcare, and also through childcare support for parents receiving income transfers who are training or
studying in order to find jobs. A one-day paid parental leave was introduced in 2012.
In Australia, Child Care Flexibility Trials and a Child Care Flexibility Fund were created to improve access
to childcare, particularly outside standard hours, and hence allow women more flexible participation in the
labour market. In addition to these supply-side measures, Australia also introduced parental leave pay at the
national minimum wage and two weeks’ payment for working fathers or partners. Since its implementation
in January 2011, 240,000 individuals have benefited from this measure. Flexible childcare arrangements
targeting families who require care outside standard working hours were also offered.

Box 3.17  Recent contraction measures
Some recent reforms have resulted in a significant reduction of benefit levels for certain categories of
beneficiaries.
•	 In the Czech Republic, the level of maternity benefit was temporarily reduced from 69 per cent to 60 per
cent of the daily basis of assessment per calendar day in 2010, but has since been raised again.
•	 Germany reduced maternity benefits from 67 per cent to 65 per cent of previous salary for those with net
earnings of more than €1,200 per month.
•	 Ireland reduced the maximum maternity benefit for new claimants from €262 to €230 per month as
of January 2014 with the objective of saving €30 million. From 2013/14, maternity benefit is treated as
taxable income. Consequently, around 48,000 women per year will be paying an average of €833 extra
each in taxation, yielding savings of €40 million.
•	 In Latvia, the replacement rate of maternity benefit was reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent of
insurable earnings in 2011. The Government also decided to extend the cap on the amount of sickness,
maternity, paternity, parental and unemployed benefits paid until 31 December 2014. These measures
are expected to save 25.83 million lat (LVL) in 2013 and LVL26.42 million in 2014.
•	 In Lithuania, the Law on Sickness and Maternity was amended in 2010 to temporarily reduce replacement rates of maternity/ paternity benefit from 100 per cent to 90 per cent of previous earnings.
•	 In Romania, a 15 per cent cut in maternity benefits was implemented as an emergency measure in
2010. The law enacting this reduction also changed the maternity benefits policy: benefits now amount to
75 per cent of previous earnings subject to a ceiling of 3,400 lei (RON) per month for a one-year period
of leave, and of RON1,200 for a two-year leave. A bonus of RON500 per month is available to workers
earning taxable income before the end of their one-year leave.
•	 In the United Kingdom, the conditional Health in Pregnancy grant of £190 for each expectant mother was
abolished in 2011 in order to reduce the government deficit. It has been replaced with a £500 grant for
first-time parents claiming other types of social benefits such as Income Support or Working Tax Credit.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Enhancing the duration and scope
of maternity benefits
Several countries have extended the duration of paid
maternity leave in law, following the adoption of Convention No. 183 in 2000. Although they have not yet
ratified it, China, Colombia and Malta now meet the
minimum benefit level requirements set by this Convention, and several countries, including Chile and the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, have gone further.
A number of other countries (including Finland and
Ireland) have increased the minimum rate of benefit
levels and indexation mechanisms.
In addition, a number of countries have strengthened complementary provisions relating to assistance
for mothers wishing to return to work (including Japan
and the Russian Federation) and those relating to
childcare facilities (including Australia and Italy; see
box 3.16).

Contraction measures
In the context of the financial and economic crisis, several countries have taken measures that have reduced
the level of maternity protection (see box  3.17). In
countries including the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, the level of maternity
benefits has been reduced. In addition, maternity benefits are now treated as taxable income in Ireland.
Some of these fiscal consolidation measures have
significantly reduced the level of maternity protection
available to certain groups of pregnant women and new
mothers. Although in some countries measures have
been taken to protect the levels of protection available
to those on lower incomes, other groups may still have
suffered marked reductions in the benefits they receive,
jeopardizing their income security during this critical
period of their lives. In addition, access to maternal
health care may also have suffered from cuts within
the health-care system (see Chapter 5). At a time when
many European governments are considering or implementing measures to encourage higher birth rates,
ill-designed fiscal consolidation measures may have unintended negative effects. It is thus necessary to carefully consider the short- and long-term impacts of
policy reforms in this area.

KEY MESSAGES
nn The right to income security in old age, as grounded in human rights
instruments and international labour standards, includes the right to an
adequate social security pension. In many countries with high shares of
informal employment, pensions are accessible only to a minority, and
many older persons can rely only on family support.
nn Nearly half (48  per cent) of all people over pensionable age do not
receive a pension. For many of those who do receive a pension, pension
levels are not adequate. As a result, the majority of the world’s older
women and men have no income security, have no right to retire and
have to continue working as long as they can – often badly paid and in
precarious conditions.
nn Under existing laws and regulations, only 42  per cent of people of
working age today can expect to receive contributory or non-contributory
social security pensions from contributory schemes in the future, and
effective coverage is likely to be even lower. This gap will have to be
filled to a large extent by an expansion of non-contributory provisions.
nn Many countries have recently made efforts to expand the coverage of
contributory pension schemes and to establish non-contributory pensions
to guarantee at least basic income security guarantee in old age to all.
nn At the same time, there is a continuous global pressure which – under
the guise of ensuring the sustainability of pensions in ageing societies
and consolidating public finances – aims at reducing state responsibility
for guaranteeing income security in old age and shifting large parts of
the economic risks associated with pension provision on to individuals,
thereby undermining the adequacy of pension systems and reducing
their ability to prevent poverty in old age. In some countries, recent
reversals of earlier reforms, including earlier privatizations of pension
systems, have addressed these challenges, including the erosion of pension adequacy.
nn The income security of older women and men depends also on their
access to social services, including health care and long-term care.

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

4.1 The crucial role of pensions
in ensuring income security
and well-being of older persons

74

It is essential that persons are provided with reliable
sources of income security throughout their old age. As
people grow older, they can rely less and less on income
from employment for a number of reasons: while highly
educated professionals may often continue well-remunerated occupations until late in their life, the majority of the population is usually excluded from access to
well-paid jobs at older ages. Private savings and assets
(including housing ownership) make a difference, but
for most people are usually not sufficient to guarantee
an adequate level of income security until the end of
their lives. Private, intra-family transfers may be important as an additional source of income security but
are very often far from sufficient and not always reliable,
in particular for families already struggling to live on a
low income.
For all these reasons, in many countries public pension systems became a foundation on which at least
basic income security has been built. Income security
in old age depends also on the availability of and access
to publicly provided social services – provided free or at
low charge – including health care and long-term care.
If secure and affordable access to such services is not
provided, older persons and their families are pushed
into extreme poverty.

4.2 Types of pension schemes
Public social security pensions have become important
institutional solutions to guarantee income security in
old age. Public pensions are usually supplemented in
that task by publicly regulated private provision. In
OECD countries, 59 per cent of household incomes of
men and women aged 65 and over comes from public
pension transfers (another 24 per cent comes from
income from employment and self-employment, and
17 per cent from capital income – mainly private pensions) (OECD, 2013a; see figure 4.1).1 This overall
picture, however, hides large variations between and
within countries. While in the majority of European
countries public pensions are the source of more than

60 per cent of older person’s incomes, in other regions – often due to limited public pension coverage –
this share is much smaller. In many countries of the
world, the pattern is similar to that evident in OECD
countries such as the Republic of Korea, Mexico and
Chile, where the majority of older persons’ income
comes from work.
In many OECD countries public pensions are the
main source of income for older persons, particularly
among the poorer part of the population: on average,
public pensions account for more than 80 per cent
of income for those in the lowest four deciles of the
income distribution, while income from employment
ranges between 5 and 9 per cent of the total income
of these groups. On the other hand, in the top four
deciles income from employment brings in between 20
and 40 per cent of all income of older persons. High
earners in high-quality jobs are also usually in good
health, fit and eager to continue their occupations, at
least part time; those in low-quality and badly paid jobs
often have to stop employment relatively early due to ill
health or because they have been made redundant. Also,
when older, they are excluded from earning opportunities which would supplement their low pensions.
Income from private pensions and other capital
income constitutes less than 10 per cent of the total
income of those in the lowest three deciles, after which
this share grows with income to reach one-quarter in
the top decile.
In some parts of the world outside the OECD,
coverage by public pensions is low and pensions play
a less prominent role as a source of income for less affluent groups of the population. The majority of older
women and men in these countries work as long as they
physically can – but this does not necessarily prevent
them from being in poverty. In OECD countries, as
figure 4.2 indicates, the greater the coverage by public
pensions and – as a result – the greater the share of
public pensions in older persons’ incomes, the less poverty there is. In other countries, where the informal
economy is large, the same pattern applies only where
coverage by non-contributory pensions is at a high level
(e.g. South Africa).
Housing wealth also has a significant impact on
standards of living and the extent of poverty among
older persons. Home ownership is usually much lower

1  Income from work includes both earnings and income from self-employment. Capital income includes private pensions as well as income
from returns on non-pension savings. Figure 4.1 shows the composition of incomes among individuals over 65 from work, capital and
public transfers, focusing on those in the first decile of income (lowest), the fifth decile (middle) and the tenth decile (highest). For more
information, see OECD, 2013a, p. 72.

among lower-income households, and thus has only
limited impact on the risk of poverty: in EU countries,
for example, inclusion of estimates of so-called “imputed rent” (rent that the owners do not pay because
they own their house) decrease the relative risk-of-­
poverty incidence by only 3.5 percentage points
(OECD, 2013a, p. 104).
Whether cash income from pensions or other transfers is sufficient to ensure income security depends on
many other factors, such as the need to pay for healthcare services, housing, long-term care, and other goods
and services if needed. How provision of these services
is secured and how are they financed also determine
levels of income security in old age. An OECD study

(OECD, 2013a, Chapter 2), shows, for example, that
publicly provided in-kind services (including health
care and long-term care) add on average 40 per cent
to the value of monetary incomes of people aged 65
and over in OECD countries (compared to only 24 per
cent for people of working age). In countries with wider
access to quality public services, poverty in old age is
also significantly lower. In most non-OECD countries,
however, availability of and access to public services is
often very limited and thus they do not play a similar
role in the enhancing incomes of older persons and reducing poverty among them.
There exist a wide range of schemes providing different types of cash and in-kind benefits to older persons. In

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

addition to the public social services mentioned above,
in-kind benefits may include housing and energy subsidies, home help and care services, and residential care.
Cash benefits can be periodic payments awarded at
reaching a specified age (and also often meeting other
prescribed entitlement conditions) which are then paid
throughout the remainder of the beneficiary’s life. Such
periodic payments are called pensions (or life annuities),
and can be classified into two main types:
•	 Old-age pensions from contributory schemes of
mandatory public social insurance and/or voluntary
occupational or other private pension schemes.

76

•	 Old-age pensions from public non-contributory
schemes, which can be (a) universal, covering all
people above the eligible age who meet either a citizenship or minimum duration of residency condition; (b) pension tested;2 or (c) means tested.3 Most
non-contributory schemes are national, but some are
limited to certain geographical areas.4
Only pensions (that is, periodic payments: mainly life
annuities but also means-tested benefits) are recognized
by ILO standards such as Convention No. 102, or the
Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits Convention,
1967 (No. 128), as benefits potentially able to protect
individuals properly against the risk of outliving their
own savings or assets. However, sometimes contributory
pension schemes pay part of the benefit as a lump sum.
In such situations it is important to make sure that the
annuity part of the overall benefit is adequate. In many
countries only a lump sum is available, or (as for example in Chile) people can opt at retirement for so-called
“scheduled withdrawal” (under which their pensions are
paid not as a life annuity but only for a limited number
of years): such arrangements do not guarantee the level
of security required by international standards.
The benefit expenditure data presented in this chapter attempt to cover, as far as evidence is available, all

types of benefits provided by mandatory or quasi-mandatory (voluntary but with very wide coverage) schemes
established by legislation, regulations or collective
agreements. The indicators for the scope and extent of
coverage take into account only coverage by any kind
of cash periodic benefits (pensions); schemes providing
lump-sum payments alone do not qualify.
The broad majority of countries (166 out of
178 countries for which information is available) provide pensions through at least one scheme, and often
through a combination of different types of contributory and non-contributory schemes (see figure 4.3). The
remaining 12 countries provide only lump-sum benefits
through provident funds or similar programmes.
However, in 77 countries (over 43 per cent of the
total number of countries but nearly 70 per cent of
low-income countries) there exist schemes covering,
on a contributory basis, only employees in the formal
economy and exceptionally also certain groups of selfemployed. In an equal number of countries, such employment-related contributory pension schemes are
complemented by non-contributory schemes, either
aimed at all older persons (27 countries) or at only
those below a certain income threshold (50 countries). In only a small number are pensions provided
on a non-contributory basis to all older people (nine
countries) or to all those who pass a means test (three
countries).
Globally, more than half of total public non-health
social security expenditure, amounting to 3.3 per cent
of global GDP, is allocated to income security for older
persons (see figures 4.4 and 4.5).5 Variations among
regions are obviously influenced by differences in the
demographic structure of the population, but also by
variations in the policy mix between public and private provision for pensions and social services. Public
non-health social protection expenditure for older persons takes the highest proportion of GDP in Western
Europe, at 11.1 per cent, followed by 8.3 per cent of

2  Non-contributory pensions of this type are provided to those older persons who do not receive a contributory pension at all, or whose
contributory pension is below a certain minimum threshold; other types of incomes are not taken into account (as would be the case for
means-tested pensions). Examples of this type of scheme include the Old Age Social Pension in Armenia and similar pensions in most
CIS countries, as well as the “100 a los 70” scheme in Panama, the Old Age Allowance in Nepal, and the Allowance for Older People in
Thailand.
3  Means-tested pensions are provided only to those older persons whose pension and other income remains below a certain threshold.
Means-tested pensions are not, strictly speaking, life annuities if designed and implemented in a way which includes all in need and at
a level “sufficient to maintain the family of the beneficiary in health and decency” according to the requirements of ILO standards. The
Older Persons’ Grant in South Africa, for example, although means tested, effectively covers the majority of older people in the country and
effectively prevents the recipients and their families from falling into poverty.
4  For example, the Programa Colombia Mayor.
5  While the data include not only pensions but, so far as possible, other cash and in-kind benefits for older persons, they do not usually
include expenditure on long-term care, the cost of which in many countries is already significant and is likely to increase further in the
future due to demographic change.

GDP in Africa, where the share of older persons in the

than half of the world’s older persons live in the Asia
and Pacific region, and that their numbers are set to
increase rapidly over the coming years, this figure suggests a disproportionately low (in relation to the size of
the older population) allocation of resources to income
security in old age, as one element of a wider need to
invest more in social protection (UN, 2013e).

Box 4.1  International standards on old-age pensions
The rights of older persons to social security and to an adequate standard of living to support their health
and well-being, including medical care and necessary social services, are laid down in the major international human rights instruments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948, and (in more
general terms) the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966.1 The
content of these rights is further specified in the normative body of standards developed by the ILO, which
provide concrete guidance to countries for giving effect to the right of older persons to social security, from
basic levels to full realization.2
The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), the Old-Age, Invalidity and Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), and its accompanying Recommendation No. 131, and the
Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), provide an international reference framework
setting out the range and levels of social security benefits that are necessary and adequate for ensuring
income maintenance and income security, as well as access to health care, in old age. The extension of
coverage to all older persons is an underlying objective of these standards, with the aim of achieving universality of protection, as explicitly stated in Recommendation No. 202.
Conventions Nos 102 and 128 and Recommendation No. 131 make provision for the payment of pensions in old age, at guaranteed levels, upon completion of a qualifying period, and their regular adjustment
to maintain pensioners’ purchasing power. More particularly, Conventions Nos 102 and 128 envisage the
provision of income security to people who have reached pensionable age through earnings-related contributory pensions (guaranteeing minimum benefit levels, or replacement rates, corresponding to a prescribed
proportion of an individual’s past earnings – in particular to those with lower earnings) and/or by flat-rate
non-contributory pensions which can be either universal or means-tested. The guaranteed minimum levels
for the latter should be a prescribed proportion of the average earnings of a typical unskilled worker, but the
“total of the benefit and other available means … shall be sufficient to maintain the family of the beneficiary
in health and decency” (Convention No. 102, Art. 67(a)).
Recommendation No. 202 completes this framework by calling for the guarantee of basic income security
to all persons in old age, prioritizing those in need and those not covered by existing arrangements. Such a
guarantee would act as a safeguard against poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion in old age, for people
not covered by contributory pension schemes. It is also of high relevance to pensioners whose benefits
are affected by the financial losses suffered by pension funds, whose pensions are not regularly adjusted
to changes in the costs of living, or whose pensions are simply inadequate to secure effective access to
necessary goods and services and allow life in dignity. ILO social security standards thus provide a comprehensive set of references and a framework for the establishment, development and maintenance of old-age
pension systems at national level.
An important social policy challenge facing ageing societies is to secure an adequate level of income for
all people in old age without overstretching the capacities of younger generations. In view of the financing
and sustainability challenge faced by social security systems in the context of demographic change, the
State has a vital role to play in forecasting the long-term balance between resources and expenditure in
order to guarantee that institutions will meet their obligations towards older persons. The principle in ILO
social security standards, strongly reaffirmed recently by Recommendation No. 202, of the overall and
primary responsibility of the State in this respect will undoubtedly play an important role in how future
governments are held accountable for the sustainability of national social security systems in view of, among
other factors, demographic change.

These regional variations in expenditure levels reflect the prevailing situation in actuality, in which most
older persons in higher-income countries enjoy their
rights to retirement and to income security in old age
(see box 4.1), while in lower-income countries these
rights are given only to a minority.
As clearly stated in Recommendation No.  202,
national social protection floors should guarantee, in
addition to income security, at a minimum “access to
a nationally defined set of goods and services, constituting essential health care” (Part II, Para. 5(a)). This
is particularly important for older persons, not just

to ensure good health, but also because it has a role
in protecting against health-related poverty, given
that older persons generally have greater and specific
health-care needs and may have to rely on long-term
care. This concerns particularly older women, who in
many countries tend to live alone in the later stages of
their lives (Scheil-Adlung and Bonan, 2012). Thus, oldage pensions must be closely coordinated with other
social protection provisions, especially in the areas of
social health protection, long-term care (see box 4.2)
and disability, in order to address the particular needs
of older persons.

Box 4.2  The crisis of the care economy: Risks associated with inattention
to long-term care needs in times of fiscal consolidation 1

80

The need for long-term care is constantly growing as numbers of older persons everywhere increase.
Across the world, at present such care is predominantly provided by relatives, mainly women. However,
this work is often not sufficiently valued and not remunerated adequately, if at all. Over recent years the
situation has become even worse, not only because of demographic ageing, leading to a growing number of
older persons with chronic illnesses, but also because younger women are now more likely to participate in
the labour market and thus less likely to be available for family care.
In the face of these changes in the health profile and lifestyle patterns of families, social protection provisions for long-term care are in many cases inadequate. However, the problem goes far beyond families
and national policies; indeed, it amounts to a global crisis of the care economy. The lack of nurses and
other care professionals to meet the growing need has resulted in an ever-increasing pull of labour from
developing countries into developed countries. It is based on international “labour supply chains” involving
mostly female migrant workers from poor families who provide care services to meet the physical and
emotional needs of older persons. Often the wages, conditions of work and social security coverage of
caregivers in recipient countries are insufficient, with a negative impact on the quality of care, resulting in
discontent on the part of both caregivers and beneficiaries.
Debates are taking place in Thailand, Viet Nam and other countries on how to improve institutional and
home care, often in the hope that volunteer caregivers and self-help groups can play a bigger role and that
demands on public expenditure can be minimized by shifting the financial impact to the private sector (see
e.g. HelpAge International, 2014). Similar approaches are being pursued in India and Singapore, and in
China, where legislation has been implemented that imposes on adult children the responsibility to provide
the care their parents need, under threat of jail or fines if they do not. In other regions of the world, such
as Africa and Latin America, policies are also built on the assumption that private networks – communities
or families – can shoulder the burden of care for older persons, sometimes overlooking limitations in the
capacities of family carers (most of whom are women) and the impacts of such unpaid work on the quality
of care, the income of care families, and the health and future employability of carers. The global inattention to the care needs of older persons reflects broader attitudes towards older persons and can also be
observed in other social protection systems that should both prevent and meet long-term care needs. In
health care, for example, the number of geriatricians is often insufficient to meet the need.
Only few countries have implemented specific schemes providing benefits for long-term care. Most
of these are using tax-based financing, as is the case in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Only a small
number of countries, including Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Taiwan (China), are using social
insurance schemes to cover related costs. Given the complexity of both needs and the schemes in place,
significant “long-term care literacy” is required from older persons when applying for the benefits they
need. These benefits might be in cash – including those for financial support of family carers – or in kind,
such as institutional care and home care. Eligibility criteria vary widely and are frequently means-, ageand needs-tested.
Generally, although public expenditure on long-term care remains very low compared to expenditure
on health and old-age pensions, European Union projections – while admitting uncertainty regarding the
magnitudes of fiscal consequences and considering a number of alternative scenarios – foresee at least a
doubling of current expenditure levels by 2060 (figure 4.6).
Given the limited availability of public resources, all the existing schemes and systems are characterized by a strong reliance on co-payments from both public and private sources. As a result, out-of-pocket
­payments (OOP) for long-term care have a significant impact on the disposable income of older persons:
recent ILO research (Scheil-Adlung and Bonan, 2012) has found that even in European countries OOP on
long-term care amounts on average to 9.6 per cent of older persons’ household income and can be as
much as 25 per cent. The poor, women and the very old are particularly affected. In fact, the very old, aged
80 and over, face OOP up to seven times as high as those of beneficiaries aged between 65 and 79 years.
In this context, given the variable availability of carers and affordability of services, it should be noted that
statistics on OOP include only those who have effective access to such services, and excludes those who
are too poor to purchase such services or cannot obtain them due to the lack of care workers.
  In this report, “fiscal consolidation” refers to the wide array of adjustment measures adopted to reduce government
deficits and debt accumulation. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

The twin objectives of protection are to reach all
older persons in need and to do so at an appropriate
monetary level of benefit provision. The available statistics allow much more detailed analysis of the former
aspect (extent of coverage) than the latter (level of
benefit), even though the assessment of income security
in old age requires at the least consideration of these two
dimensions. In simple terms, the available information
provides some quantitative data by country as well as at
the level of region (or other global grouping) on both
coverage by social security laws and their effective implementation. Effective implementation can be translated
into two distinct measures (and the complementary realities), namely the number of people of working age
actually contributing to a pension scheme (focus on the
contributory side of pension systems) and the proportion
of older persons receiving a pension – either contributory or not – every month, or at least on a regular basis.

4.3 Extent of legal coverage
For most of the world’s population, the right to income
security in old age is unfulfilled, and considerable inequalities persist. Globally, 42.2 per cent of the working-age population is currently potentially covered by
existing laws,6 and will therefore receive an old-age pension once reaching the prescribed age, if these laws are
properly implemented and enforced (see figure 4.7).
Coverage for women is lower than for men: only one
out of three women of working age has some form of
legal coverage. Women’s lower coverage rates for contributory schemes largely reflect their lower labour
market participation rates, their over-representation
among those working as self-employed or unpaid family
workers, or in agriculture or other sectors frequently
not covered by existing legislation, and their higher
likelihood of having shorter and more often interrupted

6  The extent of legal coverage for old age is defined as the proportion of the working-age population (or alternatively the labour force)
covered by law with schemes providing periodic cash benefits once statutory pensionable age or other eligible age is reached. The population
covered is estimated by using the available demographic, employment and other statistics to quantify the size of the groups covered as
specified in the national legislation. Actual, effective coverage is often significantly lower than legal coverage where laws are not implemented
fully or enforced. For additional details, see the glossary in Annex I, as well as Annex II.

careers in formal employment, which constrains their
ability to contribute to social insurance (or other forms
of pension insurance). Women whose husbands were
covered by contributory schemes are in many countries entitled to survivors’ pensions which often become
their only source of income.
Overall, levels of legal coverage (mandatory and
voluntary coverage taken together) range from about
30 per cent in Asia and the Pacific and 32.8 per cent
in Africa – where informality and “unorganized sectors” predominate – to 76.4 per cent in North America
and over 80 per cent in both Western and Central and
Eastern Europe. Globally, 31.5 per cent of the workingage population is mandatorily covered by law and may
receive in future old-age pensions from contributory
schemes, and just over 4 per cent may become eligible to receive a non-contributory pension.7 The corresponding rates of legal coverage for women are lower
(26.4 per cent being covered by mandatory contributory schemes, and an additional 5 per cent potentially
covered by universal or pension-tested non-contributory schemes). In addition, national laws may provide
for voluntary coverage complementing the mandatory
provisions.

4.4 Extent of effective coverage
Indicators of the extent of effective coverage attempt
to measure the extent to which the existing statutory
framework is actually implemented. Figure 4.8 presents
global results for two (or rather three) parallel measures
of effective coverage. The first measure (“beneficiary
coverage ratio”) shows the percentage of older persons
above statutory pensionable age receiving contributory or non-contributory pensions. Focusing on contributory pensions, the second measure (“contributor
coverage ratio”), in its two variants, provides some indication of future pension coverage: it shows the percentages of, respectively, those who are economically
active (“contributor/labour force coverage ratio”) and
those of working age (“contributor/population coverage
ratio”) who contribute to existing contributory pension
schemes.

7  The estimation method adopted tends to underestimate potential legal coverage by non-contributory pension schemes.

4.4.1 Income security in old age:
A right still unfulfilled for many
On a global scale, only slightly more than half of older
persons above statutory pensionable age (51.5 per cent)
receive an old-age pension (i.e. periodic cash benefits),8
and if China is excluded the proportion falls to 45.6 per
cent (see box 4.3).9 Despite an impressive extension of
pension coverage in many countries (see below), significant inequalities persist. In sub-Saharan Africa, less
than one in five older persons (16.9 per cent) receives an
old-age pension which would provide him or her with
a certain level of income security during old age. In
the Middle East, 29.5 per cent of older persons receive
a pension; the figure is 36.7 per cent in North Africa,
47.0 per cent in Asia and the Pacific (32.4 per cent excluding China), and 56.1 per cent in Latin America and
the Caribbean. Regional coverage ratios of more than
90 per cent of older persons are achieved only in North
America and Europe.

The contributor coverage ratio gives an indication
of the proportion of the population – or the labour
force – which will have access to contributory pensions in the future. Although this measure does not
reflect access to non-contributory pensions, it still gives
an important signal regarding future levels of coverage, taking into account that benefit levels in contributory pension schemes tend to be higher than those
from non-contributory pension schemes. At the global
level, less than one-third of the working-age population
(30.9 per cent), just more than a quarter (25.4 per cent)
excluding China, is contributing to a pension scheme
(see figure 4.8). Effective coverage ratios range from
5.9 per cent of the working-age population in sub-­
Saharan Africa to 77.5 per cent of the working-age
population in North America.
Focusing on those persons who are economically
active, 41.4 per cent of the global labour force contribute to a pension insurance scheme, and can therefore expect to receive a contributory pension upon

8  Weighted by total population.
9  As the available data for many countries do not allow for a detailed age breakdown of old-age pensioners, the indicator is calculated as the
total number of beneficiaries of old-age pensions as a proportion of the population above statutory pensionable age.

Box 4.3  Extension of social protection of older persons in China

84

Before 2009, only two institutional mechanisms for income security in old age existed in China: one for
urban workers, based on social insurance principles, and one for civil servants and others of similar status,
based on the employer’s liability approach. Together, they covered under 250 million people (including
pensioners), about 23 per cent of the population aged 15 and above in 2008.
In 2009 and 2011, two new old-age pension schemes were introduced for the rural population and
urban residents otherwise not covered respectively. Participation is voluntary. To encourage people to join,
the Government employed a number of measures, including contribution subsidies and immediate pension payments to the elderly parents of adults registered with a rural pension scheme. Pensions consist
of two components: a social pension paid by the Government, and an individual savings account pension
financed jointly by contributions from the insured persons, collective entities (if any) and the Government.
A minimum level is set for the social pension, which can be higher if local governments so wish and are able
to fund it: this provision partially explains the differences in the levels of pension payments across different
regions. For contributions to the individual savings account, a minimum level of subsidy from the Government is fixed, and personal contribution scales are established to allow each of the insured to choose the
level of contribution he or she wants to make.
At the end of 2013, 850 million people, nearly 75 per cent of the population aged 15 and above, were
covered under the four pension schemes, of which 498 million were covered under the two new schemes,
accounting for 59 per cent of the total number covered.
Essential expansion has also been made within the pension system for urban workers, in particular to
cover rural-to-urban migrant workers, the overall number of whom exceeded 260 million in 2012.
To consolidate the progress achieved so far and to address issues of adequacy, equality, portability
and sustainability in a more coherent, effective and efficient manner, in 2013 China began the process of
overhauling the entire old-age pension system, now comprising the four components outlined above. The
first outcomes of this review include the policies announced in early 2014 on the merging of the two new
pension schemes to equalize their rights and opportunities; the portability of pension entitlements between
the merged scheme and others; and the conversion of employers’ liability for civil servants into a social
insurance pension scheme.

retirement. Owing to the high proportion of informal
employment in sub-Saharan Africa, only 8.4 per cent of
the labour force contributes to pension insurance and
earns rights to a contributory pension. In Asia and the
Pacific, about one-third of the labour force (34.0 per
cent) contributes; coverage ratios are slightly higher in
the Middle East (37.1 per cent), Latin America and the
Caribbean (38 per cent), and North Africa (47.4 per
cent). Western Europe and North America reach coverage rates of 89.2 and 98.5 per cent respectively, followed
by Central and Eastern Europe with 69.7 per cent of
the labour force.
In lower-income countries, usually only a very small
proportion of those employed are wage and salary
earners with formal employment contracts, and are
thus relatively easily covered by contributory pensions.
Informality, evasion and inadequate enforcement of
laws are also more prevalent in lower-income countries. That is why effective pension coverage seems to
be strongly associated with a country’s income level
(see figure 4.9), although it is in fact labour market
structures and law enforcement and governance that

actually exert the crucial influence. While in highincome economies, 90.8 per cent of the labour force
contribute to a pension scheme, this is the case for
only 50.7 per cent in upper-middle-income economies,
15.2 per cent in lower-middle-income economies, and
only 5.7 per cent in low-income economies. These low
coverage ratios tend to be associated with a low degree
of formality in the labour market. Unless effective
non-contributory pensions are available, coverage gaps
also show in the proportion of older persons effectively
benefiting from a pension: beneficiary coverage ratios
range from 18.1 per cent in low-income economies
and 24.1 per cent in lower-middle-income economies
to 71.0 per cent in upper-middle-income economies
and 89.1 per cent in high-income economies.
With efforts to extend contributory schemes to all
with some contributory capacity, and with the introduction of non-contributory pensions in a larger number of
countries, coverage has been extended significantly to
workers in informal employment, providing at least a
minimum of income security in old age. These trends
will be assessed in more detail in the following section.

4.4.2 Changes in pension coverage across
the world: Progress and regression
Although effective pension coverage ratios are still
insufficient, significant progress has been achieved
in recent years. Whereas in 2000, only 34 countries
reached high coverage of more than 90 per cent of the
population above statutory pensionable age, 45 countries fell into this category in 2010–12 (see figures 4.10
and 4.11). At the opposite end of the scale, those countries where pension provision reaches less than 20 per
cent of older persons numbered 57, according to the
more recent data, as compared with 73 countries in
2000. Overall, the data indicate visible improvement
in coverage.
Many countries experienced a significant increase in
coverage between 2000 and 2010. Bolivia increased the
proportion of older persons receiving a pension from
80.7 to 90.5 per cent between 2000 and 2009, largely
due to the reform of its Renta Dignidad programme,
which replaced the Bonosol scheme in 2008. Lesotho’s
pension-tested old-age pension scheme, launched in
2004, now provides a pension to all people above the
age of 70, a benefit available to only 8.4 per cent of
older persons in 2000. Timor-Leste’s universal Support
Allowance for the Elderly, introduced in 2008, steeply
increased coverage rates from 0.5 per cent to 100 per
cent of people aged 60 and older between 2000 and
2011. The introduction of the pension-tested Old Age
Grant in Swaziland in 2005 expanded coverage among

people aged 60 and older from 1.8 per cent in 2000 to
96.3 per cent in 2010. By expanding the old-age allowance (introduced in 1993) to all those not in receipt
of other pensions in 2009, Thailand increased coverage ratios from 5 per cent in 2000 to 81.7 per cent of
people aged 60 and above in 2011. By lowering the
age threshold of its Old Age Allowance (introduced in
1995) in 2008, Nepal increased its coverage ratio from
33 per cent to 62.5 per cent of people aged 58 and over
between 2000 and 2010. China, after increasing potential future pension coverage from 24.4 per cent to
74.4 per cent of the population over statutory pensionable age between 2000 and 2011, planned to extend
its pension system further towards universal coverage
with the decision in 2012 to expand the “new” rural
pension scheme piloted in 2009 and the pilot social
pension insurance for urban residents launched in
2011 to all counties, aiming at nearly doubling statutory pension insurance coverage by the end of 2015
(see box 4.3). Tunisia improved pension coverage for
the self-employed, domestic workers, farmers, fishers
and other low-income groups in 2002, helping to increase the proportion of pension beneficiaries among
people aged 60 and over from 33.9 per cent in 2000
to 68.8 per cent in 2006. In many countries, the extension of coverage was made possible mainly through
the establishment or extension of non-contributory
pension schemes which provide at least a basic level of
protection for many older persons, while others have
combined the expansion of contributory schemes to

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

previously uncovered groups of the population with
other measures.10
The impressive extension of pension coverage in
some parts of the world contrasts with a contraction
in others between 2000 and 2010 (see figure 4.11).
The latter include several countries, including Albania,
Azerbaijan and Greece, which had previously achieved
coverage rates close to 90 per cent or higher in 2000,
and which suffered a significant decrease thereafter.
4.4.3 Persistent inequalities in access
to income security in old age

88

Access to income security in old age is closely associated with existing inequalities in the labour market
and in employment. Such inequalities become evident
from examination of a disaggregation of coverage rates
by gender and by area of residence (rural/urban), which
are the focus of this section (see figures 4.12 and 4.13).11
Older women tend to face higher risk of poverty
than men. There are many underlying reasons for this,
not least the fact that the greater longevity of women results in predominance at the oldest ages of women with
poor levels of support and livelihood (UNFPA and
HelpAge International, 2012; UNRISD, 2010). This is
because pension systems in many countries fail to meet
the needs of men and women equitably: contributory
pension coverage of women tends to be significantly
lower than men’s, and the amounts received by women
on average tend to be lower (Razavi et al., 2012). While
these inequities may be partly due to the gender-biased
design of pension schemes (e.g. lower pensionable age
for women, or the application of sex-specific mortality
tables to calculate benefit levels which result in women
receiving lower pensions than men with the same contribution record and retirement age), in many cases a
more significant driver of gender inequality is found in
the interaction between the results of discrimination
against women in the labour market and the design
of pension schemes, which does not compensate for
differences deriving from labour market conditions
and sometimes even magnifies them (Behrendt and
Woodall, forthcoming). The fundamental problem is

that for many women it is not possible to accrue pension rights on an equal basis with their male counterparts. Women’s share in wage employment, particularly
in formal wage employment, has historically been lower
than men’s and continues to be so in many part of the
world (ILO, 2012d). Also, women who work in wage
employment systematically earn less than men (ILO,
2014c), which also affects the level of their contributions to contributory pension schemes. As women tend
to take on a greater share of family responsibilities, they
are more likely to shorten or interrupt their employment careers, and face a higher risk of working in precarious and informal employment, which also affects
their ability to build up pension entitlements. These
factors lead to relatively low pension benefits where
these are calculated on an earnings-related basis, unless
effective measures are put in place to compensate for
gender inequalities. Non-contributory pensions can
play a key role in ensuring women’s access to at least a
basic pension, yet benefit levels are often not sufficient
to fully meet their needs.
It is clear, too, that closing the gap in pension provision between women and men is closely linked to
the issue of providing equitably for rural and urban
residents (see figures 4.12 and 4.13). In many parts of
the world, women are disproportionately represented
among the rural population, where paid work, even if
available, is likely to be relatively poorly paid, informal
and insecure – reflecting, in part at least, the movement
of men to cities in search of better-paid work at the
more formalized end of the labour market spectrum.
At the same time, the growing importance of non-contributory pensions in the provision of old-age income
is clearly helping to bridge the coverage gap between
men and women to some extent. For instance, in Cabo
Verde, 41.4 per cent of women above retirement age
are receiving the non-contributory pension (31.6 per
cent of men); the proportions in rural areas are respectively 53.6 and 42.1 per cent. At the same time, women
are less likely than men to receive a contributory pension (11.4 per cent compared to 28.2 per cent), especially in rural areas (8 per cent of women and 22.2 per
cent of men).12 In the case of the Plurinational State of
Bolivia, the proportion of older women receiving the

10  While the extension of coverage constitutes significant progress towards guaranteeing at least a basic level of income security for older
persons, a remaining challenge is ensuring the adequacy of pension levels (see below).
11  As part of the research undertaken to prepare this report, the Social Protection Department of the ILO produced a separate study on
social protection for rural women, which includes more detailed discussion of their pension coverage and will be published separately.

in pension coverage. There are efforts everywhere to
expand the effective coverage of contributory schemes
to at least some categories of self-employed and other
workers with contributory capacity.14 Measures to
extend the coverage of contributory schemes to agricultural and rural workers in some countries (e.g. Brazil)
have contributed to a further narrowing of the rural–
urban gap in pension coverage, although significant
inequalities persist. In addition, the establishment of
large-scale non-contributory pension schemes in many
countries has expanded the effective coverage and reduced inequalities, both between the genders and
between rural and urban populations.
Gender equality considerations are gaining some
ground in the public debate on pensions. Proactive
policy measures have been implemented in some countries to reduce the effect of differentiated career patterns on old-age income security. The most obvious
discriminatory elements and parameters of national
pension schemes, such as the differential pension ages
which were common until recently, are rapidly being
eliminated, albeit in the context of general increases in
pension ages for both women and men.
Other steps in the same direction include crediting pension accounts during maternity, paternity and
parental leave, and a better recognition of care work
undertaken by both women and men. Measures to facilitate a more equal sharing of care responsibilities
between women and men contribute to addressing
some of the inequalities in the labour market and in
social protection more broadly, and may be reflected
in a reduction of gender inequalities in labour markets
and pension systems in the long run.15
As with so many other aspects of social protection,
those relating to the promotion of equitable treatment
of women and men must, if they are to be addressed
effectively and in a spirit of social justice, be dealt with
on a basis which fully integrates labour market and
social protection policy-making.

4.5 The adequacy of pensions to provide
genuine income security to older persons
In any society, what kind of retirement provisions are
considered adequate depends on the prevailing attitudes on such matters as the distribution of responsibility between individuals and the State, redistribution
and the support to be provided to the poor and vulnerable, and intergenerational solidarity. At what age retirement happens, what level of income security should
be guaranteed and to whom, what degree of intergenerational solidarity should be expected in financing pensions – these are the issues which are usually agreed as
underpinning partially implicit and partially explicit
social contracts. These social contracts, and the attitudes behind them, evolve over time as social, cultural,
demographic and economic conditions change. They
are also reflected in international labour standards or
human rights instruments.
4.5.1 Guaranteeing income replacement
Any attempt to make a comparative assessment of the
performance of national pension systems in meeting
their relevant objectives today is beset by many complications. The first is that it is very hard to find a comparable benchmark. One possible solution is to compare
the average level of pensions received to the average level
of earnings in the economy, as a national snapshot at a
given point in time of the relative income situation of
pensioners compared to the situation of the employed
population. Unfortunately, while the data necessary for
such a comparison are available and widely presented
in various OECD and EU reports, it is still practically
impossible to replicate the exercise on a wider scale for
countries outside these groups, mainly due to lack of
comparable earnings statistics as well as the limited
availability of the household survey data that would
enable such comparisons.16
Such estimates of income replacement rates provided by pension schemes after retirement are, however, important measures of the degree to which those

14  Opening up the legal opportunity to contribute on a voluntary basis (as, for example, has been done in Indonesia, Mongolia, Thailand
and Viet Nam, and in some countries in other regions of the world) does not in itself necessarily secure an effective increase in coverage. To
ensure this, additional measures are necessary, including subsidizing the contributions of those with low incomes.
15  For example, in the case of parental leave, measures to encourage a greater engagement of fathers (e.g. in Sweden or Germany) in sharing
care responsibilities can help to reduce discrimination against women in the labour market, which may have a long-term effect on gender
inequalities in access to adequate pensions.
16  Also, such an indicator has a very narrow interpretation in countries where wage earners in the formal economy form only a minority of
the population, and thus average wage levels have a very weak relationship with the much lower average household income.

Contents

4. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

schemes provide adequate benefits for those covered by
them (see box 4.4). Other indicators may relate pension
amounts to average household incomes, to GDP per
capita or to poverty lines. The problem is that, while
they may be useful in analysing the adequacy of pension systems within the respective countries, and in
comparing the quality of coverage of different groups
provided by different schemes, they are not comparable
between countries with different extents and patterns
of coverage. For this reason, and owing to the limitations in data availability, this report does not include
global or regional estimates of the replacement rates
and other aspects of quality of pension coverage beyond
the OECD.17

Table 4.1 Indexation methods

4.5.2 Preventing erosion of the value of pensions
over time: Ensuring regular adjustments

While wage indexation was more popular in the
past, nowadays more and more schemes guarantee at
the best only increases in line with cost of living increases. The choice of an indexation method may
appear to be a technical detail, but can have a significant impact on the level of pensions, and as a consequence, expenditure on pensions. Where wages increase
faster than prices, the change from wage-based indexation to price-based indexation offers significant reductions in pension expenditure, but also leads to the
decoupling of pensioners’ living standards from those of
the working population. The evolution of indexation in
Hungary can be taken as an example of a more general
trend: in the 1990s indexation of pensions moved from
wage indexation to a 50:50 mix of price and wage indices, and recently during the crisis was shifted further to
pure wage indexation. Other countries have changed
their indexation policy for pensions in payment in a
less generous direction: Finland (from 50:50 between
earnings and prices to 80 per cent prices and 20 per
cent earnings), France (wages to prices), Poland (various
changes, most recently from 20:80 earnings:prices to
100 per cent prices) and Slovakia (100 per cent wages to
50:50 wages and prices) (OECD, 2012a, p. 58). Spain
decided in 2013 to delink pension adjustment from any
standard of living indices and will not allow benefit
­adjustments higher than 0.25 per cent per annum for a
certain time.

As old-age pensions are drawn for many years after they
are initially calculated and awarded, the questions of
what happens over the years to their purchasing power
and real value, how much those retired have to reduce
their standards of living the longer they live after the
moment of retirement, what their income position is
relative to other groups of the society, and what are the
risks of their falling into poverty, are extremely important. Mechanisms to protect the value of pensions in
payment through more or less regular pension increases
are sometimes referred to as “cost-of-living” adjustments
or indexation, and how this is done effects greatly the
standard of living of long-term pensioners.
Conventions Nos 102 and 128 both call for levels of
benefits in payment to be reviewed following substantial changes in levels of earnings or of costs of living,
while Recommendation No. 131 explicitly stipulates
that benefit levels should be periodically adjusted taking
into account changes in the general level of earnings
or costs of living. Recommendation No. 202 requires
social protection floor guarantee levels to be reviewed
regularly through a transparent procedure that is established by national laws, regulations or practice.
The practice of indexation varies across countries
and schemes, as shown in table 4.1.

17  The OECD in collaboration with the World Bank has made some attempts to calculate replacement indicators beyond EU and OECD
countries, specifically regarding replacement rates provided by pension systems in different countries for hypothetical individuals with
different levels of earnings and contributory past service (see Whitehouse, 2012); however, these are not yet included in the World Bank
Pension Database. HelpAge’s Global AgeWatch Index (HelpAge International, 2013) looks at the overall income situation of older people,
not specifically at the levels of protection provided by existing pension systems. Within the AgeWatch Index, income security of older
persons is measured by three indicators: percentage of older persons receiving pensions, relative poverty rates of the elderly, and relative
income position of the elderly (average incomes of those over 60 as a proportion of average incomes of the rest of the population).

Other schemes, including many in Africa, have provided at the best only occasional, ad hoc increases. This
results, particularly in inflationary environments, in a
majority of pensioners eventually receiving only a min­
imal pension, and many of them falling into poverty
even though before retirement they were high-earning
professionals.
Figure 4.14 shows how pensions in payment lose
their relative purchasing power if not increased at
the same rate as wages under conditions of real wage
growth (assuming moderate real wage growth of 2 per
cent and inflation of only 2 per cent18).
Reducing the frequency of adjustments, or suspending them totally, severely and immediately affects the
standard of living of pensioners and their families.
Unless pensions are adjusted in line with increases
in real wages or some other measure of overall living
standards, the further men and women are beyond the
moment of retirement, the larger the gap between their
living standards and those of people who are still economically active. This widening gap may exacerbate
the economic and social exclusion of older persons as it
may mean, among other things, that they cannot afford
18  In many countries, rates of inflation are much higher
than this and, as a result, the erosion of pensions’ absolute
purchasing power progresses much faster in the absence of
regular and adequate indexation. In some countries, the
majority of beneficiaries receive pensions at the minimum
pension level a few years after retirement.

Box 4.4  Trends in replacement rates
and adequacy of pension payments
One of the great achievements of pension policies in
many European countries and in some other parts
of the world in the years following the Second World
War was to dramatically reduce poverty in old age.
However, recent developments in the labour market,
as well as some policy reforms, increase the risk of a
resurgence of old-age poverty.
While most countries protected the income of
older persons relatively well during the recent crisis,
there are exceptions. Countries that either continuously adjust pensions (including the lowest ones) at
a significantly lower rate than the increase in wages
or average incomes (e.g. Poland, where pensions are
adjusted at only 20 per cent of real wage growth) or
suspend pension adjustments (as Sweden did during
the crisis as a result of its automatic balancing mechanism) experienced an increase in relative poverty of
their older populations. Between 2005 and 2012,
poverty rates among retired people increased from
10 to 18 per cent in Sweden and from 7 to 14 per
cent in Poland.
This trend may spread in the future to other countries as well. Many pension reforms undertaken to
stabilize future costs of pension systems will result in much lower benefits. Figure 4.15 presents
changes in future replacement rates of public pension schemes in EU countries. In some countries
the expected decrease in replacement rate is very
significant. In addition, as many reforms removed redistributive mechanisms from contributory schemes,
these lower replacement rates will apply also to those
with low earnings throughout their working lives.
According to Eurostat, in 2010 17 per cent of employees in the EU (over 21 per cent of women and
over 13 per cent of men) had earnings below the
“low-earnings” threshold (defined as two-thirds of
median earnings). The highest proportions of lowwage-earners were in Latvia (27.8 per cent), Lithuania (27.2 per cent), Romania (25.6 per cent), Poland
(24.2 per cent) and Estonia (23.8 per cent), while the
lowest were in Sweden (2.5 per cent, Finland (5.9 per
cent), France (6.1 per cent), Belgium (6.4 per cent)
and Denmark (7.7 per cent).1
What minimum replacement rates would guarantee those low-wage-earners a future pension income above the poverty line? As figure 4.16 shows,
countries would need to provide replacement rates
of between 50 and 90 per cent of previous earnings to prevent poverty in old age for those on lowincomes.
In what are often considered “old-fashioned”
defined-benefit social security pension schemes, redistributive benefit formulas (usually with a flat rate
component or equivalent) used to guarantee such
higher replacement rates for low-wage-earners. "

4. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

Today, many countries have removed those redistributive formulas when introducing either defined-contribution or notional defined contribution (NDC) components or converting defined-benefit schemes into
purely earnings-related schemes. In this situation, securing a sufficient level of benefits for low-paid workers
would require strengthening minimum benefit provisions, by means including various forms of non-contributory minimum income guarantees.

to access new, modern technologies and new goods
and services changing the lives of more affluent groups
in society. In cases where pensions are not even fully
adjusted to inflation – which is quite common globally – the absolute purchasing power of older persons
deteriorates and they are pushed into poverty.
The effects of incomplete adjustments of pensions
that prevent older persons from keeping up with rising
overall living standards are rendered more dramatic by
the technological advances in health care that everywhere are pushing up its costs, and the costs of related
goods and services, at a faster pace than average inflation – while at the same time, with increasing age the
need for more (and more sophisticated) health care and
related services increases dramatically. As older persons
in many countries have to pay a substantial proportion of the costs of health care and other care services
out of their own pockets, many of them are at grave
risk of either exclusion from access to the health care
they need or financial ruin for themselves and their
families.
Nonetheless, as suspending or delaying indexation
of benefits brings immediate and significant reductions
in public spending, in particular in demographically
“old” countries with matured pension systems and large
numbers of pensioners, it is often seen and used by governments as one of the instruments to contain public
spending. The OECD noted that “governments frequently override indexation rules … in a pro-cyclical
way: pension increases are larger than the rules require
when the public finances are healthy while increases
are postponed or reduced in times of fiscal constraint”
(OECD, 2012a, pp. 59–60). Several countries (including Canada, Germany, Japan, Portugal and Sweden)
have explicitly linked indexation to certain indicators
of sustainability. The problem is that – as became clear
during the recent economic and financial crisis – such
mechanisms may result even in absolute benefit cuts in
times of crisis.

4.6 Reforming and re-reforming
pension systems
ILO social security standards provide guidelines respecting different dimensions of benefit adequacy (age
of eligibility and other entitlement conditions, benefit
levels and protection of purchasing power) and at the
same time require careful monitoring of the longterm financial situation of pension schemes through
actuarial valuations undertaken both regularly and

whenever any important parameters of the scheme
change. Policy decisions to adjust and reform schemes
and systems are, however, left to governments and
their social partners.
Unfortunately, practice in many countries shows
that even if actuarial valuations are undertaken on a
regular basis and lead to recommendations for reform,
actual reforms are often significantly delayed or do
not happen at all. One of the main reasons for this
is that while decisions on pension systems have a very
long-term character and affect not only living but also
future generations, politicians taking these decisions
have much shorter time horizons within the electoral
cycle. In addition, there is always the temptation to use
pension fund reserves – both public and private – as a
kind of “piggy bank”, which can be raided – as experience in many countries over recent years shows – to
repair the public finances or bail out the private sector
(Casey, 2014). Use of pension fund reserves for purposes other than financing current and future pensions
is proof of bad governance and should not be taking
place.
There are, however, many countries where effective
solutions were found which allow the adequacy and
sustainability of pension systems to be held in balance
through democratic policy dialogues well informed
by independent expertise, and where reforms are implemented with a broad consensus across the political
spectrum and spanning different interests, guaranteeing long-lasting effects. There is no recipe to be identified which would work in every country; each country
has to find a solution which fits its specific social and
political environment. There are many studies by the
ILO and others analysing different solutions and processes and identifying good practice as well as problems and challenges (e.g. Eurofound, 2013; Sarfati and
­Ghellab, 2012; Ghellab, Varela and Woodall, 2011;
Reynaud, 2000).
Conversely, in many countries in Europe and elsewhere over recent decades the balance between adequacy and sustainability concerns was endangered.
Assertions of a “social security crisis” or “old-age crisis”
have been used as a justification to introduce reforms
which substantially reduce the future adequacy of
benefits and significantly increase the risk of poverty
in old age for future generations of retirees (see European Commission, 2012d; OECD, 2013a). Pressures
of tax competition and global financial markets limit
governments’ ostensibly sovereign power to introduce
increases in social security contributions and taxes
where necessary to prevent benefit cuts. Lobbying by

4. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

the international financial services sector was successful in pushing for large-scale privatizations of social
security pensions (Hagemejer and Scholz, 2004; Hagemejer, 2005) – though these were reversed in a number
of countries in the wake of the financial and economic
crisis (see box 4.5). Social dialogue mechanisms failed in
a number of cases to reach a consensus with the social
partners on how and to what extent to bring about increases in the (effective average) age at which individuals
start to draw pension benefits, and on how labour markets should be reorganized and regulated so as to better
meet the needs of increasing numbers of those older
persons who wish to, or indeed need to, continue in
employment to significantly greater ages than previously considered appropriate.
These failures to agree on necessary reforms through
social dialogue and implement them through well-informed and deliberate policy-making has led many
countries to adopt too readily a “hands-off” approach
to their governance of the pension system (Woodall
and Hagemejer, 2009), through partial privatization
but also through various “automatic balancing mechanisms”. These include linking accrual rates used to
calculate pensions in social security schemes automatically to life expectancy at retirement (as in countries
which introduced NDC schemes, but also in Brazil in
the case of early-retirement pensions, as well as in many
other countries), or automatically linking the age of
pension eligibility to life expectancy (as in Denmark,
France, Greece and Italy). This took most extreme form
in Sweden, where changes in value of one indicator
(“balance ratio”) deemed to reflect the long-term financial position of the pension scheme not only affect the
future pension entitlements of contributors, but may
also lead to reductions in the amounts of pension paid
to current pensioners (as happened in the middle of the
financial and economic crisis).
“Solutions” of this kind would automatically, without intervention of policy-makers and without discussions among the social partners, adjust benefit levels,
indexation formulas, retirement ages and numbers of
years of contributions required to receive a full pension, according to certain selected statistical indicators
(linked to life expectancy at retirement or to certain
ratios between revenue or assets of a scheme and its expenditure or liability). One of the ways to achieve such
automatic (downward) adjustments of benefit levels to
the changing demographic and economic conditions is
to expand the defined contribution components of pension systems, as has happened in many countries across
the world. Such “automatic pilots” are however also

built in into “notional” defined-contribution schemes
in countries including Italy, Latvia, Norway, Poland
and in particular Sweden, where the “automatic balancing mechanism” in addition regulates the pace of
indexation of benefits and the valorization of past contributions. They are also present in the form of various
“sustainability factors” in different “point” schemes
(such as those in Germany and France, and outside
Europe in Canada or Japan). Some countries, including
Denmark, France, Greece and Italy, have linked future
increases in the pensionable age to future changes in life
expectancy.
Most of these automatic mechanisms lead ultimately
to downward adjustments of benefit levels to ensure financial sustainability. In only two OECD countries
(Canada and Germany) are there mechanisms that may
result in an increase of the effective contribution rate
(Di Addio and Whitehouse, 2012). Apart from minimum pension guarantees – where they exist – there are
no similar automatic mechanisms which would adjust
the system to ensure that benefits are adequate. Even
automatic adjustments of benefits in payment to price
changes are reduced or totally eliminated.
These automatic mechanisms focus solely on the
objective of ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of pension systems, while at the same time
trying to sidestep open policy debates and social dialogue, which are seen as obstacles preventing timely
adoption of necessary policy changes. The consequences of this approach are very severe, as the absence
of any corresponding automatic mechanisms to secure
desired levels of adequacy undermines the necessary
balance between adequacy and sustainability concerns.
In addition, in the short term some of these mechanisms cause pro-cyclical change in the amounts of
benefits paid. Joseph Stiglitz drew attention to this
phenomenon in 2009:
When the economy gets weaker, spending on
social protection and unemployment schemes
should automatically go up, helping to stabilize
the economy. However, … one of the sad facts of
the so-called reforms in recent decades is that we
have been weakening these important automatic
stabilizers. The extent of progressivity in tax systems has been lowered, and we have moved from
defined benefit systems to defined contribution
retirement systems, again weakening the automatic stabilizers of the economy and in some
cases converting them into automatic destabilizers
(Stiglitz, 2009, pp. 4–5).

Box 4.5  Re-reforms and “un-privatizations” of pension systems
in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe

96

Between 1981 and 2008, 11 Latin American countries completely or partially privatized their public pay-asyou-go pension systems. Such reforms also spread at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the new
millennium in most of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where a proportion of social security
contributions (in some countries, such as Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, up to one-third) were channelled
out of public social security pensions into mandatory, privately managed individual accounts. However,
during the past few years these privatizations have come to a halt, and in some countries have been reversed, while public provision was reintroduced or strengthened.
In Chile, where the “new paradigm” was introduced as early as 1981, enough time elapsed to show that
the new system not only did not enhance coverage and compliance as expected but was also unable to
provide adequate income security in old age, especially to those with low earnings and shorter, broken
careers (and in particular to women). Chile was thus also the first country to initiate a re-reform. In 2008
the existing mandatory, privately managed fully funded scheme was complemented by two new public
schemes: a basic universal pension for the 60 per cent of the population on lower incomes without pension
provision (Pensión Básica Solidaria, PBS) and, alternatively, a government-funded supplement to those with
very low pensions (Aporte Previsional Solidario, APS). Moreover, President Bachelet is creating a Public
AFP (pension fund). To reduce the administration costs of the private pension tier, public supervision was
strengthened and greater competition among pension fund administrators was encouraged.
Other countries in the region have also implemented substantial re-reforms of their pension systems:
Argentina in 2008, the Plurinational State of Bolivia in 2010 and Uruguay in 2013. While the first two
countries completely eliminated the private pillar, Uruguay, like Chile, retained it, but improved supervision
and strengthened the public pillar. The main objectives of all these reforms are to improve coverage and
adequacy by expanding (Argentina), universalizing (Plurinational State of Bolivia) or introducing (Chile) noncontributory schemes.
One of the aspects of the re-reforms was to scale down the size of mandatory individual account schemes.
This scaling down has two main objectives: first, to make pensions more secure again, and, second, to ease
the pressure on the public finances from the need to fill the gap in funding for public provision after a
proportion of contributions was channelled into private funds.
Full or partial renationalizations of assets accumulated in mandatory private pension schemes took place
in Argentina and the Plurinational State of Bolivia in Latin America, and elsewhere in Hungary, Kazakhstan
and Poland. A number of countries (including Lithuania, Poland, the Russian Federation, Slovakia and, for
some categories of workers, Uruguay) made the privately managed sector voluntary, allowing people to opt
out and go back to public provision. During the years of the crisis, most countries with mandatory private
pension schemes in Europe either temporarily or permanently reduced or froze the stream of contributions allocated to private pension funds, keeping them for the public system, which was in most cases in
significant deficit.
While the Chilean re-reform was clearly done with the objective of building a floor of protection so that
everybody on reaching old age will have a guarantee of at least minimum income security (an objective that
also played a strong role in the Plurinational State of Bolivia), other countries, in particular those of Central
and Eastern Europe, were to a large extent motivated by public finance concerns, with a view to reducing
budgetary deficits and public debt. In countries such as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, privatization of
social security pensions has been adding about 1.5 per cent of GDP every year to national deficits. As
private pension funds invested most of their assets in bonds issued by governments to cover – among other
things – deficits caused by channelling contributions to private pension funds, one can understand the
radical decisions taken by some governments to stop this circular flow of money which seemed to benefit
only the incomes of private pension administrators. The Polish Government, for example, not only cut contributions to the funded tier from 7.3 per cent to 2.9 per cent of wages and made participation voluntary
(and required current members to reconfirm they want to continue rather than be transferred, with their assets, to the public tier), but in 2014 is transferring all assets kept in government bonds to a social insurance
institution and banning any further investments by the remaining funded tier.

4. Social protection for older women and men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

4.7 Ensuring income security for older
persons: The continuing challenge
Today, the majority of the world’s older persons live in
developing countries, where retirement is a privilege
of public and private sector workers who are fortunate
to work in the formal economy. Globally, the broad
majority of older persons do not benefit from publicly
provided minimum income guarantees, have to work
as long as they are physically able to for their survival,
and have to rely on kinship and charity which are often
insufficient to provide even basic income security. This
situation stands in sharp contrast with the global social
contract embodied in human rights instruments and
international labour standards, under which everybody has a right to at least minimum income security
in old age.
Fortunately, attitudes are changing and are followed
by policy actions: more and more countries across the
world are seeking to expand their contributory pensions
to those who are not currently covered but potentially
have sufficient contributory capacity to participate.
Many countries are also expanding non-contributory
provisions in the form of so-called “social pensions”,
available either universally to all who reach a certain age
threshold or to those who have no or insufficient pension or other income, which provide at least a modest
regular income to older persons.
There are of course questions to be addressed relating to the balance between the adequacy of benefits
and their affordability, and to the long-term financial
and fiscal sustainability of pension schemes. Establishing a pension system is a long-term commitment, and
long-term balances between future benefit costs and
available means of financing have to be regularly monitored (as, indeed, has been explicitly required from the
outset by international labour standards). If people
live longer but pensionable age is not proportionally

adjusted (that is, if the duration of retirement and
of the period during which pensions are received increases relative to the duration of economic activity
and of contributory period), the costs of pensions will
unavoidably increase unless benefit levels are cut.
Affordability depends on the existence of policy
space for the objective of guaranteeing income security in old age: if such space exists (that is, if there is
a political willingness to implement such guarantees),
the way is usually open to create the necessary fiscal
space as well (after assessing the opportunity costs of
allocating resources to this and not to other ends).
However, support for pension financing, the ensuing
policy choices, and the corresponding fiscal space may
erode over time if coverage and benefits cease to be
perceived as adequate and just, or if governance and
delivery fail.
As noted above, the sustainability of pension systems seems to be quite well guarded in many countries. However, what is missing is an equally careful
monitoring of benefit adequacy, and of the social and
economic impacts of ongoing benefit reductions. The
conclusions and recommendations that arise from such
monitoring should feed into policy dialogue involving
all stakeholders, and should also lead to changes in the
application of “automatic pilots” if they put the system
on the wrong track.
Adequacy and sustainability are two sides of the
same coin: promises of generous pensions not balanced
by sustainable financing will never materialize, while,
on the other hand, if a low-cost pension system is not
accepted as adequate, the willingness to pay the taxes
and contributions necessary to finance it will erode.
What is needed vmeasures that ensure a genuine balance between adequacy and sustainability – a balance
which can only be achieved through real and democratic social dialogue resulting in a renewed and reinvigorated social contract on pensions.

Towards universal
coverage in health

Contents

KEY MESSAGES
nn The ILO’s pioneering role in the foundation of universal coverage in health protection dates
back to 1944, when the Declaration of Philadelphia and the Medical Care Recommendation,
1944 (No. 69), were adopted. Most recently, the ILO was requested, along with the WHO and
other UN agencies, to give high priority to working jointly towards universal health coverage,
and towards the associated goal of establishing social protection floors, by the UN General
Assembly.
nn The urgency of striving for universal coverage in health is illustrated by the fact that more
than 90 per cent of the population living in low-income countries remains without any right
to coverage in health. Globally, about 39 per cent of the population is lacking such coverage.
As a result, about 40 per cent of global health expenditure is shouldered directly by the sick.
nn Despite coverage, health care is frequently neither available nor affordable, and access to
needed services can lead to poverty. As a result, much of the coverage that exists is illusory.
Often, even people who are legally covered experience limited health benefits, high out-ofpocket payments and a lack of the health workers needed to deliver services.
nn The ILO estimates that there is a global shortfall of 10.3 million health workers required to
ensure that all in need receive quality health services. This gap, and the often close-to-poverty
wages of health workers, are blocking progress towards universal health coverage.
nn Globally, 88 countries in all regions have proved that it is possible to close the gaps in health
coverage. Many of them began the process of reform at lower levels of national income and
invested in times of economic crisis. Further, they have shown that countries can achieve high
coverage rates and even universal coverage irrespective of the financing mechanisms chosen.
nn Investing in health protection, including paid sick leave, yields returns. However, public
expenditure on health protection is at present too low to be sufficiently effective: the potential economic returns from increased productivity and employment cannot be realized while
gaps in coverage persist. Closing these gaps would lead to the highest rates of return in the
world’s poorest countries.
nn Fiscal consolidation measures have sharpened inequities in access to health care and increased
exclusion by shifting the burden from the public purse to private households. Further, fiscal
consolidation measures have blocked economic recovery by reducing the effectiveness and
efficiency of health protection.
nn Significant investments in health protection and coherent policy approaches across the health,
social and economic sectors are needed to address inequities in access to health care and
realize the potential of health protection as an economic stabilizer.

5.1 The crucial role of universal health
coverage for individuals and the economy
Health coverage, and particularly access to health care
when it is needed, is crucial for human well-being. In
addition, of all the elements of social protection, health
care is most essential to the economy as a whole and to
economic recovery in particular. In developing countries the economic returns on investing in health are
estimated at 24 per cent of economic growth between
2000 and 2011, taking into account increases in both
national income and life years gained (The Lancet
Commission, 2013). The economic impacts of investments in health care may be summarized as follows:

100

•	 development and economic growth, through increased labour productivity; a growing labour force
due to reductions in disability, mortality and life
expectancy; the contribution of the health sector
itself to economic activity; increased household consumption opportunities as a result of reduced outof-pocket expenditure;
•	 productivity increases through reduced absenteeism;
•	 employment effects and job growth arising from the
improved physical capacities of workers and from
both direct employment in the health sector and
multiplier effects in industry, local businesses and
other sectors;
•	 stabilization of the economy in times of crises, by
cushioning the impacts of economic crises on individual health and ensuring continued employment
for those in the health sector and related sectors;
•	 income generation, based on increased ability to
work;
•	 poverty alleviation, through minimizing the private
health expenditure of those who are poor or near to
poverty.
In the longer term, growing tax bases arising from the
indirect economic effects of investments in health will
generate more public funds at national level, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
Against this background, health protection schemes
and systems that are well designed and implemented,
and are embedded in appropriate economic and labour
market policies, have the potential to recover large
parts of their costs at the national level. Thus, both the

(working) population and the economy are beneficiaries of investments in social health protection.

5.2 The foundation of universal
coverage in health in international
labour standards
Given the critical importance of human health both to
individuals and to social and economic development, it
is important that countries and development partners
across the world be aligned in support of the objective of
establishing universal coverage. In recognition of this imperative, health coverage has been at the core of the ILO
mandate since its foundation in 1919 (see box 5.1). The extension of such coverage to all in need has been a priority
since 1944, as stated in the Declaration of ­Philadelphia.
The first formulation of guidance to achieve universal
coverage dates back to the same year, when ILO constituents adopted the Medical Care ­Recommendation, 1944
(No. 69), which states: “The medical care service should
cover all members of the community, whether or not
they are gainfully occupied” (Para. 8).
Since then, this objective and the specific means for
its realization have been spelled out in numerous ILO
Conventions and Recommendations, most recently in
the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012
(No. 202), which emphasizes that in each country, all
residents and children should be guaranteed access to
health care, and that this should include at least essential health care, prevention and maternal care, financed
through social protection systems and schemes so as to
avoid financial access barriers, e.g. through excessive
out-of-pocket payments.
Recommendation No. 202 specifies the need for:
•	 legal health coverage by a health protection system
or scheme, e.g. through entitlements to benefits prescribed by national law; that is, rights-based protection (in contrast to charitable  provision, for
instance) through national health services and/or
national, social or private health insurance schemes
operated in line with certain conditions; and
•	 guaranteed access to at least essential health care that
meets the criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (AAAQ),1 without risk of hardship or increased risk of poverty due to the financial
consequences of gaining such access.

5. Towards universal coverage in health

Box 5.1  Approaching universal coverage in health: Anchored in ILO Conventions and
Recommendations and further international standards
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, 1948) and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1966) set out:
•	 the right to the “highest attainable standard of physical and mental health” (ICESCR, Art. 12(1)) and to “a
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including … medical
care” (UDHR, Art. 25(1));
•	 the right to “social security, including social insurance” (ICESCR, Art. 9), “in the event of … sickness,
disability … or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control” (UDHR, Art. 25(1)); and
•	 the right to “conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of
sickness” (ICESCR, Art. 12(2d)).
Contents

The ILO Medical Care Recommendation, 1944 (No. 69), emphasizes that “medical care service should
cover all members of the community, whether or not they are gainfully occupied” (Para. 8) and provides
comprehensive guidelines for the provision and delivery of medical care, particularly the essential features
of a medical care service, the entitlement of persons covered, as well as the scope, organization, quality,
funding and administration of medical care.
The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), states that medical care needs to
be provided “in respect of a condition requiring medical care of a preventive or curative nature” (Art. 7),
in cases of “morbid condition”, that is, ill health (Art. 8), and in maternity (Art. 8). Medical care benefits
should include:
•	 general practitioner care, including domiciliary visiting;
•	 specialist care at hospitals for inpatients and outpatients, and such specialist care as may be available
outside hospitals;
•	 essential pharmaceutical supplies, as prescribed by medical or other qualified practitioners;
•	 hospitalization where necessary; and,
•	 pre- and post-natal care for pregnancy and childbirth and their consequences, either by medical practitioners or by qualified midwives, and hospitalization where necessary.
The Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130), and its accompanying Recommendation (No. 134), outline a more advanced set of standards for medical care than Convention No. 102,
extending the benefit package to include dental care, medical rehabilitation (prosthetics), medical aids such
as eyeglasses, and services for convalescents. Convention No. 130 also mandates those member States
that have ratified the Convention to increase the number of persons protected, extend the range of medical
care provided and extend the duration of sickness benefit.
The Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), stipulates that national social protection
floors should be established consisting of basic guarantees ensuring at a minimum that, over the life cycle,
all in need have access to essential health care and to basic income security (Paras 4 and 5), including
sickness benefits. According to the Recommendation:
•	 the principles of universality and entitlement to benefits prescribed by national law should apply (Para. 3);
•	 all residents and children should be entitled to “access to a nationally defined set of goods and services,
constituting essential health care, including maternity care, that meets the criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality”, without risk of “hardship and an increased risk of poverty due to the
financial consequences of accessing essential health care” (Paras 5, 6 and 8);
•	 social protection floors should be established by member States with a view to “building comprehensive
social security systems” incorporating “the range and levels of benefits set out in the Social Security
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), or in other ILO social security Conventions and Recommendations setting out more advanced standards” (Para. 17).

101

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

102

Universality of health coverage implies that in
all countries, rights-based approaches, anchored and
framed in legislation, should exist to cover the whole
population, including workers in the formal and informal economy and their families. The implementation
and enforcement of these approaches is a prerequisite
for access to health care when needed.
According to Recommendation No. 202, universal health coverage further requires effective access to
at least essential health care as defined at national level
and also income replacement during periods of sickness, provided equally to all in need. This necessitates
the availability of acceptable quality care, which entails
a sufficient number of skilled health workers for service
delivery and adequate funds e.g. for drugs and infrastructure. In addition, it is necessary that co-payments,
user fees and other costs involved in taking up care are
affordable and that financial protection is provided in
order to avoid hardship or impoverishment. Finally,
effective access requires good governance of schemes
and systems, which should be based on accountability,
including participatory processes such as social and national dialogue.
Thus, the Recommendation defines a concept of
universal coverage in health that entails taking into account both legal coverage and access to health care: only
the combination of both will lead to meaningful protection for the population and ensure equitable access
as a matter of right to services that meet the AAAQ
criteria. The ILO has developed tools and indicators for
measuring the status quo and progress towards universal health coverage on both dimensions.
The notion of universal health coverage was also developed over the years in other UN agencies, particularly the World Health Organization (WHO), which
referred to it in, for example, a resolution of the World
Health Assembly (WHO, 2011b) encouraging countries to aim for universal coverage. Today, the principle
of universal health coverage has gained momentum and
the UN General Assembly has asked the WHO and
other UN agencies, including the ILO, to give high
priority to working jointly towards universal health
coverage in the context of wider approaches to social
protection, in consultation with UN member States
(UN, 2012c).

5.3 Coverage deficits, especially
in low-income countries
The ILO’s work towards establishing universal coverage
in health is supported by specific databases that reveal
health coverage and access deficits. In line with Recommendation No. 202, data have been gathered and
analysed on both key aspects of coverage: legal health
coverage, defined as affiliation to a health system or
scheme and access to health care that meets specific criteria which are measured by proxy indicators.2 While
these data are subject to limitations including reliance
on published secondary data and gaps in availability,
the ILO considers the aggregate data to be reliable.
These data reveal that nearly four-tenths (38.9 per
cent) of the world’s population are without any form of
legal health coverage. The largest coverage gaps are in
Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where some
80 per cent of the population is excluded from legal coverage, and in Asia: for example, in India, more than 80 per
cent of the population is not legally covered (figure 5.1).
In 44 countries across the world more than 80 per
cent of the inhabitants remain without coverage as
they are not affiliated to any health system or scheme
(figure 5.2). These countries include Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras,
India and Nepal.

Further analyses disclose that the most significant
gaps in legal health coverage are found in those countries with the highest poverty levels among the population, whereas the highest coverage rates are achieved in
countries with low poverty levels, such as those of Western Europe (figure 5.3). A close relationship between
coverage rates and income levels of countries is also apparent: the lower a country’s income, the more likely it is
to experience coverage gaps in social health protection.
The global deficit in legal health coverage is compounded by gaps in effective access to health care, as
revealed by the access deficit indicators chosen to assess
performance against the AAAQ criteria, namely the
deficits in the number of health workers needed to deliver services, per capita health spending, OOP and as
indicator for quality and overall health-system outputs
the maternal mortality rate. Related thresholds used
to identify the deficits are based on data from countries that are considered low vulnerability.3 Figure 5.4
provides a comprehensive overview of the situation at
the global level, revealing deficits in effective access to
health care in countries grouped by income level.

The figure shows that across low-income countries:
•	 more than 90 per cent of the population remains
without any legal health coverage to provide access
to the most essential health care;
•	 more than 80 per cent of the population lacks access
to health care due to the absence of health workers
needed to provide such services;4
•	 with OOP accounting for more than 45 per cent of
total health expenditure, the affordability of health
services and financial protection is a grave problem
and financial hardship as a result of private health
expenditure is assumed to be very prevalent.
Significant gaps in the funding of health care are also
apparent in this group of countries. The threshold required to provide quality health care is estimated by
the ILO at US$239 per person per year.5 The current
financial deficit in low-income countries exceeds 90 per
cent of necessary expenditure to cover the costs of at
least essential health care. The global average annual per
capita spending on health is US$948; the country with

the lowest total spending per year on health, Eritrea,
spends just US$12 (WHO, 2012).
The maternal mortality ratio is estimated to be
as high as 37.5 deaths per 10,000 live births in lowincome countries, and is often directly related to gaps
in the availability of skilled health workers, particularly
midwives.

In addition to these deficits in effective access to
health care, it should be noted that in most countries
certain groups, such as the rural population, women,
the elderly, minorities and people with special needs
such as those affected by HIV/AIDS, are even more
likely to face barriers to access than the general population (Scheil-Adlung and Kuhl, 2012).

5. Towards universal coverage in health

Further, when comparing different groups of countries, or different schemes within countries, it is important to be aware that the scope of benefits provided
by the various systems and schemes may vary significantly. Depending on economic, financial, epidemiological and social conditions, the scope of benefits might
range from providing a limited number of public health
and clinical interventions in primary care facilities to
comprehensive benefit packages limited only by the exclusion of some services. Thus figure 5.4 does not reflect the wide disparities in effective access to care both
within and across countries.
In countries characterized by significant coverage and
access deficits, social health protection cannot play the
roles mentioned above in terms of enhancing productivity, employment, income generation and poverty alleviation. Frequently, workers and their families will not be
protected during periods of sickness, jobs and incomes
may be lost due to sickness, and economic downturns
will not be counterbalanced by the positive productivity
and employment impacts of social health protection but
will, on the contrary, be aggravated by its absence.

5.4 Affordability and risk of impoverishment
In nearly all countries throughout the world, OOP
is involved when seeking health care. Such payments
of course are frequent where legal health coverage is

absent, but are also common in countries that have not
fully implemented and enforced existing legislation or
have failed to link eligibility and affordability of health
care when designing health systems and schemes – for
example, if the scope of the benefits provided is too
limited or co-payments, user fees and others costs associated with taking up health care are high. Where OOP
is significant, even to the extent of being impoverishing,
it creates financial barriers preventing access to health
care when needed. In these cases legal health coverage is
an illusion, masking a lack of effective access.
An overview of the extent of legal health coverage,
and OOP, in selected African countries is presented in
figure 5.5. It reveals that in some countries with relatively high legal coverage rates, such as Mauritius and
Egypt, OOP still exceeds 50 per cent of total health
expenditure.
Often, even the most basic care involves OOP.
This includes facility-based maternity care in countries
where most of the population earns less than US$1 a
day: for example, in Kenya, where nearly 100 per cent of
women had to pay fees amounting to more than US$18,
and in Burkina Faso, where 92.5 per cent of women reported paying fees.
Also, when evaluating the impacts of OOP, it
should be kept in mind that those living in poverty
are more often affected by sicknesses incurring higher
OOP than other groups of the population. This is the
case for many non-communicable diseases, such as

chronic conditions often prevalent among older persons, and lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, which
is often due to the unavailability of healthy food at low
prices (FAO, 2004) and the difficulty of taking exercise in the absence of public recreational facilities. As
a result, the poor often suffer from both worse health
and higher OOP than the rich, a combination that frequently results in increased levels of poverty.
In many countries, women are affected more severely than men by OOP; this applies particularly
to poor women, whose health-care needs tend to be
greater than those of men, including those related to
HIV/AIDS, which is more prevalent among women
than men (Scheil-Adlung and Kuhl, 2012).

5.5 Protection from income loss:
The benefits of paid sick leave

106

In addition to protecting against OOP, financial health
protection involves the provision of sickness benefits
that aim to replace loss of income and of sick leave
during periods of ill health. Sickness benefits and sick
leave are crucial to addressing deteriorating health,
health-related poverty and loss of productivity. The
financing mechanisms for paid sick leave are usually
similar to those for health care, involving some form
of taxes, including tax subsidies and contributions/payroll taxes and premiums. In a few countries, specific
employer funds apply. Provisions include both time off
work and wage replacement during sickness.
While paid sick leave legislation exists for
formal sector workers in 145 of about 190 countries

globally, the benefits provided differ widely with regard
to definition of work, wages covered, level of income
replacement, duration of payments and other specific
conditions (table 5.1).
Income replacement rates vary between lump sums
(in 14 per cent of all countries) and 100 per cent of
wages (in 21 per cent of all countries). More than half of
countries provide for replacement rates of between 50
and 75 per cent of wages. The wage replaced also varies,
and may be limited, for example by a ceiling or the exclusion of supplements. The wage replacement might
further be subject to means testing and waiting times.
The period of leave also varies widely: out of a total of
145 countries reviewed, 102 countries provide for one
month or more, while seven provide under seven days
(Scheil-Adlung and Bonnet, 2011).
Where legislation exists, coverage is usually strongly
skewed to formal sector workers. In most countries,
workers in the informal economy are totally excluded
from income replacement during sickness. Even those
who are covered frequently face barriers to accessing
paid sick leave, given the fear of losing their jobs, particularly in times of economic crisis and/or high unemployment (Scheil-Adlung and Sandner, 2010).
In fact, paid sick leave offers ample returns in the
form of gains in health and economic productivity
for employers, workers and the economy at large. Paid
sick leave allows workers to recuperate rapidly, prevents more serious illness and disability developing,
and reduces the spreading of diseases to co-workers
and beyond, whereas working while sick incurs high
economic costs, due to higher number of people to be
treated for more severe signs of ill health (Economist

Intelligence Unit, 2014). Also, the lower productivity of
sick workers has been found to slow down growth and
development; thus the absence of sick leave creates economic costs and avoidable health expenditure (ScheilAdlung and Sandner, 2010).

5.6 Financing mechanisms
for universal coverage in health
Generally, countries that have achieved high health coverage rates have used revenue-collection and risk-pooling
mechanisms, mainly taking the form of state-financed
national health services or contribution-financed national, social or private health insurance schemes.
A schematic overview of financing mechanisms currently in place, showing the various sources and funding flows used for financing health coverage, is provided
in figure 5.6. It distinguishes between the use of government revenues to fund national health services, such
as that in Canada, and other tax-funded programmes,
e.g. maternity vouchers in Kenya or conditional cash

transfers in Nicaragua. In other countries, government
revenues are used to subsidize schemes funded through
income-related contributions, particularly social health
insurance schemes where contributions are made by
both employers and employees (as in Germany and Austria) and national health insurance schemes where the
contributions of those without formal employment are
supported by state subsidies (as in Ghana).
The figure  also includes private direct funding – OOP – as it is found to various extents in all
countries, despite the fact that it should not be considered as a health financing mechanism given its regressive and potentially impoverishing impacts, and the
absence of burden-sharing it implies. Resort to OOP
should be restricted to the provision of cost control incentives only.
Countries that have achieved universal coverage in
health for many decades using tax and contributionbased financing mechanisms include the United Kingdom, with its National Health Service, and Germany,
using a social health insurance scheme. More recently,

Social and national health insurance
Pro
•	 Generates stable revenues
•	 Often strong support from the population given perceived high quality of services
•	 Usually involves tax subsidies – particularly in national health insurance schemes – to cover the poor
and/or other vulnerable groups
•	 Involvement of social partners and voice representation
•	 Redistributes between high- and low-risk and high- and low-income groups in the population covered
Con
•	 Limited to formal sector workers and their families if no subsidies for informal sector workers and
other parts of the population are provided
•	 Payroll contributions can reduce competitiveness and lead to higher unemployment
•	 Complex to manage; governance and accountability may be problematic
•	 Can lead to cost escalation unless effective contracting mechanisms are in place

108

Community-based health insurance
Pro
•	 Can reach out to workers in the informal economy and poorer segments of the population
Con
•	 Coverage usually only extended to a small percentage of the population
•	 Poor may be excluded unless subsidized
•	 May be financially vulnerable if not supported by national subsidies
•	 Strong incentive to adverse selection
•	 May be associated with lack of professionalism in governance and administration
Private commercial health insurance
Pro
•	 Preferable to out-of-pocket expenditure
•	 Increases financial protection and access to health services for those able to pay
•	 Encourages better quality and cost efficiency
Con
•	 High administrative costs
•	 Ineffective in reducing cost pressures on public health systems
•	 Inequitable without subsidized premiums or regulated insurance content and price

of risk-pooling and cross-subsidization. Thus, mixed
mechanisms require close coordination of all schemes
and systems in a country with an overall view to achieving universal coverage.
Countries that have recently made efforts to reduce
coverage gaps and fragmentation include Cambodia,
where some 50 health equity funds now provide access
to free health-care services to more than half of the
country’s poor people; Indonesia, where the Government committed itself to achieving universal coverage
by 2019 through a coordinated approach of contributory and non-contributory schemes; and the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, which is currently implementing a national health insurance merging the existing four fragmented schemes with a view to increasing
risk-pooling and efficiency.
Across all regions, 88 countries have currently
achieved high legal coverage rates of at least 80 per cent
of the population. Some countries achieved universal
coverage in a relatively short period (about ten years in
the case of Thailand) and started reforms at low levels
of national income and during times of economic crisis
(Evans et al., 2012).
As shown in figure 5.7, the majority of countries (45)
that have achieved high legal coverage rates of 80 per
cent or more of the population did so using mainly
state coverage mechanisms, whereas 28 countries used
mainly insurance mechanisms and the remaining 15
countries applied both mechanisms in unspecified
combinations. Analysis of the available information
by region indicates a preference for state mechanisms
among countries with high coverage rates in Asia and
Figure 5.7 Coverage mechanisms used by countries with

financing mechanisms have been implemented successfully: for example, in Thailand various systems and
schemes exist alongside one another, and are well coordinated to avoid fragmentation.
For other countries, achieving universal coverage
required that existing gaps be closed by removing barriers within the health-care system and tackling the
root causes of inequities in access to health care, many
of which reside outside health systems themselves. Key
issues to be addressed within the health sector frequently include gaps in legislation and/or implementation, resulting in fragmentation, inequitable access
due to deficits in financial protection, affordability
of services, and absence of paid sick leave; inadequate
availability of services due to a lack of trained health
personnel, and related low quality of services; and the
underfunding of social health protection. Causes that
lie beyond the health sector often relate to poverty;
the structure of employment and the labour market
(e.g. the prominence of the informal economy); inequities relating to e.g. gender, age, minority status; gaps
in income support through social protection; and individual life circumstances (e.g. migration). If sustainable
progress is to be made in extending health coverage,
both types of issue need to be addressed simultaneously,
with particular attention paid to poverty alleviation
and labour market policies in order to cut the reciprocal relationship of poor health and poverty across the
social, economic and health sectors.
There are positive and negative aspects to each of
the different financing mechanisms outlined here, and
there is no one model that serves all social and economic contexts. Many countries have developed mixed
mechanisms, either within a single scheme – e.g. state
subsidization of contributions for the poor in insurance-based schemes, or introduction of insurance features in a national health service – or by maintaining
State and insurance schemes alongside one another.
The reasons for mixed solutions are often linked to the
desire to generate sufficient funds from different sources
and to make best use of the respective advantages of the
different mechanisms, such as large risk pools, generation of stable revenues, and reaching out to populations in remote areas. An overview of observations on
some key aspects of performance of these coverage and
financing mechanisms is provided in table 5.2.
When developing mixed mechanisms, it is of particular importance to avoid a large number of uncoordinated schemes and systems using different financing
mechanisms for various population groups and providers. Such fragmentation reduces the positive impacts

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

5.7 Levels of public and private
health expenditure
Globally, public expenditure on health protection as
a share of GDP more or less equals private health expenditure. A similar picture can be observed at regional
level, where we find equal public and private shares in
Asia and the Pacific and in Africa, Latin America and
the Caribbean, and the Middle East (figure 5.8). Thus
more than 40 per cent of the global burden of health
expenditure is borne by private households in the form
of OOP. This is an alarming statistic, given that OOP
has the potential to create access barriers, inequities and
impoverishment, and, being regressive in character and
lacking any element of risk-pooling, runs counter to the
key principle of solidarity in financing.
Generally, private OOP is a particularly dominant
source of health-care funding in the poorest countries
of the world, despite its regressive impact on income: In
Africa, private expenditure even exceeds public expenditure and amounts to nearly 3 per cent of GDP.
In fact, there exists a positive correlation between
poverty rates and shares of OOP in total health expenditure: the extent of impoverishing OOP in a country increases with the level of the population living below the
poverty line. In countries where less than 2 per cent of
the population are living on US$2 day, about 20 per
cent of total health expenditure derives from OOP; in
countries where more than 50 per cent of the population are living on US$2 a day, it amounts to around

the Pacific, whereas in Europe, Africa and the Americas
there is approximately equal inclination towards state
and insurance mechanisms.
These data suggest that, given a strong role and
commitment on the part of the Government, countries can achieve high or even universal health coverage irrespective of the coverage mechanism(s) chosen
if the systems and schemes are well designed and the
pros and cons of different mechanisms are balanced
with a view to avoiding fragmentation. More important
than which mechanism is chosen is for the decision to
be taken on the basis of what is most appropriate to
the social, economic, historical and cultural context of
the particular country concerned. Further, it is most
important that the overall and primary responsibility for health coverage lies with the State and is based
on certain key principles, such as solidarity and burden-sharing in financing. Achieving progress in both
legal health coverage and access to health care requires
strong government commitment to regulation to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of health protection schemes and systems. Guidance to governments
in tackling this task is available through various international legal instruments, ranging from the UDHR to
ILO Conventions and Recommendations in the area of
health protection, especially Convention No. 102 and
Recommendation No. 202 (see box 5.1 above).

50 per cent. Thus it is the poorest, who are also the most
in need, who suffer most from OOP and related inequities (figure 5.9).

5.8 The global shortage of health workers
The low level of public health financing is also reflected
in the low number of health workers. Skilled health
workers are the backbone of any health system (Global
Health Workforce Alliance and WHO, 2014): indeed,
professional health staff – physicians, nurses and midwifery personnel as defined by the WHO – are a prerequisite for the delivery of quality care services to those
in need. However, the health workforce is experiencing
a global crisis: it is much too small in numbers to deliver
the services needed, unequally distributed and often
lacking decent working conditions. According to the
latest available data, in numerous countries – including,
for example, Haiti, Niger, Senegal and Sierra Leone – as
many as 10,000 people have to rely on services provided
by five or fewer health workers. By contrast, in a highincome country such as Finland there are 269 health
workers for 10,000 people (table 5.3).
As a result, in many countries health workers are
stretched to their limits and seek jobs elsewhere; this

in turn often further reduces the availability of health
services, especially in rural areas, and contributes to
a “brain drain” of skills and experience. At the global
level, health-worker migration from poorer to richer
countries is constantly increasing: for example, between
2007 and 2012 more than 230,000 migrant health
workers took up job opportunities in health-care services in the United States (OECD, 2013c).
At the same time, pay cuts for civil servants, including health workers, are under consideration in many
countries, both at lower-middle-income level (for example, Mongolia) and also at higher-income level, mainly
to achieve cost savings (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013).
Only a few countries have indicated that they plan
to increase the number of their health workers, ensure
training of existing health workers or improve the important coordination between education, the labour
market and the health sector. However, according to a
recent review of IMF country reports, general increases
in the number of civil servants including health workers
are under consideration in some countries, including
the Central African Republic, Gambia and Mozambique (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013). Timor-Leste aims
to increase its number of medical staff by retaining
trained doctors from Cuba (Asante et al., 2014).
The ILO estimates that 41.1 health workers per
10,000 population are necessary to provide at least essential services to all in need.6 This target is met or exceeded

6  This figure is based on calculations of median value of the density of health workers in countries where socio-economic conditions
and health financing characteristics are conducive to universal coverage. Statistical details of the ILO Access Deficit Indicator and the
assessment of deficits are presented in Annex IV, table B.11.

not only by high-income countries but also by some lowand lower-middle-income countries, including Armenia,
Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Swaziland. However, across
the globe 10.3 million additional health workers are required to close the current gaps and ensure the delivery
of health services to all in need. The majority of these are
needed in developing countries, mainly in Asia (7.1 million) and Africa (2.8 million) (figure 5.10).
Investment in the development of the health workforce is an essential condition of progress towards universal health coverage and addressing the global health
access deficit. Such investment is now timely, given

that the share of total health expenditure devoted to
remuneration of the health workforce has fallen over
the past ten years while other elements of health expenditure have increased significantly (HernandezPena et al., 2013). Furthermore, and most importantly,
such investment has the potential to boost the global
economy, promote equitable economic recovery at national level and generate much-needed decent work at
fair incomes.

5.9 Inadequate levels of pay
for health workers
In the quest for progress in health coverage, the increase
in numbers of health workers must go hand in hand
with the creation of decent working conditions, including adequate wages.
In recent years, the wage bills of health workers
have fallen, sometimes dramatically: in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Myanmar, for example, they
declined by about 40 per cent during economic crises
between 2007 and 2009 (UNICEF, 2010). In fact, the
wages are often so poor that the workers in the lowestpaid categories are faced with the risk of impoverishment: In countries such as Sudan, Egypt and Myanmar,
health-sector wages are only 1 per cent above the poverty line of US$2 a day.7 In other countries, while the
wage bills of health workers were stable in nominal
terms, they declined in real terms as a result of falling
purchasing power.

5. Towards universal coverage in health

Over the first decade of this century, the remuneration of salaried health workers as a proportion of GDP
remained nearly unchanged globally and decreased in
terms of total health expenditure (figure 5.11). In addition, delays in payment are frequent in many countries.
The consequences include absenteeism, requests for informal payments and a brain drain of workers seeking
better wages outside their home countries.

5.10 Fiscal consolidation measures:
Drivers of economic recovery
or part of the problem?
During the recent crisis, only a few countries managed
to increase legal health coverage. Universal health insurance schemes were introduced in Benin and Gabon
(ISSA, 2013b); legal coverage was expanded in the
United States (for young people and those with pre-existing conditions) under the 2010 Affordable Care and
Patient Protection Act, in the Philippines under the
Aquino Health Agenda for Achieving Universal Coverage in 2010, and in China for both urban and rural
residents (SSA and ISSA, 2012; SSA and ISSA, 2013a).
Other countries, such as Uruguay, aimed at both expanding coverage and also reducing fragmentation and
segmentation (EsSalud and ILO, 2013).
At the same time, many countries implemented
fiscal consolidation measures,8 with the aim of achieving economic recovery primarily through the reduction
of fiscal deficits. Among these measures were structural
reforms and quantitative adjustments in the public
sector. In the health sector, these frequently take the
form of budget cuts with negative effects on the availability and affordability of health services and of essential drugs such as antibiotics, and the creation and
maintenance of infrastructure. Thus per capita health
spending fell significantly between 2009 and 2011 in
11 OECD countries, notably in Greece and Ireland
(11.1 and 6.6 per cent respectively) (OECD, 2013c).
Table 5.4 provides an overview of some recent announcements of fiscal consolidation policies in the area
of health protection, along with the actual or projected
fiscal savings arising.
These announcements reveal both general budget
cuts for government health ministries and severe cutbacks in public health expenditure on a per capita basis.

Such cuts have resulted in reduced supply of health care
in a range of areas, from preventive care to non-emergency care for undocumented migrants in Spain. Reductions in public expenditure also affected the wages
of the health workforce (table 5.5); caused the postponement of important reforms improving and extending legal health coverage, e.g. the national health
insurance system in Cyprus; imposed volume limits on
some services; and led to reduced benefits and the removal of preventive care. Meanwhile, OOP increased
markedly in several countries, while public health expenditure contracted or remained more or less constant
(table 5.6).
The shift of the burden for paying health care from
the public purse to individuals and households is having
a particularly severe effect on lower income groups,
given the regressive impact of OOP. As a result, gaps in
coverage and access between rich and poor are widening. Thus fiscal consolidation policies combined with
growing poverty due to the recession are likely to increase inequities within countries.
In addition, job and wage cuts for health workers
significantly reduced access to health services. Table 5.5
outlines the most recently announced cuts in wages
of public sector workers, including health workers, in
European countries that were particularly badly hit by
the financial crises: in Greece, cuts have reduced public
wages since 2010 by some 30 percentage points, while
in Portugal and Spain reductions of 5 percentage points
have occurred.
At just the same time as fiscal consolidation measures were resulting in reductions in the numbers and
wages of health workers, an increased demand for
public health services was apparent in countries such
as Greece and Cyprus. Even though public hospital
admissions were rising and private hospital admissions
falling (Kentikelenis et al., 2011), the Government of
Cyprus decided to postpone the implementation of
the planned national health insurance scheme (WHO,
2012), which led to further inequities and gaps in
access.
Overall, the impact of fiscal consolidation measures
taken in response to the crisis has been to stall or even
reverse progress towards universal health coverage by
sharpening inequities in access to health care, increasing the financial burden on private households, reducing benefits and thus increasing exclusion.

accumulation. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

As for their impact on the economy, it can be concluded that, rather than curing the symptoms of debts
and deficits, fiscal consolidation measures in the area of
health protection have acted as barriers to economic recovery and worsened the effects of the economic crisis
by weakening the productivity of the workforce and reducing employment of much-needed health workers. In
addition, these measures have had a negative impact on
the right to work and on adequate standards of living,
particularly those of the most vulnerable segments of
the population that have been hit hardest by budget
cuts and increased OOP.

5.11 Addressing the challenges:
Achieving sustainable progress
in access to health care
The recent economic and financial crisis strained households’ and governments’ budgets in many countries. It
led to preventable negative impacts on health through
the reduced availability and affordability of quality
health care, and contributed to increased inequities in
access to health care. Furthermore, the economic recovery was hampered by the fiscal consolidation measures

taken to address it. There is now an urgent need to act
in pursuit of sustainable progress.
Scaling up global and national health coverage rates
and providing access to necessary health benefits, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, will end
the downward spiral of ill health and poverty and contribute to economic recovery. However, to achieve sustainable progress it will be necessary to rethink policies
and consider lessons learnt.
In recent decades, the importance of health coverage
to the economy has often been insufficiently taken into
account by policy-makers, who accepted the existence
of huge access deficits that in some countries have left
up to 80 per cent of the population – often those most
in need – without any legal health coverage. In addition, the erroneously assumed trade-off between costs
of universal coverage in health and economic growth
led to potential gains in productivity, employment and
development more generally being overlooked. As a
result, ill health was frequently understood as a private
matter, ignoring the complex social and economic relationships that link poverty, employment, gender and
socio-economic stratification in excluding people from
effective access to health care.
A contemporary concept of providing access to
health care through social protection places health
within a framework based on human rights. ILO Recommendation No. 202 connects the right to health
with the underlying social and economic determinants
and addresses these links at the systemic level, both
within and beyond the health sector, rather than pointing to the individual level and advising short-term
­remedies without seeing the big picture.
Such an approach aims at sustainable progress
through investments in social health protection structures and institutions, backed up by political commitment and technical knowledge. It requires an explicit
acknowledgement of the need for both legal health coverage and accessibility of at least essential health care
that is available, of acceptable quality, and affordable
without financial hardship. Such provision contributes
to equity, reducing exclusion as well as poverty. Further, a contemporary concept of universal health coverage involves fair financing based on burden-sharing,
using taxes (e.g. for national health services), contributions/payroll taxes and/or premium-based financing
(for various forms of social, national or private insurances). OOP does not feature as a means of health financing but may be used in a minimal capacity for
other purposes, such as incentives. The obligation to
meet the core content of the right to health through

ILO Recommendation No. 202 offers guidance on
related policies that are necessary to fully realize the
positive impacts and sustainability of investments in
health and achieve universal health coverage (table 5.7).
According to this Recommendation, access to needed
health care should be enshrined in legislation that protects the affordability of services and ensures access to
care in terms of the availability of services and facilities
that are of adequate quality and delivered by skilled
staff. The aim should be universal coverage based on
the provision of, at a minimum, essential health care
benefits. Such benefits are to be defined at national level
with a view to meeting vital medical needs and demand
for maternal and preventive care, and providing financial protection. The progressive development of essential health care towards more comprehensive benefit
packages is recommended.
The availability of quality services necessitates that
a sufficient number of health workers be trained, recruited, provided with decent working conditions and
distributed in an equitable way within countries, particularly in rural and urban slum areas. In this context, it is essential that governments balance supply and
demand within national labour markets through improved working conditions, including wages. Further,
it is important to address wage disparities across regions, and between general practitioners and specialists.

9  Labour Clauses (Public Contracts) Convention, 1949 (No. 94).

Financing

Complementary policies

Improving working conditions and wages for healthcare workers is crucial for overcoming the lack of
labour supply in all branches of the sector. This requires
the right to organize and bargain for all health-care
workers. Collective bargaining is the best way to negotiate workplace arrangements that attract the necessary
number and quality of health-care workers. Further,
public authorities need to be exemplary employers and
procurers. Thus, expenditure of public funds and any
contract for health-care provision must include clauses
ensuring decent wages.9 Key instruments to achieve
the necessary conditions include laws and regulations,
collective agreements and other mechanisms for negotiation between employers’ and workers’ representatives,
and arbitration awards. Finally, as regards migration of
health workers, bilateral and multilateral arrangements
are needed with a view to compensate for training costs
and avoiding brain drain.
Generating sufficient funds for universal health protection involves exploring the pros and cons of all existing financing mechanisms and efficiently coordinating
various approaches in a way that is perceived as fair,
avoids fragmentation and tax evasion, and combats corruption. Most important for allocating sufficient funds
is political will, as shown most recently in Thailand,
where universal health coverage was achieved within a
decade and reform efforts started in conditions of relatively low per capita income and a large informal economy (Evans et al., 2012). Further, fiscal policies should

Contents

5. Towards universal coverage in health

be systematically used with a view to closing funding
gaps and addressing the reciprocal relationship between
ill health and poverty through various social protection measures. In this context, returns on investments
in health in terms of productivity, employment and development should be taken into account when assessing
the cost of extending social health protection.
Many of the problems outlined in this chapter may
be diagnosed as resulting at least in part from inefficient and ineffective governance and administration
of national systems of health protection. This raises
broad issues such as the absence of political and institutional commitment as well as the importance of
regular monitoring, feedback and support through tripartite national and social dialogue. Monitoring advances
in equitable access against thresholds is a prerequisite
of sustainable progress. Thresholds should be set with
a view to measuring both affordability and availability
of quality care and financial protection for all in need,
and should include universal population coverage in
terms of legislation, limitations on OOP to rule out
impoverishment or rise above 40 per cent of household income (net of subsistence), and a threshold of
41.1 health workers, enjoying decent working conditions, per 10,000 population.
Further, social dialogue, fundamentally on a
tripartite basis, is essential in addressing inefficiencies – whether they are of an administrative or managerial nature within a scheme or system, or result from
incoherent policies at the national, regional or community level. The need for social dialogue has been reinforced in Recommendation No. 202, which mandates
“tripartite participation with representative organizations of employers and workers, as well as consultation
with other relevant and representative organizations of
persons concerned” (Para. 3(r)). In facilitating progress
in health protection it is of paramount importance
to establish regular tripartite social dialogue between
relevant stakeholders under the leadership of national

governing bodies, and to ensure proper governance and
administration of health systems and policies.
In addressing equally the needs for essential health
care and income support, the policies suggested in
table 5.7 provide ample scope for tackling the root
causes of inequities in access to health care and contributing to universal coverage of social protection in
health. When implementing coherent policies across
the social, economic and health sectors, governments
should emphasize poverty alleviation and labour market
policies in order to avoid unintended increases in inequality and to realize the economic spillover effects.
These policies have the potential to achieve both
universal health coverage and economic returns – in
all countries, and at all levels of national income. They
entail:
•	 a political vision of universality based on an inclusive framework that is supported by a committed
government, social partners and civil society and incorporates an evidence-based system and/or scheme
design applying technical expertise and global best
practices;
•	 objectives that match expectations of the population
in terms of availability, affordability and quality of
services;
•	 realizing the potential of social protection floor policies, created, implemented and monitored on the
basis of solid assessment and impact analyses, to
create fiscal space and generate domestic funds for
health protection;
•	 institutions characterized by good governance that
have the capacity and means to implement necessary
reforms based on efficient and effective strategies
aimed at coordinating existing schemes and systems,
addressing gaps in the health workforce and striving
to ensure that people receive the care they expect
wherever they live.

KEY MESSAGES
nn The global financial and economic crisis has forcefully underlined the importance of social security as a human right, and as an economic and social
necessity, as set out in the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation
(2012), No. 202.
nn In the first phase of the crisis (2008–09), social protection played a strong role
in the expansionary response. About 50 high- and middle-income countries
announced fiscal stimulus packages totalling US$2.4 trillion, of which approximately a quarter was invested in counter-cyclical social protection measures.
nn In the second phase of the crisis (2010 onwards), many governments embarked
on fiscal consolidation and premature contraction of expenditure, despite an
urgent need of public support among vulnerable populations. In 2014, the
scope of public expenditure adjustment is expected to intensify significantly;
according to IMF projections, 122 countries will be contracting expenditures in
terms of GDP, of which 82 are developing countries. Further, a fifth of countries
are undergoing fiscal consolidation, defined as cutting public expenditures
below pre-crisis levels.
nn Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolidation measures are not limited
to Europe; many developing countries have adopted adjustment measures,
including the elimination or reduction of food and fuel subsidies; cuts or caps
on wages, including for health and social care workers; more narrow targeting
of social protection benefits; and reforms of pension and health care systems.
Many governments are also considering revenue-side measures, for example
increasing consumption taxes such as value added tax (VAT) on basic products
that are consumed by poor households.
nn In developing countries, some of the proceeds of these adjustments, e.g. from
the elimination of subsidies, have been used to design narrowly targeted safety
nets, as a compensatory mechanism to the poorest. However, given the large
number of vulnerable low-income households in developing countries, more
efforts are necessary to meet the social protection needs of the population.
nn Of particular significance are the divergent trends in richer and poorer countries: while many high-income countries are contracting their social security
systems, many developing countries are expanding them.
"

119

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

nn High-income countries have reduced a range of social protection benefits and
limited access to quality public services. Together with persistent unemployment,
lower wages and higher taxes, these measures have contributed to increases in
poverty or social exclusion, now affecting 123 million people in the European
Union, 24 per cent of the population, many of them children, women and persons with disabilities. Future old-age pensioners will receive lower pensions in at
least 14 European countries. Several European courts have found cuts unconstitutional. The cost of adjustment has been passed on to populations, who have
been coping with fewer jobs and lower income for more than five years. Depressed
household income levels are leading to lower domestic consumption and lower
demand, slowing down recovery. The achievements of the European social model,
which dramatically reduced poverty and promoted prosperity and social cohesion
in the period following the Second World War, have been eroded by short-term
adjustment reforms.
nn Most middle-income countries are boldly expanding their social protection systems, thereby contributing to their domestic demand-led growth strategies: this
presents a powerful development lesson. China, for instance, has achieved nearly
universal coverage of pensions and increased wages; Brazil accelerated the expansion of social protection coverage and minimum wages since 2009. Continued
commitment is necessary to address persistent inequalities.

120

nn Some lower-income countries have extended social protection mainly through
narrowly targeted temporary safety nets with very low benefit levels. However, in
many of these countries debates are under way on building social protection floors
as part of comprehensive social protection systems. There are options available
to governments to expand fiscal space for social protection even in the poorest
countries.
nn The case for social protection is compelling in our times. Social protection is both
a human right and sound economic policy. Social protection powerfully contributes
to reducing poverty, exclusion, and inequality – while enhancing political stability
and social cohesion. Social protection also contributes to economic growth by
supporting household income and thus domestic consumption; this is particularly
important during this time of slow recovery and low global demand. Further, social
protection enhances human capital and productivity, so it has become a critical
policy for transformative national development. Social protection and specifically
social protection floors are essential for recovery, inclusive development and social
justice, and must be part of the post-2015 development agenda.

S

ocial protection systems have undergone profound
changes in recent years. While many emerging
economies have taken bold measures to expand social
protection to promote economic and social development, other parts of the world, including many highincome countries, have been grappling with fiscal
consolidation1 and adjusting their social protection systems to make for cost savings. These divergent policy
trends and their implications are the focus of this chapter. In particular, the chapter identifies the rationale

and impact of, respectively, fiscal consolidation measures and expansionary policies on recovery efforts in
high-, middle- and low-income countries. The chapter
concludes by setting out the positive developmental impacts of social protection in the drive to promote sustainable and inclusive growth, to build human capital,
and to achieve political stability, together constituting
a set of powerful reasons why social protection must be
part of the post-2015 development agenda.

6.1 Grappling with recession and slow growth:
Social protection and the global crisis
6.1.1 Social protection in the first phase
of the global crisis: Expansion
and fiscal stimulus (2008–09)
As the crisis bit in 2008–09, the vast majority of governments in countries immediately affected scaled up
public social expenditure in order to sustain growth and
protect their populations from the adverse effects of the
food, fuel and financial shocks. A total of 145 countries
ramped up public expenditure during this first phase of
the crisis. At least 48 countries announced fiscal stimulus packages totalling US$2.4 trillion, of which approximately a quarter was invested in social protection
measures (figure 6.1). An ILO survey of fiscal stimulus
plans in 54 developing and developed countries (ILO,
2009b) indicated that 54  per cent of governments
boosted cash transfers, 44 per cent supported old-age
pensions and 37 per cent increased access to health
benefits. Additionally, 16 per cent of governments introduced food subsidies.
Social protection played a key role in attenuating
the immediate negative effects of the crisis on households in this first phase. One of the key lessons from
these initial crisis responses is that social protection can
function as an automatic stabilizer most effectively if

the relevant schemes and programmes are implemented
before crisis conditions take hold (ILO, 2010c; ILO and
World Bank, 2012; Bonnet, Saget and Weber, 2012;
Behrendt et al., 2011). In the absence of such social protection measures, the effect of the crisis on unemployment, households’ disposable income and poverty rates
in 2009–10 would have been much higher (ILO, 2011a).
6.1.2 Social protection in the second phase
of the global crisis: Fiscal consolidation
(2010 and after)
These Keynesian counter-cyclical measures were shortlived. As the crisis moved into a second phase from 2010
onwards, rising concerns over sovereign debt levels and
fiscal deficits led governments to abandon fiscal stimuli
and introduce fiscal consolidation measures. According
to the IMF’s projections of government expenditure in
the World Economic Outlook database (October 2013),
106 of the 181 countries for which data were available
moved to contract public spending in 2010.
In 2014, the scope of public expenditure contraction is expected to intensify significantly, with impacts
in 122 countries, and then steadily increase to affect
125 countries in 2015. The latest IMF forecast suggests
that governments will continue on this contractionary
trend at least through 2016 (figure 6.2, panel (a)).2 It is

important to note that this trend is observed across
countries with different levels of income. Specifically,
during 2010 public expenditure contraction affected 13
low-income, 28 lower-middle-income, 33 upper-middleincome and 32 high-income countries. In 2014, according to IMF fiscal projections, as many as 82 developing
and 40 high-income countries are expected to contract
public expenditures.3
In terms of real spending growth, a more conservative measure, IMF fiscal data reveal a peak contraction
in 2011, with more than 60 countries contracting, but
thereafter an easing from 2012 onwards (figure 6.2,
panel (b)). Again, the incidence is larger in developing
countries than in high-income economies.
Compared with the pre-crisis period, an alarming
number of countries in 2013–15 appear to be undergoing excessive fiscal contraction, defined as cutting
public expenditures below pre-crisis levels.4 In terms of
GDP, analysis of expenditure projections reveals that in
37 countries (one-fifth of the total), governments may
be cutting their budgets excessively during 2013–15
(figure 6.3, panel (a)). These include countries with significant development challenges, such as Eritrea, Sudan,
Iraq, Guinea-Bissau, Yemen, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Botswana, Cabo Verde,
Turkmenistan, Burundi, Lebanon and the Philippines,
among others. Nearly half (18) of these countries are
expected to reduce spending by more than 3.0 per cent

of GDP, on average, during this latest phase of the crisis
when compared to expenditure levels during the precrisis period. In real terms, 17 governments are forecast
to have fiscal envelopes in 2013–15 that are smaller, on
average, than those of 2005–07 (figure 6.3, panel (b)).
This is a dramatic situation, especially for developing
countries where social spending is already very limited
to start with.
How have governments been adjusting public expenditures since 2010? A review of 314 IMF country
reports in 174 countries published between January
2010 and February 2013 (Ortiz and Cummins, 2013)
indicates that governments are considering a combination of six main policy options (table 6.1), which relate
strongly to the social protection of populations (see also
box 6.1): phasing out or eliminating subsidies; cutting
or capping wage bills; increasing taxes on consumption; undertaking pension reforms aimed at reducing
the costs of pension systems; rationalizing and more
narrowly targeting social assistance and other social
protection benefits; and introducing reforms to healthcare systems aimed at cost containment. These fiscal
consolidation strategies are not limited to Europe, and,
in fact, are prevalent in developing countries. Many
governments are also considering revenue-side measures that can have adverse impacts on vulnerable
populations, mainly the introduction or extension of
consumption taxes such as VAT, on basic products that

4  For the purposes of this report, excessive fiscal contraction is defined as reducing government expenditure below pre-crisis levels (average
spending values during 2005–07). The analysis does not make a judgement about the adequacy or not of pre-crisis spending levels, it merely
uses expenditures in 2005–07 to establish a baseline.

Box 6.1  From fiscal stimulus to fiscal
consolidation – Implications for social protection
In 2008 – 09 there was a global counter-cyclical
policy consensus, whereby countries coordinated
policies to combat the negative social and economic
impacts of the crisis with the aim of maintaining demand and growth. The IMF spelled out the need for
global fiscal stimulus: “In normal times, the Fund
would indeed be recommending to many countries
that they reduce their budget deficit and their public
debt. But these are not normal times … if no fiscal
stimulus is implemented, then demand may continue to fall … what is needed is … a commitment
by governments that they will follow whatever policies it takes to avoid a repeat of a Great Depression
scenario” (Blanchard, 2008).
Early in 2010, IMF advice underwent a major
change (later to be supported by the OECD), and ultimately also by the G20. Two IMF Board papers approved in February 2010 – Exiting from crisis intervention policies and Strategies for fiscal consolidation in
the post-crisis world – called for large-scale fiscal adjustment “when the recovery is securely underway”
and for structural reforms in public finance to be
initiated immediately “even in countries where the
recovery is not yet securely underway” (IMF, 2010a;
IMF, 2010b). Reforms of pension and health entitlements were called for, accompanied by strengthened
“safety nets” for the poorest (IMF, 2010a, pp. 15–
32). On the composition of fiscal adjustment, it was
advised that most of it could come from:
1.	 unwinding the previously adopted fiscal stimulus
packages;
2.	reforming pension and health entitlements to
reduce the long-term financial obligations of the
state by way of avoiding “a rise in spending as a
share of GDP” (IMF, 2010a, p. 16);
3.	containing other spending, by means such as
eliminating subsidies;
4.	 increasing tax revenues.
All these suggested reforms became mainstream
policy advice in a majority of countries around the
world after 2010 and shaped the direction embraced
by the economic adjustment programmes agreed
with countries facing a sovereign debt crisis. The
OECD 2010 Economic Outlook (OECD, 2010d) also
focused on the urgent need for fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms (in, for example, labour and
product markets), pointing out that in both OECD and
non-OECD countries the economic slack was disappearing rapidly. While these documents generally
focused on higher-income countries, they also urged
fiscal adjustment in developing countries, given that
the risk of debt distress was increasing there too.
These documents thus represented the first signs of
a worldwide policy reversal. However, it turned out
that economic slack did not disappear and instead
a slow growth pattern risks becoming entrenched,
partly due to fiscal consolidation itself.

are disproportionately consumed by poor households.
All of the different adjustment approaches pose potentially serious consequences for vulnerable populations,
as summarized below.

Eliminating or reducing subsidies
Overall, 100 governments in 78 developing and
22 high-income countries appear to be reducing or removing subsidies, predominately on fuel, but also on
electricity, food and agriculture. While energy subsidies are being scaled back across all regions, this policy
choice appears to be especially dominant in the Middle
East and North Africa, South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa. The removal of public support for food and agriculture is also most frequently observed in the Middle
East and North Africa, and in sub-Saharan Africa.
These adjustment measures are being implemented at
a time when food and energy prices are hovering near
record highs; if basic subsidies are withdrawn without
compensation being provided through adequate social
protection mechanisms, food and energy may become
unaffordable for many households, in particular, but
not only, the poorest ones. The lack of proper compensation has led to a significant number of public demonstrations, reported in 60 countries (Ortiz et al., 2013;
Zaid et al., 2014).

Wage bill cuts/caps
As recurrent expenditures such as the salaries of civil
servants (particularly of social sector workers) tend to

be the largest component of national budgets, an estimated 98 governments in 75 developing and 23 highincome countries have considered reducing their public
wage bills, often as a part of civil service reforms. This
policy stance may translate into salaries being reduced
or eroded in real value, payments being made in arrears,
hiring freezes and/or employment retrenchment, all of
which have adverse impacts on the delivery of public
services to the population. Health authorities have
warned of the health hazards caused by such fiscal consolidation in Europe and other regions.

Increasing consumption taxes
on goods and services
Some 94 governments in 63 developing and 31 highincome countries have been considering options to
boost revenue by raising rates of VAT or sales tax, or
removing exemptions. The consequent increases in the
costs of basic goods and services are usually regressive,
as they tend to affect more significantly the costs of
living of lower-income households, including those already in poverty, unless compensatory measures are in
place, for example through the provision of cash and
near-cash (e.g. food stamps) benefits, or the distribution of basic goods and services at subsidized prices to
lower income groups. Some other countries are considering alternative tax approaches, involving for example
the expansion of usually more progressive taxes, such
as those on income, inheritance, property and corporations, including taxes on the financial sector.

6. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

Reforming pension and health systems
Approximately 86 governments in 47 developing and
39 high-income countries have been considering a variety of changes to their contributory pension systems,
by means such as making eligibility conditions stricter
or raising the statutory pensionable age, so that people
have to work longer to receive a full benefit, lowering
benefit replacement rates, or eliminating minimum
pension guarantees for less fortunate workers. Another 37 countries are also discussing reforming their
health-care systems with a focus on cost containment,
generally by increasing fees and co-payments made
by patients along with cost-saving measures in public
health centres. These adjustment measures have immediate negative effects on the poor, increase poverty risks
for others, and may lead to the effective exclusion of
many from the receipt of benefits or critical assistance
at a time when their incomes are decreasing and their
social needs are greatest.

Rationalizing and more narrowly targeting social
assistance and other social protection benefits
Overall, 80 governments in 55 developing and 25 highincome countries have been considering rationalizing
their social spending, often by revising eligibility criteria and targeting benefits more narrowly on the very
poorest, which implies a de facto reduction of social
protection coverage and a more limited role for social
protection systems in preventing poverty. A  more
narrow targeting on the poorest has been discussed
by governments in 25 high-income and 55 developing
countries, including low-income countries such as the
Gambia, Haiti, Mali, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Senegal, Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo and Zambia, where on
average about half of the population is below the national poverty line. In such places, the rationale for targeting assistance on the poorest of the poor is weak. This
policy approach runs a high risk of excluding large segments of vulnerable populations at a time of economic
crisis and hardship. Rather than targeting and scaling
down social protection programmes to achieve cost savings over the short term, there is a strong case for scaling them up in times of crisis and building rights-based
social protection floors.

Contrary to public perception, fiscal consolidation measures are not limited to Europe; in fact, most
of the adjustment measures summarized here feature
most prominently in developing countries, particularly subsidy reduction, wage bill cuts/caps, and more
and more “rationalization” of existing social protection programmes. The main risk of these expenditurecontracting measures is that, when taken without due
recognition of their negative consequences, they result
in often large vulnerable groups being excluded from
receiving benefits or critical assistance.
Ill-designed fiscal consolidation measures threaten
not only the human right to social security, but also the
rights to food, health, education, and other essential
goods and services (Sepúlveda, 2012; UN, 2012b). In
many contexts, fiscal consolidation policies are driven
by a cost-saving logic, and their negative social impacts
on women, children, older persons, the unemployed,
immigrants or persons with disabilities, are viewed as
unavoidable collateral damage in the quest for fiscal balances and debt service (CESR, 2012). The UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights has warned that “austerity measures endanger social protection schemes, including pensions, thereby dramatically affecting the
enjoyment of the rights to social security and to an adequate standard of living” (OHCHR, 2013, para. 36),
particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups,
pointing to States’ positive obligation to ensure adequate
financial regulation, as necessary to safeguard human
rights, as well as the obligation to ensure the satisfaction,
at the very least, of minimum essential levels of all economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to
social security (OHCHR, 2013, esp. paras 36–71).
6.1.3 Divergent trends across countries
Generally, the latest available complete data (2011)
show a worldwide decline in social protection expenditure in terms of GDP, particularly for middle-income
and high-income countries (figure 6.4).5 Only lowincome countries have increased public social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP. The level of
social expenditure has not risen sufficiently to keep up
with the increases in unemployment and poverty.
The four panels of figure 6.4 show trends in per
capita real government social protection expenditure in

their more recent effects on inequalities and poverty, are limited.

the two phases of the crisis. It is clear that, despite the
significant contraction in 2011, a large number of countries (mostly in the developing world) were at that point
still expanding social security. It must be noted that
in many of these developing countries such expansion
is being partly financed using the cost savings resulting from fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures
such as reducing or eliminating subsidies (including
food and fuel subsidies). The net social outcome effects
remain to be studied and will inevitably vary from
country to country.

While a significant number of governments have
adjusted their social protection systems since 2010,
many developing countries have taken bold measures to
extend social protection coverage and enhance at least
the social assistance provided to the poorest segments
of their populations (see figures 6.5 and 6.6). The strong
push for the expansion of social protection started well
before the onset of the global crisis, but has accelerated
since 2009, sometimes as part of short-term fiscal stimulus measures, often as part of longer-term structural
policies aiming at promoting human and economic development, as well as political stability.

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

6.2 High-income countries: Fiscal
consolidation and its effects
The majority of high-income countries (HICs)6 have
been engaged in long-term reforms of social protection pension systems since long before the crisis, under
pressure from demographic change and the search for
long-term sustainability. The recent fiscal consolidation
policies have accelerated such changes, however, affecting all areas of social protection.
6.2.1 Overview: Prioritizing financial sector
recovery over social protection

128

The significant increases in social protection spending in
the early phase of the crisis were broadly aimed at countervailing the exceptional severity of the economic downturn. There were, however, significant differences across
countries: in late 2008 and 2009, while among European
HICs such increases amounted to around 7 per cent in
real terms, they exceeded 10 per cent in the entire OECD
and reached 15 per cent in the United States, with their
effect continuing through 2010 (OECD, 2012b). These
increases crucially contributed to minimizing the social
costs and limiting the economic impact of the crisis by
avoiding a collapse of consumption and maintaining economic activity (see section 6.2.2 below).
The second phase of the crisis, beginning in 2010,
saw a total policy reversal: annual spending growth
slowed significantly, followed by a contraction in social
expenditure in 2011 for many HICs. This reflected not
a reduction in social protection needs, but rather a 180degree shift in governments’ public expenditure policy
from 2010 onwards. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe
turned public attention to government spending, as if
it were this that had caused the crisis. However, government debt and deficits were symptoms of the crisis,
not its cause. Rising debts and deficits at this point resulted from bank bailouts to rescue the financial sector
from bankruptcy, stimulus packages, and lower government revenues due to the slowdown in economic

activity (figure 6.7). Yet fiscal consolidation focused on
deep cutbacks to public policies and shrinking the State
as the main way to fix the deficit, calm the markets and
revitalize the economy; following this logic, the Euro­
pean social model was depicted as unaffordable and
burdensome, which ultimately reduced competitiveness
and discouraged growth.
When government policies shifted highest priority
to servicing debt and achieving fiscal balances in 2010,
employment and social protection became secondary
priorities. Decisions were taken to reduce public expenditures in most HICs, despite rising unemployment and poverty (see table 6.1 above). Public social
expenditure in HICs has not kept pace with populations’ needs for income security and access to health
and other social services.
Overall, unemployment rose by more than 45 per
cent, with more than 44 million unemployed in OECD
HICs in 2013 compared to 2008, while expenditure
on unemployment benefits and tax-funded social assistance was initially increased but later reduced, with
around half of those unemployed not receiving unemployment benefits (ILO, 2014a; Annex IV, table B.3
in this report). At the time of writing this report, there
are large groups of people, many of them formerly in the
middle class, living in conditions of poverty or near-poverty in HICs; this situation is most evident in the crisisaffected countries of Europe, where in 2012 there were
9.5 million more poor people than in 2008, and child
poverty was reported to be increasing at an alarming
rate7 (figure 6.8). Rising unemployment and increased
poverty on such a scale in so many European countries
should have prompted measures to further strengthen
social protection expenditure rather than curtailments
informed by fiscal consolidation objectives.
Reductions in social protection were most severe
in those HICs with the highest budget deficits, which
were also those with the most limited social assistance
programmes in place (Greece, Portugal and Ireland)
(Vaughan-Whitehead, 2014).8 According to a recent
OECD survey across more than 30 OECD countries,
around half have been considering fiscal consolidation

6  This section focuses mostly on HICs which are members of the OECD. The situation of other HICs is not discussed here as it mostly
relates to countries where social protection developments resemble those of middle-income countries: for example, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where aggregate social protection expenditure is less than 5 per cent of GDP (with the exception of
Kuwait, where it amounts to 12 per cent of GDP), in comparison to an average of 22 per cent of GDP in OECD countries.
7  Eurostat data for 2012, except Ireland (2011); based on fixed poverty line as of 2008.
8  Greece reduced public spending by more than €30 billion or the equivalent of 10 per cent of GDP between 2009 and 2011, and an
additional 8 per cent is expected to be saved by 2015 (Hermann, 2013; OECD, 2012c).The Irish austerity programme is also intended to
save approximately 18 per cent of GDP by 2015, while Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Hungary aim at 7–8 per cent of savings at
least (Vaughan-Whitehead, 2014).

plans requiring adjustments of more than 5 per cent of
GDP from 2009 to 2015, with a high predominance of
direct spending cuts as opposed to revenue-side measures
(figure 6.9). The survey indicates that the current fiscal
consolidation plans are leading to a decline in social transfers in cyclically adjusted terms in about half of OECD
countries, while adjusted household taxes are expected
at the same time to increase in most OECD countries.9

Social protection has frequently been targeted for
expenditure reductions or freezes, in particular in the
areas of unemployment benefits, health care, pensions
and social assistance (see table 6.2). On the revenue side,
measures have often aimed at increasing indirect taxes,
such as VAT, which is reported to have increased on
average by 1.8 percentage points in European Union
member countries.10 Such increases in indirect taxes

reported plans to improve their public budgets primarily via spending restraints (Rawdanowicz, Wurzel and Christensen, 2013).
10  According to Eurostat, the average VAT rate in the EU was 19.4 per cent in 2008; by 2012, it had increased to 21.0 per cent.

Box 6.2  Using sovereign pension reserve funds to fund bailouts
Sovereign pension reserve funds, normally established to support governments in funding future pension
liabilities by complementing the accumulated funds from employers’ and workers’ contributions, have been
tapped to a substantial extent during the course of the global crisis to help ease the strain on national public
finances. In some cases they have been used them to finance interventions directly; in others, to support
specific economic sectors facing difficulties or to guarantee loans.
For example, the Irish National Pension Reserve Fund was used to recapitalize the Irish banking system as
one of the solicited national contributions under the economic adjustment programme for Ireland. Another
example is the Australian Future Fund, which received its last financial allocation from the government in
2008, as a result of which its asset level is now considered to fall below its target level as determined by Australia’s Government Actuary. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund, meanwhile, has increased its exposure
to New Zealand’s domestic economy in response to the government’s advice to consider attractive investment opportunities in New Zealand. Here too, the government reduced the transfer of funds from the government budget to the Fund in 2009/10 and suspended it in 2010/11; it is scheduled to resume in 2020/21.

disproportionately affect low income groups (Thomas
and Picos-Sánchez, 2012).
In addition to these measures, some governments
have had to look at available sources of funding to finance bailouts of financial institutions in trouble. The
use of national pension funds, either through explicit
loans and investment decisions or through non-explicit loan guarantees (see box 6.2), is cause for concern,
as such funds are subject to rigorous performance

objectives and targets as well as strict governance rules
which now appear to be being sidestepped. Such pension assets usually represent the accumulated contributions of workers and employers towards guaranteeing
their social security in old age, a demand ever more
pressing as these societies age.
Overall, the deployment of vast public resources

plans, caused sovereign debt to increase, forced taxpayers to absorb the losses and, ultimately, hindered economic growth (figure 6.10). Many governments have
curtailed government consumption and investment
and also reduced social benefits, thus creating a vicious
circle: reductions in infrastructure investment and
public sector wages, as well as cuts in social security,
further depressed aggregate demand in the economy,
in consequence reducing the demand for labour, and
thus in turn increasing unemployment, reducing revenues from income taxation and narrowing the available fiscal envelope, thereby adding pressure to further
reduce social transfers. The cost of adjustment has been
passed on to populations, who have now been attempting to cope with fewer jobs, lower income and reduced
access to public goods and services for more than five
years.

6.2.2 First phase of the crisis: Scaling up social
protection to sustain households’ disposable
income and domestic demand (2008–09)
The automatic provision of unemployment insurance
benefits in the early phase of the crisis demonstrated
the counter-cyclical role of such schemes, where funded
from accumulated contributions with a view to meeting
increased benefit expenditures during economic downturns. In a number of countries, these schemes were
scaled up to facilitate access to benefits in the face of
massive unemployment. For example, the United States
extended the maximum duration for paying benefits
as job opportunities were too few to accommodate the
increased numbers of unemployed. Other countries,
such as Germany, adjusted their legal frameworks to
allow companies in certain sectors to introduce a temporary reduction in working time, compensated for by
social protection benefits, in order to avoid job cuts.

Other examples of good practice include special stimulus packages incorporating urgently needed social assistance benefits for the growing number of poor. These
and other such short-term adjustments limited the fall
in citizens’ purchasing power and thus also the decline
in global aggregate demand.
Data from the United States, Japan, France and
Germany from 2009 to early 2010 provide evidence of
the counter-cyclical automatic economic and social stabilizer function of social protection expenditure, especially of the role played by special fiscal stimuli to scale
up short-term benefits for the unemployed and the poor
in reversing the downward trend of private consumption expenditure (figure 6.11).11
Further evidence of the counter-cyclical effect of
social protection is provided by analysis of different
components of growth in private disposable income
over time. Before the crisis, labour income, net social
benefits, taxes and property income varied across economic cycles such that gross disposable real income increased by around 4 per cent annually in the European
Area up to 2008 (figure 6.12). Then, in 2009 and early
2010, populations in a majority of countries experienced

significant declines in their incomes from earnings and
other sources of market income, due to increased unemployment, reductions in working time and earnings,
and declining profits and other capital incomes.
On average, incomes from earnings and capital
(market incomes) dwindled by 1.9 per cent per year in
real terms across the OECD over this period; however,
in some countries, such as Greece, Iceland and New
Zealand, market incomes dropped by more than 7 per
cent per year (figure 6.13). Increased social transfers
and other elements of the special fiscal stimuli played a
particularly strong role in cushioning the effects of a reduction of market incomes in countries such as Estonia,
Ireland, New Zealand and Spain. In other countries,
where regular and adequate social protection benefits
were not available, no such cushioning effect against
the drastic falls in households’ disposable income could
be observed. From 2010 up to early 2012, the earnings
component added on average 2 percentage points to
growth of disposable incomes, while changes in reduced
social benefits clearly worked in the opposite direction.
However, the evidence of the counter-cyclical automatic economic and social stabilizer function of

11  In Germany, where 26 per cent of GDP was spent on public social protection in 2012, four stimulus packages were introduced from
2008, with the main aim of preserving jobs. Their cost as of 2011 amounted to about 4 per cent of 2008 GDP (compared to 19.8 per cent
spent on the rescue of the financial sector). In France, where 32 per cent of GDP in 2012 was spent on social protection, extraordinary fiscal
rescue efforts were more modest, representing (as of 2011) 1.6 per cent of 2008 GDP (compared to 19.0 per cent spent on the rescue of the
financial sector). In the United States, where 20 per cent of GDP in 2012 was spent on social protection, there was one main extraordinary
stimulus package in 2008 and some lesser ones afterwards. As of 2011, their cost amounted to about 5.6 per cent of the 2008 GDP
(compared to 5.1 per cent spent on the rescue of the financial sector).

social protection expenditure observed in 2009 and
early 2010 was not enough to contain the pressure from
financial markets, ratings agencies and orthodox approaches to adopt adjustment measures in social protection programmes from 2010. Instead of joining with
social partners in looking for alternative responses to
the crisis that could have enabled them to accommodate structural reform without undermining social
rights or exacerbating the hardship experienced by enterprises, the governments of most HICs adopted fiscal
consolidation policies, including reductions in benefit
entitlements and durations. Negative outcomes during
this deep and protracted economic downturn are seen
not only in increased poverty but also in the gradual
economic effects of reduced aggregate private consumption (see section 6.2.3).
Despite the cushioning and consumption-stabilizing effects of taxes and transfers, the crisis effectively
depressed disposable incomes in many OECD countries, with in many cases negative knock-on effects on
private consumption and aggregate demand. Overall,
between 2007 and 2010 private households suffered an
annual decline in their disposable incomes of as much
as 8.4 per cent in Iceland and between 2 and 4 per cent
in Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, New
Zealand and Spain (figure 6.13). This effect was further
sharpened by the internal devaluations pursued in some
countries of the eurozone.

6.2.3 Second phase of the global crisis:
Fiscal consolidation, 2010 onwards
The turn towards fiscal consolidation measures in the
second phase of the crisis, from 2010 onwards, reversed
the expansionary stance typical of responses to the first
phase and included various measures to reduce benefits. This coincided with the policy reversal adopted by
the IMF Board and endorsed by the OECD and the
G20 (box 6.1). More recently, IMF Chief Economist
Olivier Blanchard has admitted serious underestimation of fiscal multipliers with respect to the depth of
the economic contraction in the design of fiscal consolidation policies (Blanchard and Leigh, 2013); also,
IMF research has acknowledged that fiscal consolidation has adverse effects on both short- and long-term
unemployment, private demand and GDP growth,
with wage earners hurt disproportionately more than
profit- and rent-earners (Guajardo, Leigh and Pescatori,
2011; Ball, Leigh and Loungani, 2011), and that policies that sustain aggregate demand are still critically
important (Blanchard, Jaumotte and Loungani, 2013).
Nevertheless, at the time fiscal consolidation policies
were adopted across HICs, with spending cuts targeted
in particular on short-term benefits, such as unemployment benefits, family benefits and family support programmes, thus making it more difficult for households
to maintain a life in dignity with at least a minimum

6. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

income security, especially for many families with
children. Following recent reforms, some European
countries may no longer be compliant with the requirements of the ILO’s Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), which most of them
have ratified. Table 6.2 provides an overview of some
of the main measures adopted during the global crisis.

Unemployment benefits
Access to unemployment benefits, and the levels and
maximum duration of payments, were reduced starting
in 2010 (see also Chapter 3, section 3.2). Increases in
poverty have been attributed in part to such reductions
in protection: one recent study, for example, argues that
increases in poverty in the United States stem directly
from cuts to unemployment benefits (CBPP, 2014).
In countries with advance-funding approaches, unemployment benefits from 2008 to early 2010 were financed from current contributions and reserve funds
accumulated under unemployment insurance (UI)
schemes. However, as high unemployment rates persisted beyond 2010, UI reserve funds started to run out.
Increases to UI contribution rates were then considered,
although there was reluctance from employers, who
argued on the contrary for pro-cyclical support in the
form of lower social security contributions. This highlights the importance of promoting counter-cyclical UI
funding in countries without advance-funding policies
to ensure the availability of reasonable UI funds during
future economic downturns. The advance funding of
unemployment benefits in reasonable proportions and
within a well-governed framework could help to ease
the pressure on public budgets during downturns, when
needs are high and revenues are falling, and when the
business sector is less receptive to possible contribution
increases.

Health
Most governments have initiated reforms in health
protection systems, such as rationalizing the costs
of public health facilities, introducing patient copayments and cutting wage bills for medical staff.

Increased out-of-pocket expenditures for health add
further pressure on governments to increase pensions
and other social protection benefits to cover the additional cost for households of seeking necessary health
care. Meanwhile, a lower quality of health service
provision leads to worse health outcomes (e.g. Karanikolos et al., 2013; Mladovsky et al., 2012). Weakened mental health, increased substance abuse and
higher suicide rates have all been linked with fiscal
consolidation measures (WHO, 2011a; Stuckler and
Basu, 2013). The European Centre for Disease Control warned that serious health hazards are emerging
because of the fiscal consolidation measures introduced
since 2008.12 More specifically, in Greece, Spain and
Portugal citizens’ access to public health care services
has been seriously constrained, to the extent that there
are reported increases in mortality and morbidity. The
Lancet speaks of “a Greek public health tragedy” in
which citizens are subject to one of the most radical
programmes of welfare state retrenchment in recent
times (Kentikelinis et al., 2014).

Social benefits
The vast array of tax-financed allowances such as child
allowances, disability benefits and housing support
have been rationalized during the crisis in the search
for cost savings. The negative effects of fiscal consolidation on poverty have been most noticeable in countries
where the basic system of social assistance is weak or
has been recently weakened, as in some of the crisis-hit
Baltic States and the European countries under ratified
economic adjustment programmes. The Government
in Greece, for instance, is planning drastic structural
changes to replace a large number of existing social
benefits, such as disability and family benefits, as well
as the minimum pension provided under social insurance schemes, with a safety net for the poorest, a single
targeted guaranteed minimum income scheme providing a relatively low benefit. Ireland is also replacing a
universal child benefit by a means-tested allowance to
low-income families. The introduction of means testing
for previously universal benefits, and the more narrow
targeting of benefits on people living in poverty, erodes
the principles of universal protection which used to be

12  In January 2013, doctors from Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Greece sent an open letter to European political leaders and health
authorities in which they deplored the effects that financial and economic decisions adopted as a response to the economic crisis were having
on the health of the populations of their countries and called for immediate action to reverse this situation: http://www.epha.org/spip.

Pensions

136

Common pension reforms include raising the retirement age, reducing benefits, increasing contribution
rates and reducing pension tax exemptions, as well as
the structural reforms introduced in some countries.
Most countries were introducing changes to their pension systems prior to the crisis, in view of the demographic ageing of populations, but fiscal consolidation
precipitated drastic cost-saving measures adopted without adequate consideration of their social impacts.
Some of these reforms have been contested in national
constitutional courts. A good measure by which to
grasp the effect of reforms is the gross theoretical replacement rate for public (statutory) pensions. Simulations show future pensioners receiving lower pensions
in at least 14 European countries, with a projected decline by more than 10 percentage points in eight countries (figure 6.14).13
Most structural pension reforms in HICs that have
introduced the principle of individual savings have removed the de facto minimum pension guarantees that
used to be explicitly provided under traditional “defined benefit” pension systems (some of which are still
in existence). In addition, numerous reforms have further eroded the purchasing power of pensions through
indexation measures limiting their adjustment to a level
below changes in prices and wages: Spain, for instance,
stopped indexing pensions to price inflation in 2013.14
These changes result in more older persons not having
sufficient income security: pensioners become poorer
and poorer as they grow older and the real value of their
pension dwindles in the absence of adequate indexation
mechanisms. In Sweden and Poland, for instance, poverty rates for older persons have nearly doubled, from
10 to 18 per cent and from 7 to 14 per cent respectively

between 2005 and 2012 (see Chapter 4). There is a need
to revisit pension provisions to ensure that explicit provision is made for minimum benefit guarantees through
contributory pension systems or via coordinated policies with non-contributory social assistance benefits.
Overall, the ILO expects that more and more
workers will have to resort to tax-financed social assistance or guaranteed minimum income schemes
in their old age as a result of the pension reforms of
the past decade or so. Some national pension systems
will no longer meet the adequacy requirements they
are required to fulfil in countries that have ratified the
European Code of Social Security and the ILO’s Convention No. 102 – which is the case for a majority of
European countries.

Erosion of the European social model
In 2012, 123 million people in the then 27 Member
States of the European Union, representing 24 per cent
of the population, were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, compared to 116 million in 2008, and as many as

entitlements under their public systems (EU Social Protection Committee, 2009; European Commission, 2012c).

800,000 more children than in 2008 were living in poverty.15 These figures raised alarm across Europe. Some
estimates foresee an additional 15–25 million people
facing the prospect of living in poverty by 2025 if fiscal
consolidation continues (Oxfam, 2013). Higher poverty
and inequality are the results not only of the severity
of the global recession, but also of specific policy decisions curtailing social transfers and limiting access to
quality public services. The achievements of the European social model,16 which dramatically reduced poverty
and promoted prosperity in the period following the
Second World War, have been eroded during and since
the crisis by a series of adjustment reforms that have led
to a resurgence of poverty in Europe and a loss of prosperity for the middle classes. The long-accepted concept
of universal access to decent living conditions for all citizens has been threatened by a widening gulf between
more narrowly targeted programmes for those at the
lower levels of the income distribution and a stronger
emphasis on individual savings for the middle and upper
income groups. This fragmentation of social security systems limits the potential for a collective pooling of risk,
erodes social solidarity, limits the responsibility of the
State to the care of only the extremely poor, and changes
the terms of the social contract that has been at the very
basis of the European social model. The weakening of
collective bargaining and social dialogue, along with the
deregulation and “flexibilization” of labour markets, has
further compounded this erosion (ILO, 2013b; IILS,
2012; Vaughan-Whitehead, 2013).
Furthermore, while cost savings from fiscal consolidation measures may have assisted in servicing debt,
they have not supported economic growth. In Ireland,
Greece, Portugal and Cyprus, where some of the boldest structural reforms have taken place as part of the
terms agreed under the different economic adjustment
programmes adopted by these countries since 2008,
disposable household incomes have declined in consequence, as a result of high unemployment, lower wages
and social protection expenditure cuts, and this in
turn has led to lower consumption (figure 6.15). For
example, in Greece the reform of the social protection system limits the responsibility of the State to a

guaranteed minimum income benefit targeted on the
poor, which is provisionally set at a low level equivalent to 75 per cent of the current average minimum
pension guarantee. The reform foresees that supplementary pensions will likely become the responsibility of individuals and employers (through a system of
individual accounts); this replaces a system, albeit a
very fragmented one, of dubious sustainability, under
which in the past nearly every person could count on
having at least a minimum old-age pension. As salaries
decreased by nearly 35 per cent and unemployment
increased to 28 per cent between 2008 and the end of
2013, the revenues from contributions to the social security system have dwindled. Continuing to pay social
security benefits would have required deficit financing,
but this was not prioritized. Instead, curtailments informed by fiscal consolidation objectives have reduced
social protection expenditure by more than 12 per cent
in real terms since 2008, and private consumption followed the same downward path (figure 6.15, panel (b)).
Inevitably, poverty in Greece rose to a historically high
level, exceeding 35 per cent of the population in 2013,
inflicting intense human suffering as many families
found themselves unable to access any longer the basic
necessities for a life in dignity. Trade union activists speak of “a programmed impoverishment of the
population”.17
Other countries under severe pressure from financial markets, such as Italy and Spain, also introduced reforms that were more far-reaching than in
countries where the debt crisis was less acute, such
as France or Belgium, or marginal, as in Germany.
While some reforms were aimed at making necessary
improvements in administrative efficiency, others represented a shift away from an approach focusing on
the prevention of poverty and of income insecurity for
the entire population towards an approach limited to
poverty alleviation (“safety nets”). Such reforms have
disproportionately emphasized the fiscal objective of
balan­cing public budgets without due consideration
to the objective of adequate benefits to all people, as
promulgated in various international instruments 
– including, among others, ILO Convention No. 102,

15  According to Eurostat, “at risk of poverty or social exclusion” means that they were at risk of poverty (set at 60 per cent of the national
median equivalized disposable income, after social transfers), severely materially deprived and/or living in households with very low work
intensity (Eurostat, 2013).
16  Recent ILO research identifies the following key features of the European social model: (1) increased minimum rights on working
conditions, (2) universal and sustainable social protection systems, (3) inclusive labour markets, (4) strong and well-functioning social
dialogue, (5) public services and services of general interest, and (6) social inclusion and social cohesion (Vaughan-Whitehead, 2013).

the Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), and the Social Protection
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202). Such disequilibrium constitutes a significant danger for social
cohesion and social justice, and contributes to the erosion of the E
­ uropean social model.
In some European countries, courts have reviewed
the constitutional validity of fiscal consolidation measures. In 2013, the Portuguese constitutional court
ruled that four fiscal consolidation measures in the
budget, mainly affecting civil servants and pensioners, were unlawful and in breach of the country’s constitution. In Latvia, the 2010 budget proposed new
spending cuts and tax increases, including a 10 per cent
cut in pensions and a 70 per cent decrease for working pensioners; the constitutional court ruled that the

pension cuts were unconstitutional on the grounds
that they violated the right to social security, and the
cuts had to be reversed. In Romania, 15 per cent pension cuts proposed in May 2010 were also declared unconstitutional; although pensions partly funded by
worker contributions are constitutionally protected,
the Government had circumvented this protection on
the grounds of a separate constitutional article allowing the temporary limitation of certain rights in order
to defend national security (UNDP and RCPAR,
2011; OHCHR, 2013). More recently, the European
Parliament has launched an inquiry into the democratic legitimacy of adjustment reforms and their social
impacts in Ireland, Cyprus, Spain, Slovenia, Greece,
Portugal and Italy (European Parliament, 2014a; European Parliament, 2014b).

6. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

6.2.4 Adequate transfers, taxes and social
dialogue: Key elements of a socially
responsive recovery
Social protection plays a role in preventing as well as reducing poverty in all societies, although the potential of
different social protection systems to prevent and reduce
poverty varies. For example, without social protection
transfers and tax measures, 32.2 per cent of the people
of Finland would have found themselves in poverty in
2010, as opposed to the 7.3 per cent of the population
who actually were in poverty that year. Figure 6.16 sets
out the effective poverty prevention and reduction capacity of national transfers and tax systems in OECD
countries. It shows quite significant differences between
countries, even for those at a similar level of economic
development and potential fiscal resources, illustrating
the point that it is the political will of each society that
sets the framework for its social protection system.
Social protection supports growth and structural
change in the labour market. It also supports household
income, essential to sustain consumption and domestic
demand. Adequate levels of social protection are an important element of an inclusive growth strategy, as outlined in the various sections of this report.
Integrating social protection, employment and taxation policies is key to a socially responsive recovery.
The increase in poverty and inequalities reflects to a
large extent not just the recent crisis, but a longer-term
trend weakening the State’s developmental role and redistributive capacity (e.g. OECD, 2008; OECD, 2011a;
UNRISD, 2010). Global imbalances may be further
exacerbated as households increase their precautionary savings because they have lost trust in the capacity
and/or willingness of the public system to provide for
their long-term income security. This situation calls
for effective coordination of social protection, employment and fiscal policies to better address emerging circumstances in the labour market and to avert lasting
damage to their knock-on effects on current and future
levels of social protection for all, including not only the
poorer segments of society but also the middle class.
Countries are encouraged to make better use of their
social protection systems in order to avoid a rupture in
solidarity across generations and income groups, and to
achieve social peace.
National dialogue and consultations on alternative
policy options can achieve an optimal balance between
adequacy and sustainability. ILO country surveys in
Europe have indicated that most reforms adopted
during the crisis have been introduced without due

regard to consultations with social partners and key
stakeholders in civil society (e.g. Guardiancich, 2012).
As a result, those reforms tend to be unbalanced, overemphasizing the cost-effectiveness dimension with a
view to restoring public finances, while overlooking
the social outcomes in terms of poverty and inequality.
National dialogue is essential to secure adequate social
protection measures, particularly with regard to protecting children and older persons from poverty and
vulnerability, and to ensure that necessary adjustments
are based on a fair and viable balance between adequacy
and sustainability, as part of the core social contract on
which modern societies are based.
The Social Protection Committee of the European
Commission stressed in late 2013 that lessons must be
learnt from recent reform experiences, that policy corrections must be considered on the basis of robust social
impact assessments of both short- and long-term effects

Box 6.3  Iceland: A socially responsive recovery from the crisis
Iceland repudiated private debt to foreign banks and did not bail out its financial sector, pushing losses on
to bondholders instead of taxpayers. This was not a sovereign debt issue; according to the IMF, this debt
was a result of privatization and deregulation of the banking sector, facilitated by easy access to foreign
funding; the growing imbalances were not detected by Iceland’s financial sector supervision. Two national
referendums, held in 2010 and 2011, allowed citizens to vote on whether and how the country should repay
a nationalized private debt; Icelandic voters delivered a resounding “no” to the orthodox policies that would
have accompanied such a debt repayment plan. Despite the pressures and threats elicited by Iceland’s
heterodox policies – debt repudiation, capital controls and currency depreciation – the country is recovering well from the crisis (Krugman, 2012). It has regained access to international capital markets while
preserving the welfare of its citizens, with support from the IMF. In 2012, Iceland’s credit rating was much
higher than Greece’s. As Iceland’s IMF Article IV Consultation stated:
A key post crisis objective of the Icelandic authorities was to preserve the social welfare system in the
face of the fiscal consolidation needed. Wage increases, agreed among the social partners in May 2011, led
to a rise in nominal wages of 6 per cent and the unemployment rate fell to about 7 per cent in 2012. …
… In designing fiscal adjustment, the authorities introduced a more progressive income tax and created
fiscal space to preserve social benefits. Consequently, when expenditure compression began in 2010,
social protection spending continued to rise as a per cent of GDP, and the number of households receiving
income support from the public sector increased. These policies led to a sharp reduction in inequality.
Iceland’s Gini coefficient – which had risen during the boom – fell in 2010 to levels consistent with its
Nordic peers (IMF, 2012, pp. 5–6).

140
and, above all, that such analysis should be available
before policies are adopted.18 The ILO encourages all
countries to re-establish national policy dialogue with
the social partners and all other parts of civil society to
explore the optimal policy options that effectively address poverty and inequalities.
There are examples of good approaches. The Nordic
social model is not only resilient but has been actively
used in crises. Finland, for example, ring-fenced its
health and social protection system during the major
economic crisis it faced in the 1990s after the downfall of the former Soviet Union, at a time when the
Nordic social model was heavily criticized for impeding
growth. More recently, Nordic countries have reformed
while preserving the fundamental values of their social
model, and are now well placed to face the aftermath
of the global crisis, both economically and socially (see
box 6.3). Other good examples include measures taken
during the early phase of the crisis to scale up targeted
assistance: in the United States, for example, the food
subsidies for the poor which cut the number of households living in extreme poverty by half, and the Affordable Health Care Act of 2013 which introduced health
coverage for all citizens (CBPP, 2014).
Other significant examples include social protection
measures that were already in place before the crisis and

could be easily scaled up when conditions dramatically
worsened, such as the unemployment insurance scheme
in Germany, which could provide adapted benefits to
help limit lay-offs, or the French reforms to provide
firms with incentives for retaining older workers while
also hiring younger workers.

6.3 Middle-income countries: Inclusive
growth through social protection
6.3.1 Significant extension
of social protection coverage
In many middle-income countries, the dominant trend
of recent years, starting well before the global crisis of
2008, has been that of an expansion of social protection
coverage, yet with wide cross-national variation. Many
social protection policy reforms explicitly acknowledged
the importance of investments in health, education and
social protection, in order to foster inclusive growth
and poverty reduction in the short term, and to build
human capital and human capacities in the longer term.
In many ways, these policies mark a clear break with
some of the policies of the 1980s and 1990s, which emphasized cutbacks to the public sector, the introduction

18  The EU Social Protection Committee concluded in September 2013 that “social impact assessments must become part of the Economic
Adjustment Programmes in order to choose the most appropriate path of reforms and adjust the resulting distribution impact across income
and age groups” (EU Social Protection Committee, 2013, p. 26).

of user fees for health, education and other public services, and the privatization of pensions. The experience
of the fiscal and economic crises of the late 1990s in
Asia and Latin America prompted many countries to
reconsider their economic models. The new policies recognize a more active role of the State in fostering social
and economic development and strengthening domestic demand. The strong emphasis on social protection
policies in many middle-income countries is a powerful
testimony to the premise that sustainable and equitable growth cannot be achieved in the absence of strong
social protection policies and the progressive extension
of social security coverage to much larger groups of the
population (ILO, 2010b; ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2012a).
Several middle-income countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Namibia,
South Africa and Thailand, have significantly extended
various elements of their social protection systems,
particularly since the early 2000s, with remark­able
outcomes (see, e.g. Fiszbein and Schady, 2009; ILO,
2010b; ISSA, 2013). These efforts were temporarily disrupted in some parts of the world by the global crisis,
the effects of which compounded those the food and
fuel crises in various ways. Some countries rebounded
after 2010 in terms of economic growth, but still saw an
increase in vulnerable and informal employment, and
their economic positions remain exposed to the uncertain recovery of global demand.
Several countries, which recently joined the ranks
of middle-income countries or graduated from least
developed country status, such as Cabo Verde, Ghana,
Lesotho and Zambia, have implemented distinct social
protection policies aiming at gradually extending social

protection to larger groups of the population, in so far
as available national and external resources allow, as
part of their development strategies.
Many reforms have focused on non-contributory
schemes and programmes, such as conditional or unconditional cash transfers for children and families,
social pensions, and/or employment guarantee schemes.
Many countries have also rendered their social insurance programmes more equitable, more effective and
more sustainable, although many are also still struggling to bring the majority of informal workers, especially in rural areas into the formal economy. These
reforms contributed to further extension of national
social protection systems, while ensuring that at least
a minimum level of social security is guaranteed in the
form of a national social protection floor.
Table 6.3 and the map in figure 6.6 above illustrate
the wide range of recent efforts to extend social protection in middle-income countries, both through the
introduction of new schemes and programmes and the
significant expansion of existing ones.
The large number of middle-income countries that
have extended social protection demonstrates a significant prioritization of social protection policies in this
group of countries in recent years, highlighted by the
fact that many middle-income countries have also significantly expanded the envelope of resources allocated
to social protection.
Good rates of economic development have contributed to the observed significant increases in social
protection expenditure ratios in many middle-income
countries, although a wide variation in expenditure
levels persists. Since 2000, 14 out of the 32 countries

included in figure 6.17 have increased the proportion
of GDP invested in public social protection (including
health) by more than 3 per cent of GDP.
6.3.2 Towards more inclusive growth
Many middle-income countries have enjoyed relatively
high rates of economic growth since 2000. This growth
has helped to enlarge fiscal space, broaden the revenue
base of the State and facilitated the strengthening of
public administrations, all of which are conducive to
the extension of social protection. Taking advantage
of this opportunity, some Latin American and Asian
economies, having learnt from the financial crises they
faced in the 1980s, late 1990s and again in the early
2000s, have been expanding social protection mechanisms to better protect the most vulnerable groups of
their population, and to enable the population to better
cope with social risks and contingencies.
Most importantly, the crisis has triggered a shift
in the way developing countries see the relationship
between growth and social protection. When emerging
economies found demand for their exports falling, policy-makers started questioning unsustainable export-led
growth models and moving instead towards recovery
strategies centred on building up domestic consumption and internal markets. One way to raise household
income and thereby domestic consumption is through
improved social protection systems.

With the aim of moving economies on to a more
sustainable development path, the extension of social
protection has been seen as an investment to foster
a healthier, better educated and more highly skilled
workforce capable of responding to new demands
and to support the transition to the higher levels of
productivity necessary to sustain economic growth
(ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2014b; see also figures 6.23 and
6.24 below). Such measures can contribute to overcoming a “middle income trap” of stagnating growth due
to unbalanced growth trajectories (IMF, 2013c; Aiyar
et al., 2013). The expansion of effective social protection
mechanisms for the whole population, particularly for
the middle classes, is also considered to be an effective
way to counter disproportionately high precautionary
savings rates, which can hold back aggregate domestic
demand and contribute to global imbalances (Padoan,
2010; Social Protection Floor Advisory Group, 2011).
In fact, many middle-income countries have pursued the expansion of their social protection systems explicitly with the objective of investing in human capital
and human capabilities, with a view to achieving more
sustainable and inclusive growth.
The expansion of social protection coverage in
Brazil (see box 6.4), China (see box 6.5) and Thailand
are particularly instructive examples, as in these cases
the extension of social security coverage was embedded
in a broader approach aimed at moving the economy
to a more inclusive and more sustainable growth pattern, which included also measures to reform minimum

6. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

Box 6.4  The role of social protection in the Brazilian model of domestic demand-led growth
When the financial crisis hit Brazil in 2008, the Brazilian economy, which had hitherto benefited greatly
from favourable terms of trade and growing exports of commodities, suffered severely from a sharp decline
in exports and a credit crunch among private Brazilian banks. This resulted in a loss of 695,000 formal jobs
in November and December 2008 (see CAGED/IPEADATA) and a fall in GDP of 4.4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 2008 (Berg and Tobin, 2011, p. 5). To counterbalance the decline in exports, the government
responded with a strategy of domestic demand-led growth. This strategy had two pillars: boosting domestic
consumption by increasing family incomes and stimulating domestic investments. To the latter end, a
fiscal stimulus package of US$20 billion (1.2 per cent of GDP) was launched, focusing on investments in
infrastructure and the establishment of credit lines for sectors experiencing difficulties. To support domestic
demand, tax cuts for middle-income households and social policies focusing on the poorest were financed
through the stimulus package. Besides guaranteeing the maintenance of the existing social protection
programmes and compliance with previous commitments, the Government extended the conditional cash
transfer programme Bolsa Família to 1.3 million additional extremely poor families; in addition, the duration
of unemployment insurance payments was extended by two months for people who had been working in
sectors strongly hit by the crisis, benefiting some 310,000 people. Although quantitatively the investments
in social protection seem comparably small, accounting for only 2.4 per cent of the stimulus package, the
existing comprehensive network of social policies allowed for a quick reaction at low cost by means of
scaling up relevant programmes; this had a very significant impact, reaching over 1.6 million of the most
vulnerable people. Outside the stimulus package, the Government also maintained the real increases in the
official minimum wage scheduled for February 2009 and January 2010. It is estimated that in 2009 this
affected more than 20 per cent of the population, principally those on lower incomes.
Social policies and increases in the minimum wage thus helped to maintain or even increase the incomes
of the poorest, and this in turn contributed to domestic demand growth. Despite a decrease in GDP in
2009 of 0.6 per cent, private consumption remained stable and in the second half of 2009 was already
beginning to grow again (Berg and Tobin, 2011, p. 7). This had multiplier effects on the economy, boosting
employment and incomes and contributing substantially to its recovery. By 2010, GDP had grown again by
an impressive 7.5 per cent (IMF, 2013a). The stronger accent on domestic-led growth has not broken the
prevailing trend in reducing inequality, as shown by the continued drop of the Gini index from 0.54 in 2008
to 0.526 in 2012 (IPEA, 2013, p. 11). Thus, by boosting the incomes of the lower and middle classes, social
protection helped mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable and functioned as an important
element of the domestic demand-led growth policy implemented by the Brazilian Government as a response
to the crisis. The case of Brazil also proves that income policies can promote economic growth while reducing poverty and inequality.

wages. These countries have implemented a package of
economic and social policies combining contributory
and non-contributory programmes to reinforce their
national social protection floors and strengthen their
social security systems. These have been coordinated
with employment policies, and particular emphasis has
been placed on making the benefits and services accessible to the population through an integrated approach. These governments have not focused exclusively
on reducing poverty by targeting social protection
measures on the poorest, but have pursued a broader
strategy, which also helped low income earners and the
middle classes to improve their living standards sustainably. These cases highlight the importance of coherent
strategies that embed social policies in a wider range
of coordinated employment, labour market, fiscal and
macroeconomic policies.
While some middle-income countries have managed to reduce inequalities significantly, more efforts

are necessary in this area (UNDP, 2014; UN, 2013b).
Here the social protection system plays a particularly
important role as one of the channels through which
the benefits of growth can be shared in a more equitable way: not only in its direct impact on redistribution
through social transfers and contributions, but also in
more indirect ways by facilitating access to health and
education. Investing in the extension of social protection, as many middle-income countries have done, helps
to contain inequality and its negative effects on growth,
and allow countries to follow a more equitable and more
sustainable growth path (e.g. Berg and Ostry, 2011;
Ostry et al., 2014). Such an approach is, indeed, particularly relevant for middle-income countries, which
now are the home of the majority of the world’s poor
(Sumner, 2010). In this context, social protection mechanisms play a particularly important role in reducing
and preventing poverty, containing inequality, ensuring
equitable life chances and fostering social inclusion.

Box 6.5  Strengthening domestic demand-led growth in China through increased wages
and an expansion of social protection benefits

144

Since the middle of the century’s first decade, China’s five-year plans have recognized the need to address
rapidly growing income inequalities and to provide income security to all the people of China, who place
great trust in the public social security system.
Income disparities between the rural and urban populations, between its more developed and less developed regions, among various groups of the population and among different sectors of the economy have
been a recurrent concern of the national authorities. The other key social challenges in China are providing
for income security, ensuring equal and affordable access to health, education and housing, and generating
enough employment for both urban and rural populations. From the economic perspective, strengthening
aggregate domestic demand and consumption has become one of the national priorities since the start of
the global economic crisis, given the consequent lower demand for Chinese exports.
The Government has clearly seen the links between these economic and social challenges and decided
to address them as closely as possible. The rapid economic growth China has experienced since the late
1970s has built up the country’s economic and fiscal capacity for the expansion of its social security
system. Accordingly, alongside the economic expansion strategy, priority has been given to the following
initiatives, among others:
•	 In 2003 and 2007, two new social health insurance schemes were established for, respectively, the
rural population and the previously uninsured part of the urban population. These, together with other
existing health insurance schemes, now cover a total of 1.34 billion people, more than 96 per cent of the
population.
•	 The adequacy of health insurance benefits was improved to ensure equal and effective access to health
care. This took several forms, such as increasing reimbursement rates, extending the range of reimbursable items, raising the cap for reimbursement, introducing insurance for high out-of-pocket payments,
reforming the public health sector, and investing more in rural health facilities and urban communitybased health centres.
•	 In 2009 and 2011, two new old-age pension schemes were introduced, again for the rural population and
uninsured urban residents. The goal was to achieve universal coverage by 2020; in fact, this was already
reached in 2012. The total number of those insured under these two new schemes was 498 million at the
end of 2013, including 138 million pensioners. Together with those covered under the existing schemes,
the overall number of insured (including beneficiaries) amounted to 820 million, more than 80 per cent
of the population over 18 years old.
•	 Both the new health and the new pension schemes are highly subsidized by the Government. For instance, the annual fiscal contribution to health insurance for uninsured urban residents was raised from
40 yuan renminbi (CNY) per person in 2007 (as against CNY60 for the insured) to CNY280 in 2013, and
is planned to rise again to CNY320 for 2014.
•	 The level of pension paid under the urban workers’ pension system has been increased consecutively for
ten years (2005–14) at an annual rate of 10 per cent to secure its purchasing power.
•	 The overall amount of social insurance benefits paid out in 2013 amounted to CNY2.8 trillion –a nearly
threefold increase from its 2007 level – representing a major contribution to domestic-led growth.
•	 The minimum living standard guarantee programme has achieved the goal of universal coverage since
2007, making an essential contribution to the reduction of poverty and inequality.
As a result of these and other initiatives, social security expenditure has grown constantly, contributing to
increases in disposable income for millions of households and supporting China’s sustainable economic
development.

Given the slowing rates of economic growth in
many middle-income countries (IMF, 2013a) and the
potentially detrimental effects of ill-designed fiscal consolidation policies, continued efforts are essential to
strengthen social security systems and expand them
in two dimensions: guaranteeing at least basic levels of
social security to all through national social protection
floors, and progressively reaching higher levels of social

security that effectively prevent vulnerability and respond to the social security needs of the middle classes,
which are often neglected by conventional poverty reduction policies (e.g. Birdsall, 2010).

Low-income countries face stronger constraints in extending social protection coverage than middle- and
high-income countries. Typically, they face higher
levels of poverty and destitution that have to be addressed with fewer financial resources, through weaker
institutional capacities and within often fragile contexts. Nonetheless, a number of low-income countries
have also taken decisive steps towards the extension of
social protection in various areas (see figure 6.6 above
and table 6.4). Rwanda, for example, thoroughly reformed its health system in order to ensure effective
access for more than 90 per cent of the population
to health services and improved the quality of health
services provided; this has contributed to a rapid decrease in maternal and child mortality (Sekabaraga
et al., 2011). Bangladesh, Kenya and Malawi are among
the countries that have introduced conditional cash
transfer programmes, which contributed to enhancing
income security and access to education for the targeted vulnerable households in difficult contexts where
public services and delivery capacities were sometimes
too limited even to meet food security emergencies
(García and Moore, 2012; Monchuk, 2014). In Nepal,
the extension of social pension coverage has enhanced
income security for older women and men. In Mozambique, a large cash transfer programme has improved
income security for vulnerable households, many of
which include older persons and children (Cunha

et al., 2013). In Ethiopia, Malawi and Niger, among
other countries, public employment programmes contribute to enhancing income security for workers in
rural areas during the lean season (McCord, 2012;
Lieuw-Kie-Song, 2011). Although the coverage of
some of these programmes is limited to certain geographic areas or narrowly defined groups of the population, they constitute an important investment in the
health, nutrition, education and productive capacities of the population, and have generated significant
effects in reducing poverty and vulnerability and improving living standards.

As a result of these efforts, many low-income countries have significantly increased the share of GDP that
they invest in social protection (including health) (see
figure 6.18). This reflects an important shift in development priorities towards a stronger emphasis on human
development.
Poor households, including the working poor, face
insecurity in countries that provide no basic guarantee of income security and health care through social
protection mechanisms. Many poor people work in
the rural informal economy, where they depend largely
on the income they can earn from selling their crops.
From an economic perspective, the lack of social protection coverage leads to inefficient use of resources,
forcing poor rural households to opt for low-risk, lowreturn crops, to hold liquid but less productive assets,
and/or to withdraw children from school in response
to crises.19 The absence of insurance or other forms of
protection can thus lead to chronic poverty, or to a situation in which people can easily fall back into poverty
in the event of shocks and thus are not in a position
to improve their situation in a sustainable manner.
Social transfers can contribute to improving household
income security by stabilizing and protecting consumption, which in turn can facilitate investment (ILO,
2010b).
In recent years, social protection policies have been
actively promoted in low-income countries, in recognition of their role in reducing chronic poverty and
vulnerability, and in contributing to the attainment of
economic and social development objectives. Emphasis has been placed on the role of social protection in
enhancing nutrition, health and education outcomes,
particularly for children, and in strengthening human
resources and capabilities (see figures 6.23 and 6.24
below). More recently, stress has also been placed on the
economic role of social protection in stabilizing household consumption, boosting aggregate demand and
stimulating local markets, particularly in remote areas.
Simulations of cash transfers in Ethiopia and Kenya
demonstrate that the aggregate real benefit to the local
economy is significantly higher than the actual amount
of the transfer itself (FAO, 2014; Taylor, Thome and
Davis, 2013). For many low-income countries, a particular challenge remains in shifting spending from
security to social protection: a recent IMF study on Afghanistan found that there is a balance to be achieved

between security and social spending in order to optimize the chances of establishing and maintaining social
peace (Aslam, Berkes and Fukač, 2013).
These developments have shifted perceptions of
social protection policies in low-income countries away
from the assumption that they represent a cost (often
assumed to be unaffordable) to an understanding that
they constitute an “investment in people” that is in fact
indispensable for future development (Cichon et al.,
2006; ILO, 2008a; Monchuk, 2014). As a result of this
shift, recent policies have placed a stronger emphasis on
social and human development, with a focus on reducing extreme poverty and promoting “pro-poor growth”
(e.g. OECD, 2009a); some concentrated attention on
targeted safety-net approaches, while others have gone
further to promote inclusive growth (e.g. ILO, 2011a).
Integrated development policies are crucial to foster
synergies between the provision of cash transfers, access
to health and other social services, and public investment. For example, a number of French-speaking African countries have implemented measures to ensure
universal effective access to health care for children and
young mothers. While these have had a notable impact,
they could have been even more successful if they had
been coupled with more effective measures to improve
and scale up the supply, and improve the accessibility
and quality, of health services. Such measures could include the strengthening of public health infrastructure
through public employment programmes that also provide employment opportunities and strengthen income
security for vulnerable populations.
6.4.2 Expanding social protection using
proceeds from fiscal consolidation
and adjustment measures
The expansion of social protection in developing
countries began well before the global financial and
economic crisis, and then gathered pace as the crisis
led to an acceleration of investments in social protection. This was possible in part because some countries
had benefited from the recent boom in commodity
prices; however, many developing countries financed
expansion of social protection from the proceeds of adjustment measures such as the reduction of subsidies,
increased taxes on consumption taxes, such as VAT, and

Group, 2011.

cost savings from reforms in the pension and social protection systems, as set out in section 6.2.2 above. The
net welfare effects vary from country to country and
have not yet been adequately studied.
During the food and fuel crisis, many developing
countries increased subsidies or cut taxes on food and/
or fuel (IMF, 2008); however, more recently 78 developing countries started to reverse food and energy subsidies, despite the lack of any clear indication that local
food and energy prices had fallen or that any compensatory social protection floor had been successfully put
in place. This trend was largely driven by the orthodox logic that generalized subsidies can be ineffective
and costly, and that replacing them with targeted safety
nets can remove market distortions and support vulnerable groups more cost-effectively (Coady et al., 2010).
Thus the IMF standard strategy recommended reducing
energy subsidies (IMF, 2013b), a policy which in principle can have positive environmental impacts – one
reason why UN agencies have supported this policy in
countries such as Mozambique (see box 6.6).
There are, however, some important policy implications that must be taken into account when considering
a focus on subsidy removal and benefits targeted on the
poorest.
•	 While subsidies can be removed overnight, developing a social protection system takes a long time, particularly in countries where institutional capacity is
limited. Thus there is a high risk that subsidies may
be withdrawn and populations left unprotected,
without compensation through adequate social
protection mechanisms, so that food and energy
become unaffordable for many households, in particular, but not only, the poorest ones.
Box 6.6  Mozambique: Using a fuel subsidy
to extend social protection
In Mozambique, the Government has worked together with the ILO, the IMF, UNICEF, other UN
agencies and the World Bank to reprioritize expenditure and to ensure sufficient resources are available
for the building of a national social protection floor.
A joint ILO–IMF study (Cunha et al., 2013) concluded
that progressively expanding a social protection floor
did not present a threat to fiscal sustainability. The
study recommended that the ill-targeted fuel subsidy be replaced by a more effective social protection
system. Revenues from the booming natural resource
sector have the potential to widen the available fiscal
space for such provision. The Government envisages
making a budget allocation of around 0.8 per cent
of GDP for the social protection floor over 2014–16.

•	 Targeting the poor excludes other vulnerable households and may lead to poor developmental outcomes. Designing a safety net for the poor alone
may leave unprotected many non-wealthy households that benefited from subsidies. The removal of
fuel subsidies and consequent increases in energy
prices to unaffordable levels have sparked protests in many countries, e.g. Algeria, Cameroon,
Chile, India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Peru, Sudan
and Uganda (Ortiz et al., 2013; Zaid et al., 2014).
Recent studies, including some by the IMF, point
out that income inequality is a gross obstacle to development, especially while global recovery remains
fragile and many developing countries are trying to
develop their internal markets to encourage national
demand. A safety net for the poorest is by no means
a sufficient response to these challenges.
•	 The large cost savings resulting from reductions in
energy subsidies should allow countries to develop
comprehensive social protection systems: fuel subsidies are large, but new safety nets tend to be small
in scope and cost. For example, in Ghana, the eliminated fuel subsidy would have cost over US$1 billion in 2013, whereas the well-targeted LEAP
programme costs about US$20 million per year.
•	 Subsidy reforms are complex and their social impacts need to be properly assessed, and discussed
within the framework of national dialogue, so that
the net welfare effects are understood and reforms
are agreed before any subsidies are removed.
6.4.3 Beyond safety nets: Towards national
social protection floors
The extension of social protection programmes in lowincome countries has contributed greatly to accelerating social and economic development, and to progress
towards the achievement of the MDGs (UN, 2013b).
In addition, greater recognition is now given to the
wider functions of social protection with regard to the
realization of human rights, the containment of inequality and income insecurity, and the promotion of
social cohesion. At the same time, low-income countries face certain specific constraints, including limited
fiscal space, the unpredictability of external aid and
weak institutional capacity, including with regard to
tax systems. Economists often counsel governments
in these countries to target social protection more

148

narrowly as a way to reconcile poverty reduction with
fiscal consolidation (Ravallion, 1999), a line of advice
that has been particularly prevalent in the current recession and slow growth period. As a result, social protection programmes are often implemented in the form
of temporary, small-scale safety net programmes, often
narrowly targeted and/or limited to certain geographical areas. Allocating scarce resources to respond to the
social protection needs of the population in a context
of widespread poverty is a challenge, particularly with
regard to establishing eligibility criteria that are equitable and transparent, and protect the dignity of the
intended beneficiaries. It is important to bear in mind
that people who manage to climb out of poverty are at
high risk of falling back into poverty. In rural Ethiopia, between 1999 and 2009, less than 40 per cent of
those who escaped poverty managed to remain above
the poverty line (Chronic Poverty Advisory Network,
2014, p. 77).
While programmes of the safety-net type initially
offer social protection to those targeted, their effectiveness is often hampered by their lack of foundations
in national legislation and of stable, reliable sources
of funding. Few low-income countries provide rightsbased entitlements with clear definitions of eligibility
criteria and type and level of benefits. Targeting social
programmes on the extreme poor, excluding most of
the poor and vulnerable households who are also in
need of public assistance, is a politically difficult and
administratively complicated enterprise.
In many countries, there is a marked cleavage
between contributory and non-contributory schemes.
Whereas social insurance schemes are often perceived
as catering to the interests of the (often small) number
of employees in the formal economy, non-contributory
schemes (means tested or not) tend to be considered
as part of poverty reduction policies. By better coordinating and combining contributory and non-contributory programmes, countries can find more effective
ways not only to reduce poverty, but also to prevent
impoverishment, keep those who escape poverty from
falling back into it, and enhance economic security for
the entire population. Comprehensive and well-coordinated social protection systems are therefore a major
component of an integrated policy package to address
chronic and recurrent poverty.
Some low-income countries have made great strides
in improving coordination of existing social protection programmes, bringing them under a common
strategic framework owned by the Government and
developed with the participation of key stakeholders,

and strengthening national legal, institutional and
fiscal frameworks, so as to render national social security systems more effective, efficient, equitable and
sustainable. Such efforts reach beyond a narrow focus
on (often fragmented) safety nets, and aim at building
national social protection floors and social security systems (ILO, 2012a).
During times of crisis, it is important to scale up,
rather than scale down, social investments, and narrowly
targeted safety nets tend to represent a de facto reduction in coverage. Given the critical importance of supporting households in times of hardship, and of raising
people’s incomes in order to encourage socio-economic
recovery, a strong case can be made for the progressive
extension of universal transfers to (for example) families
with children, older persons, persons with disabilities
and other groups. Targeting social protection on the
poorest and excluding vulnerable populations as a conscious decision in policy design is inconsistent with the
United Nations Charter, the Millennium Declaration
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (according
to which everyone is entitled to minimum standards of
living, including food, clothing, education and social security), and conventions that have been signed by virtually every government across the world (e.g. UN, 2008;
Sepúlveda, 2014; Sepúlveda and Nyst, 2012).
A progressive expansion of social security provision requires, among other things, a strengthening of
legal frameworks and institutional capacities, as well
as a sustainable resource base, which in many cases will
be based on a combination of domestic and external
sources. Robust tax policies and tax administration are
essential for ensuring that governments can rely on a
sustainable and equitable resource base for their economic and social development policies. This is particularly important in resource-rich countries, in order to
ensure that the benefits of growth are equitably shared
and serve the needs of their populations (OECD,
2014a; Hujo and McClanahan, 2009; Hujo, 2012).
An approach that focuses on nationally owned and
rights-based solutions emphasizes the importance of
effective national social protection policies that can
support inclusive growth and sustainable social and
economic development, and contribute to the realization of human rights. In doing so, this approach
reaches beyond external development aid and shortterm safety-net policies, and contributes to ensuring
coherence between economic, employment and social
policies within a strong and sustainable legal and institutional framework (Townsend, 2009; Behrendt et al.,
2009). Such dedicated and nationally owned efforts

Contents

6. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

vary widely across the globe. It is a matter of political
choice (ILO, 2008a; Hall, 2010). Some countries opt
to spend more or less, as part of their social contract, as
shown in figure 6.19. As in spending decisions, there is
a similar disparity in how governments raise resources
for social and economic development. By utilizing all
possible options to expand fiscal space and invest in
their people, countries can achieve a virtuous circle of
sustained growth and social development, and avoid
the risk of a slow growth and weak human development
trap (Ryder, 2013; ILO, 2012e).
Today, the need to create and maintain fiscal space
for socio-economic investments has never been greater.
Given the significance of public investment in enhancing the prospects for equitable, inclusive economic
growth and social development, it is critical that governments explore options to increase social spending
and employment-generating economic investments.
Even the IMF Managing Director, recognizing the risk
that fiscal consolidation may jeopardize global recovery efforts, has called for “aggressive exploration of all
possible measures that could be effective in supporting
short-term growth” (Lagarde, 2011).
There are options available to governments to expand
fiscal space for a socially responsive recovery even in
the poorest countries – options that are all supported
by policy statements of the United Nations and international financial institutions (IMF and World Bank,
2006; ILO, 2009a; ILO, 2011a; ILO, 2012a; OECD,
2014a; UNDP, 2007; UN, 2009b; UN, 2013c). These

to strengthen institutional capacities have contributed
to enhancing development outcomes, for example in
Ethiopia and Rwanda. In other countries, particularly
those considered as fragile States, these challenges may
be even greater; however, social protection is among the
policy areas that can potentially contribute to strengthening the “social contract”, fostering national dialogue
and enhancing trust in the government and public institutions in general (e.g. Hickey, 2010).
If governments and other national actors pursue
these policies with commitment and in good faith, the
establishment and strengthening of national social protection floors will not only have an immediate impact
on people’s lives, but will also contribute to building
more inclusive societies and economies in the longer
term.

6.5 Fiscal space for social protection floors
It is often argued that social protection is not affordable or that government expenditure cuts are
inevitable during adjustment periods. But there are alternatives, even in the poorest countries. Finding fiscal
space for critical economic and social investments is essential if sustained and equitable development is to be
achieved, particularly during a recession and periods of
slow growth.
It is important to understand at the outset that governments’ options in respect of revenue and spending

include: (1) reallocating public expenditures, (2) increasing tax revenues, (3) extending social security contributions, (4) borrowing or restructuring existing debt,
(5) curtailing illicit financial flows, (6) drawing on increased aid and transfers, (7) tapping into fiscal and
foreign exchange reserves and/or (8) adopting a more
accommodating macroeconomic framework (Hujo
and McClanahan, 2009; Durán-Valverde and Pacheco,
2012; Ortiz and Cummins, 2012). Normally a government would carve out its own fiscal space from a few of
these options. The uniqueness of each country requires
that the range of options be carefully examined at the
national level and the selection based on effective social
dialogue and a sound approach to political economy
(ILO, 2012a).

150

6.5.1 Option 1: Reallocating current
public expenditures
This is the most orthodox option, which includes assessing ongoing budget allocations, replacing high-cost,
low-impact investments with those that can generate
larger socio-economic impacts, eliminating spending
inefficiencies and/or tackling corruption. Reprioritization requires that governments be prepared to reconsider what areas of public policy require most support.
For example, governments in Cambodia, Costa Rica,
Mauritius and Sri Lanka have reduced expenditures in
the defence and security sectors in favour of increased
spending in social sectors. One area of expenditure
with great potential in creating fiscal space is subsidies.
Removing subsidies has allowed expansion of social

Box 6.7  Financing social protection from subsidy removal
Since 2010, 100 governments have been considering removing food and fuel subsidies and replacing them
with safety nets targeted on the poor, including 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 22 in HICs, 12 in East
Asia and the Pacific, 11 in Latin America, nine in the Middle East and North Africa, and six in South Asia.
The IMF’s standard policy advice is to phase out energy subsidies (IMF, 2013b), a course of action that in
principle has positive environmental externalities. However, the quick removal of subsidies – a main element
of fiscal consolidation in developing countries – has led to significant protests against the resulting in higher
food and fuel prices (Ortiz et al., 2013). For example, in Nigeria, where the majority of the population lives
on less than US$2 per day, cheap petrol is viewed by many as the only tangible benefit they receive from
the State: hence the massive protests in 2012 when the Government removed a fuel subsidy that kept food
and transportation costs low.
There are three key lessons that Governments contemplating subsidy removal need to consider: (1) subsidy reforms are complex; there is no “one-size-fits-all” option, and the net welfare effect of any reform it its
national context must be properly understood and discussed in national dialogue. (2) designing a meagre
safety net for the poorest alone is an insufficient compensation mechanism if other households were also
benefiting from subsidies; the huge public savings reaped from cancelling energy subsidies should allow
governments to consider adequate universal social protection systems and other necessary development
policies that work for all citizens, not just for a few. (3) As food and energy prices hover near record highs,
scaling back subsidies should be avoided unless a well-functioning social protection system is already in
place that can protect households; such a system takes time to be developed, and if subsidies are withdrawn overnight, populations will be left unprotected during a period of exceptional vulnerability, as shown
by recent claims by civil society (Zaid et al., 2014).

Box 6.8  Taxing mineral and natural resource extraction to generate fiscal space for social protection
Taxing natural resource extraction offers great potential for many developing countries. While Norway’s approach of taxing oil profits and storing the revenues in the Government Pension Fund Global is perhaps the
best-known case, developing countries offer several innovative examples of channelling natural resource
revenue streams for social protection (Hujo, 2012; OECD, 2014a). For instance, Mongolia is financing a universal rights-based child benefit from taxation on copper exports. When copper prices dropped with falling
demand in 2009, Mongolia was advised to target its universal child benefit; this it refused to do, when in
2010/11 copper prices rise again. Given the volatile nature of primary commodity prices, many governments
have created “stabilization funds” based on windfall taxes. Such funds allow governments to smooth their
income and expenditure, saving the proceeds bonanza years for “rainy days” when prices of commodity
exports may be low, and hence ensuring that investments in social and economic development remain
constant. Examples include Chile’s Copper Stabilization Fund, Iran’s Oil Stabilization Fund and Papua New
Guinea’s Mineral Resources Stabilization Fund. During the recent economic downturn, a number of countries
have drawn on these funds to finance stimulus measures for national growth and increase social protection.

protection schemes in a number of countries, including
Mozambique and Ghana, though the net welfare effect
of any reform must be properly understood prior to removing subsidies (box 6.7).
6.5.2 Option 2: Increasing tax revenues
This may be achieved by altering various types of tax
rates, by strengthening the efficiency of tax-collection
methods, and by improving overall compliance. As
noted above, 94 countries are already increasing consumption taxes such as VAT, which are generally regressive as they cover products that the poor consume. The
focus should be shifted instead to other taxes, such as
those on corporate profits, financial activities, personal
income, property, imports or exports, which tend to be
progressive. Progressive taxation – the principal redistribution tool available to policy-makers – should be
prioritized on grounds of both fiscal space and equity
in order to enlist the political support of citizens and
promote socio-economic recovery (IMF, 2010c; Ostry
et al., 2014).
6.5.3 Option 3: Extending social security
contributions
Generating funding through social contributions is by
its nature associated with the extension of contributory
social security schemes. Many countries in recent years
have increased social protection financing significantly

by this means, including Brazil, China, Costa Rica,
Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Thailand. In
most countries, these initiatives are closely associated
with the introduction of new measures to bring more
workers into formal employment and to expand the
coverage of contributory social security schemes.
6.5.4 Option 4: Borrowing or restructuring
existing debt
Some countries have potential capacity to borrow
(through loans or bond issues); other already have large
debts and need better debt management. Debt restructuring is the process of reducing existing levels of debt
or debt service charges. For those countries suffering
from high levels of debt, restructuring existing debt
may be possible and justifiable if the legitimacy of the
debt is questionable (e.g. nationalized private sector
debts) and/or the opportunity cost in terms of worsening growth and living standards is high (box 6.9). Five
main options are available to governments seeking to
restructure sovereign debt: (1) renegotiating debt (as
more than 60 countries have done since the 1990s),
(2) achieving debt relief/cancellation (e.g. under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative or HIPC,
introduced in 1996), (3) entering into debt swaps/
conversions (as done by more than 50 countries since
1980s), (4) repudiating debt (as Iraq and Iceland have
done), or (5) defaulting (done by more than 20 countries since 1999, including Argentina and the Russian
Federation). There is ample experience of governments

Box 6.9  Ecuador: Using resources freed up
by debt restructuring for social protection
Some developing countries have re-examined accumulated debts dating back to the 1970s in order to
decrease their outstanding obligations. In 2008, Ecuador became the first country to hold an official audit
to assess the legitimacy of its sovereign debt. The government-commissioned, two-year-long investigation
concluded that some of its foreign debts (mostly private sector debts nationalized by former governments)
had broken multiple principles of international and domestic law and were therefore “illegitimate”. While
Ecuador respected all of the debt that had contributed to the country’s development – the so-called “legitimate” debt – it defaulted on its alleged illegitimate debt in November 2008 and bought it back at 35 cents
to the dollar just a few weeks later.
On the basis of the Ecuadorean (and also the Norwegian) experience, a special United Nations Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System came out in support
of public debt audits as a mechanism for transparent and fair restructuring of debts (UN, 2009b). The
public resources freed up in Ecuador by this method were invested in human development, which included
doubling education spending between 2006 and 2009, nearly doubling housing assistance programmes for
low-income families and expanding its main social protection programme, the cash transfer Bono de Desarrollo Humano (human development bond). The results are impressive: poverty fell from a recession peak
of 36.0 per cent to 28.6 per cent, unemployment dropped from 9.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent and school
enrolment rates rose significantly (Ray and Kozameh, 2012).

restructuring debt or reducing debt service payments,
often against opposition from creditors. The IMF has
proposed a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism
(Kruger, 2002; IMF, 2003), and the United Nations
has also called for a mechanism for the reduction of sovereign debt that deals fairly with lenders and borrowers
alike (UN, 2009b; UN, 2010b).
6.5.5 Option 5: Curtailing illicit financial flows

Curtailing illicit financial flows (IFFs) also has the potential to generate large amounts of additional resources
for socio-economic investments, including social protection. IFFs involve capital that is illegally earned,
transferred or used and include, inter alia, traded goods
that are mispriced to avoid higher tariffs, wealth funnelled to offshore accounts to evade income taxes and
unreported movements of cash (UNDP, 2011). It is
estimated that in 2009 US$1.3 trillion in IFFs moved
out of developing countries, mostly through trade mispricing, of which nearly two-thirds ended up in highincome countries; this amounts to more than ten times
the total amount of aid received by developing countries (figure 6.20).

6.5.6 Option 6: Drawing on increased aid
and transfers
This requires either engaging with different donor governments in order to increase North–South or South–
South transfers, or reducing South–North transfers,
such as IFFs, which are significantly larger (see above).
As a result of the fiscal consolidation policies adopted
in most donor countries, development aid fell by 4 per
cent in real terms in 2012, following a 2 per cent fall
in 2011 (OECD, 2013e). In 2012, the United Nations
Special Rapporteurs for the Right to Food, and for Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, called for a global
fund for social protection to redress the balance (De
Schutter and Sepúlveda, 2012).
6.5.7 Option 7: Using fiscal and central bank
foreign exchange reserves
This includes drawing down fiscal savings and other
state revenues stored in special funds, such as sovereign
wealth funds, and/or using excess foreign exchange reserves in the central bank for domestic and regional
development. A more detailed discussion of this option
can be found in Ortiz and Cummins, 2012; here there
is space only to highlight the case of sovereign wealth
funds (SWFs), which can potentially be used for national socio-economic development and social protection. The logic behind SWFs – such as the Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority, Norway’s Government Pension
Fund Global, and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and
Government of Singapore Investment Corporation – is
to maximize financial returns on investment, usually in
international capital markets. While creating an SWF
is an option available to most governments, many have
questioned the logic of investing earned public income
for capital market growth when those resources could
be invested in social and economic goods and services
urgently needed at home. The Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, for example, has used its fiscal reserves to finance a number of development objectives both domestically and regionally. On the other hand, Timor-Leste,
a country with very low scores on human indicators of
development and a high proportion of people living in
poverty (50 per cent in 2007, up from 36 per cent in
2001), has an estimated US$6.3 billion stored in an
SWF investing overseas. The key point is that governments have multiple options in how to use their reserves
for socio-economic development, and the alternatives
should be carefully evaluated (see box 6.8).

Contents

6. Expanding social protection: Key to crisis recovery, inclusive development and social justice

6.5.8 Option 8: Adopting a more accommodating
macroeconomic framework
This entails allowing for higher budget deficits and
higher levels of inflation without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability (e.g. through quantitative easing
in the United States). The goals of macroeconomic
policy are multiple, from supporting growth, price
stabilization or inflation control to smoothing economic cycles, reducing unemployment and poverty,
and promoting equity. In recent decades, macroeconomic frameworks have placed strong emphasis on
short-term stabilization measures, such as controlling
inflation and fiscal deficits, as part of broader efforts
aimed at liberalizing economies, integrating them
into global markets and attracting investment. While
these macroeconomic objectives are not necessarily
unsound, there is an increasing risk in many developing countries that other important objectives, such as
employment-generating growth and social protection,
lose priority and come to be underemphasized. It is
important to underscore that there are diverse views
on what constitutes an “acceptable” level of inflation
or fiscal deficits, and that, as part of the crisis response,
there has been a growing recognition of the need to
ease budget constraints and allow for an increasing
degree of deficit spending, especially to support socially relevant investments and employment-generating
economic growth (IMF, 2009; Epstein, 2009; Pollin,
Epstein and Heintz, 2008; Islam and Chowdhury,

2010a; Islam and Chowdhury, 2010b; UNCTAD,
2011; UNCTAD, 2012; UNCTAD, 2013).
In summary, there are ample opportunities for
countries to increase fiscal space for social protection
through a combination of tailored strategies. Usually
it is appropriate for governments to consider a mix of
the different strategies, as in the examples presented in
table 6.5. Each country is unique, and the full range of
available fiscal space options should be carefully examined – with close attention to the potential risks and
trade-offs associated with each opportunity – at the
national level through an inclusive dialogue to ensure
a socially responsive recovery. All of the fiscal space options described in this report are supported by policy
statements of the United Nations and international
financial institutions. ILO Recommendation No. 202
emphasizes the responsibility of national governments
in financing national social protection floors, and in
mobilizing the necessary resources to ensure the financial, fiscal and economic sustainability of these arrangements. The Recommendation also notes explicitly that
national resource mobilization strategies may include
the effective enforcement of tax and contribution obligations, reprioritizing expenditure, and/or a broader
and sufficiently progressive revenue base. The Recommendation further states that countries whose economic and fiscal capacities are insufficient to implement
the guarantees may seek international cooperation and
support to complement their own efforts (Paras 11–12;
see also ILO, 2012a).

6.6 Why social protection floors are key
to recovery and must be part of
the post-2015 development agenda
As the global community struggles to emerge from recession and slow growth, and assesses the current development agenda and the progress made towards the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it
is high time to recall the three main reasons why social
protection is one of the necessary conditions for sustainable development. First, it is a human right and a
core element of labour rights. It is also a social and political necessity, as States need a capacity to intervene where
markets have failed; effective national social protection
systems are powerful tools to provide income security,
to prevent and reduce poverty and inequality and to
build inclusive society; thus they strengthen social cohesion and contribute to establishing and maintaining
social peace. Social protection is also an economic necessity to sustain domestic consumption and demand
by raising household income. Adequate social protection enhances productivity and human development,
­enables workers to adapt to change, and facilitates
equitable and inclusive structural change. Investing in
social protection is investing in a healthy, productive
and equitable society.

Social protection reduces poverty
and social exclusion
Social protection is a crucial instrument in addressing
all forms of poverty. Cash transfer schemes have successfully reduced poverty in Africa, Asia, Central and
Eastern Europe, and Latin America, potentially delivering much faster results than those expected from the
“trickle-down” effects of economic policies. Although in
practice benefits have tended to be lower than needed,
a cash transfer at an adequate level can bring people out
of poverty overnight. Equally importantly, cash transfers have had even larger effects on reducing the depth
of poverty. For example, South Africa’s non-contributory grants have reduced the poverty gap by more than
one-third (Woolard, Harttgen and Klasen, 2010), the
Oportunidades programme in Mexico has reduced the
numbers living in poverty by 10 per cent and the poverty gap by 30 per cent (Skoufias and Parker, 2001),
and Kyrgyzstan’s Social Protection Programme has reduced the number of people living in extreme poverty
by 24 per cent and the poverty gap among beneficiaries by 42 per cent (World Bank, 2003). The expansion
of food assistance in the United States is reported to
have reduced the number of households in extreme poverty by half (CBPP, 2014). Overall, social transfers and

Public social protection expenditure as % of GDP

Notes: R2 = 0.5326. The relationship between public social protection expenditure and poverty outcomes is complex, involving a variety of factors.
It should be noted in particular that US$2 PPP per day does not represent a meaningful absolute poverty line in high-income countries; this cut-off
point was selected for the purpose of the graph to ensure international comparability.

Public social protection expenditure as % of GDP

Notes:R2 = 0.3893. Again, the relationship between social protection policies (measured here by expenditure) and inequality (here measured by
Gini coefficient) is much more complex than can be captured here. Well-designed social protection policies address not only income inequality,
but also various other dimensions of inequality (see e.g. UNRISD, 2010; OECD, 2011b; UNDP, 2014).
Sources: Public social protection expenditure: based on data from IMF, OECD, Eurostat, ILO, CEPALSTAT, ADB and national sources (see Annex IV,
table B.12). Gini index: World Bank, World Development Indicators (accessed Jan. 2014); ADB, CEPAL; Solt, 2009; Solt, 2013).

taxation have reduced poverty by more than 50 per cent
in most European countries (see figure 6.16 above).
Social protection expenditure has a prominent role
in reducing and preventing poverty, containing inequality and addressing social exclusion. Particularly
crucial is its capacity to ensure that people can escape
poverty for good: the risk of falling back into poverty is
very high where effective social protection mechanisms
do not exist (Chronic Poverty Advisory Network, 2014).
Social protection is essential in addressing not only
monetary poverty but also social exclusion (Babajanian
and Hagen-Zanker, 2012). Indeed, social protection
constitutes one of the essential channels through which
governments can distribute and redistribute income and
resources, and share the benefits of growth, reinforcing
the democratic mandates granted them on election to
fulfil societal expectations. The key role of social protection in inclusive growth is now widely recognized
(e.g. OECD, 2009a). It is therefore not surprising that
higher levels of social protection expenditure are associated with lower levels of poverty (see figure 6.21).

Social protection reduces income inequality
The role of social protection reaches far beyond a mere
reduction of income poverty. While debate has for
some time focused narrowly on poverty reduction and

the efficiency of targeting, it is increasingly acknowledged that the reduction of poverty is not sufficient to
promote inclusive growth (UNDP, 2013; UN, 2013d;
UN, 2013e). Broader social protection policies encompassing approaches such as extending social insurance
are needed to help prevent poverty and insecurity and
to contain inequality (figure 6.22). The correlation
between public social protection expenditure and inequality (as expressed by the Gini coefficient) is less
strong than for poverty, but there is still a distinct relationship, suggesting that higher levels of social protection expenditure are associated with lower levels of
inequality.

Social protection contributes to human capital
development, reduces hunger and contributes
to food security
There is strong evidence of the positive impacts of
social protection on hunger and nutrition. In Africa,
Asia and Latin America, cash transfers have been
shown to improve both the quantity and the diversity
of food consumption, and to protect food consumption during shocks or lean periods. Better nutrition
also contributes to better physical development: programmes in Mexico, Malawi, and Colombia all demonstrate reductions in the numbers of children with

155

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

stunted growth (Yablonski and O’Donnell, 2009;
Tirivayi, Knowles and Davis, 2013), while children in
South African households receiving a pension grow on
average 5 centimetres taller than those in households
without a pension (Case, 2001).

Social protection supports positive
education outcomes

156

Social protection programmes, including cash transfers, the supply of free tuition and materials, and school
feeding programmes, have all been shown to lead to
higher school enrolment rates, fewer school dropouts
and less child labour by removing demand-side barriers to education, including the need for poor families
to rely on children for income-earning and care work.
Transfer programmes in Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey have all demonstrated significant increases in children’s school enrolment and/or attendance (Adato and Bassett, 2008).

Social protection supports positive
health outcomes
Social protection can contribute to better and more
equal health outcomes in various ways. Investments in
health infrastructure, staff and drugs are most urgently
needed where the burden of illness is heaviest. Financial support is also needed to prevent families falling
into poverty because of heavy out-of-pocket health expenditures. A WHO cross-country study showed this
can be done by reducing the health system’s reliance
on OOP and providing more financial risk protection
(Xu, Evans and Kawabata, 2003). Thailand’s commitment to achieving universal access to health care led
to significant improvements in health outcomes on a
number of measures, including take-up of services and
the rate of health-related impoverishment (Evans et al.,
2012; Tangcharoensathien et al., 2009). The Oportunidades programme in Mexico combined cash transfers and free health services with improvements in the
supply of health services, leading to a 17 per cent decline in rural infant mortality over a three-year period
and an 11 per cent reduction in maternal mortality
rates (Barham, 2010; Adato and Bassett, 2008). In
Ghana, user fee exemptions for pregnant women led to
a significant reduction in the maternal mortality rate
(Witter et al., 2007). More recently, there is evidence

on the usefulness of broader social protection interventions in HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, and
care and support (ILO, 2008b; Temin, 2010). Cash
transfers, for example, were found effective in supporting families to care for people living with HIV/AIDS
and in improving access to treatment and adherence.
6.6.2 Social protection floors promote decent
employment and inclusive growth

Social protection promotes employment
Social protection plays a major role in creating access
to full and productive employment and decent work
for all, including women and young people, through
cash transfers, active labour market measures, health
insurance and family support policies. These have
been shown to encourage labour market participation
in low- and middle-income countries by guaranteeing
public work opportunities, covering the costs of jobseeking and supporting those with childcare responsibilities – with particularly strong effects for women. In
South Africa, labour market participation among those
receiving cash transfers was 13–17 per cent higher than
in similar non-recipient households, with the greatest
difference among women (Economic Policy Research
Institute, 2004). For young people who are structurally unemployed or at high social risk, the Joven programme in Chile combines work experience, training
and apprenticeships; this model has been replicated in
other South American countries (World Bank, 2003).
In other countries, such as India and Uganda, cash
transfers have been used to provide employment for
local youth and poor people. Cash transfers can also
provide critical resources for funding job search, supporting quality training and skills development, increasing access to credit and bolstering the resilience of
agricultural smallholders in maintaining production.
Public employment programmes can also be linked to
green jobs and environmental improvements, as for
example in Brazil and the Philippines. A recent study
from the United States indicates that giving food assistance to the children of poor families increases their
average annual earnings in the long run by as much as
US$3,000, and their average number of hours of work
by 150 annually (CBPP, 2014).
Many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America have developed ways of coordinating social protection mechanisms with labour market policies and
services, thereby strengthening opportunities for the

unemployed to return to the market. One particularly interesting finding is that adult participants in
a number of the Latin American cash transfer programmes mentioned above, as well as beneficiaries of
similar schemes in South Africa, were able to increase
their rate of economic activity, finding their employability boosted through simple investments in and
access to training and employment services, and to
look for work more effectively with the costs of job
searching boosted through the modest cash transfers
received by families.

Social protection promotes economic growth
Social protection schemes contribute to sustainable economic growth by raising labour productivity and empowering people to find decent jobs. Injecting money
into rural communities can have important multiplier effects on the local economy, stimulating trade
in goods and services and encouraging more dynamic
local development based on both agricultural and offfarm activities (Tirivayi, Knowles and Davis, 2013;
Alderman and Yemtsov, 2012). Social protection represents an investment in a country’s “human infrastructure” no less important than investments in its physical

infrastructure. Only a population that is healthy, well
nourished and well educated can realize its potential
for productive employment. The positive impacts of
cash transfers on children’s nutrition, and on access to
health and education, have been well recorded around
the world. Well-designed social protection systems thus
enable a country to unlock its full productive potential
and to promote inclusive growth (ILO, 2014d).
There are multiple channels through which social
protection systems can support such investments in
people (see ILO, 2010b; Social Protection Floor Advisory Group, 2011; Behrendt, 2013), with beneficial
effects in both the short and the longer term. In the
short term, social protection can help to improve the
health of the population, stabilize aggregate consumption, enable people to take more risky decisions and to
engage in more productive economic activities, preserve
and promote human capital and enhance the functioning of the labour market (see figure 6.23). It thereby
contributes to supporting structural changes in the
labour market and the economy, and also exercises its
much-needed counter-cyclical function in economic
downturns, such as that caused by the recent global
crisis.

contribute to the better physical and mental development of the population. The effects of enhancing access
to education and improving educational performance
also contribute to fostering a more productive and
more readily employable workforce, which is one of the
preconditions of sustained and inclusive growth (see
figure 6.24).
The crisis has triggered a shift in the way the international community sees the relationship between
growth, public intervention and social protection. In
Asia and the Pacific, for example, policy-makers are
increasingly moving away from export-led growth approaches alone towards more inclusive employmentintensive recovery strategies which emphasize the need
to reduce high domestic savings rates and improve the
region’s underdeveloped social protection programmes
(Ortiz and Cummins, 2013). China is a good example,
having massively expanded social protection schemes in
recent years to raise national living standards and promote national demand.
In Africa and elsewhere, the food price crisis highlighted the limitations of family- and community-based
traditional support systems in responding to aggregate
shocks and spurred efforts to strengthen local agriculture. At the global level, there is now an awareness
of the need to raise household incomes, expand internal

markets and prepare better for future shocks by building up stronger systems during the current crisis recovery period.

Social protection supports social peace,
political stability and state-building
Social protection is not only a human right; it is also
a social and political necessity. There can be no inclusive and cohesive society where the poor and rich drift
further and further apart. While the sources of political conflict vary from one country to another, conflict generally originates in severe social grievances,
often rooted in the perception of inequality among
social, ethnic, religious or other groups. Social protection measures have a central role to play in easing and
preventing such sources of conflict. Governments that
have introduced and maintained strong social security
systems have not only significantly reduced inequality,
but also earned the trust of their citizens by providing
them with reliable benefits and quality services, delivered by efficient and trustworthy institutions (e.g.
GIZ, 2012). Social protection thus plays a key role in
state building, institution building and fostering social
peace and social justice.

6.6.3 Leaving no one behind: Social protection
floors to change people’s lives by 2030
Social protection works. This is a key conclusion
from this World Social Protection Report. The extension of social protection in many developing countries in recent years has successfully realized the right
to social security for larger proportions of the population. More children and families receive cash benefits to enhance their income security, and these greatly
facilitate access to nutrition, health and education.
More older women and men can now rely on a regular
source of income from a pension, even if levels are still
modest. More people, especially those in rural areas,
are benefiting from having the right to guaranteed
employment for a certain number of days during lean
seasons, and thus enhanced income security round the
year. More children and adults have access to health
services because governments have extended health
insurance coverage and subsidized contributions for
those who would not be able to afford them otherwise, and have improved the quality and accessibility
of public health services. These significant investments
in social protection also enable workers to engage
in more productive employment, and strengthen

aggregate consumption. A social protection benefit
can make an enormous difference in the life of a single
person, and of an entire country.
Despite these positive efforts, 73 per cent of the
global working-age population, and their families, are
still not sufficiently covered in comprehensive social
security systems. More efforts are needed to accelerate the extension of social security to adequate levels.
Governments, with the participation of social partners
and other stakeholders, have a responsibility to fill the
remaining gaps in social protection and to progressively ensure adequate levels of social security for their
populations. Social protection floors address the daily
concerns of families and households, and are linked to
the realization of all people’s rights – those of children,
of women and men of working age, of persons with
disabilities, of older persons. Rio+20’s The Future We
Want recognized “the need to provide social protection
to all members of society, fostering growth, resilience,
social justice and cohesion” and encouraged “initiatives
aimed at providing social protection floors for all citizens” (UN, 2012a, p. 29). Looking beyond 2015, it
is essential that social protection floors and social security systems be included among the new ­Sustainable
Development Goals.

his glossary focuses on the basic concepts, defin­
itions and methodology guiding the analytical work
of the ILO on social security or social protection.1 It
does not set out to assert any universal definitions; its
purpose is rather simply to clarify terms and concepts as
they are used in this report and in the ILO.

Cash transfer programme. Non-contributory
scheme or programme providing cash benefits to individuals or households, usually financed out of taxation,
other government revenue, or external grants or loans.
Cash transfer programmes2 may or may not include a
means test.
Cash transfer programmes that provide cash to families subject to the condition that they fulfil specific
behavioural requirements are referred to as conditional
cash transfer programmes (CCTs). This may mean, for
example, that beneficiaries must ensure their children
attend school regularly, or that they utilize basic preventative nutrition and health-care services.
Contributory scheme.  Scheme in which contributions made by protected persons directly determine
entitlement to benefits (acquired rights). The most
common form of contributory social security schemes
is a statutory social insurance scheme, usually covering workers in formal wage employment and, in some

countries, the self-employed. Other common types of
contributory schemes, providing – in the absence of
social insurance – a certain level of protection include
national provident funds, which usually pay a lump sum
to beneficiaries when particular contingencies occur
(typically old age, invalidity or death). In the case of
social insurance schemes for those in waged or salaried
employment, contributions are usually paid by both
employees and employers (though in general, employment injury schemes are fully financed by employers).
Contributory schemes can be wholly financed through
contributions, but often are partly financed from taxation or other sources; this may be done through a subsidy to cover the deficit, or through a general subsidy
supplanting contributions altogether, or by subsidizing only specific groups of contributors or beneficiaries
(e.g. those not contributing because they are caring for
children, studying, in military service or unemployed,
or have too low a level of income to fully contribute, or
receive benefits below a certain threshold because of low
contributions in the past).
Employment guarantee scheme.  Public employment programme which provides a guaranteed number
of workdays a year to poor households, generally providing wages at a relatively low level (typically at the
minimum wage level if this is adequately defined).

1  The glossary largely draws on the definitions, concepts and methods provided in the first edition of the World Social Security Report (ILO,
2010a), with a number of important updates to reflect the provisions of the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), and
other recent developments.
2  Strictly speaking, this term would encompass all social transfers provided in cash, including fully or partially contributory transfers, yet it
is usually understood as limited to non-contributory transfers.

162

Means-tested scheme.  A scheme that provides benefits upon proof of need and targets certain categories of
persons or households whose means fall below a certain
threshold, often referred to as social assistance schemes.
A means test is used to assess whether the individual’s
or household’s own resources (income and/or assets)
are below a defined threshold and determine whether
the applicants are eligible for a benefit at all, and if so at
what level benefit will be provided. In some countries,
proxy means tests are used: that is, eligibility is determined without actually assessing income or assets, on
the basis of other household characteristics (proxies)
that are deemed more easily observable. Means-tested
schemes may also include entitlement conditions and
obligations, such as work requirements, participation
in health checkups or (for children) school attendance.
Some means-tested schemes also include other interventions that are delivered on top of the actual income
transfer itself.
Non-contributory schemes. Non-contributory
schemes, including non-means-tested and means-tested
schemes, normally require no direct contribution from
beneficiaries or their employers as a condition of en­
titlement to receive relevant benefits. The term covers
a broad range of schemes, including universal schemes
for all residents (such as a national health services), categorical schemes for certain broad groups of the population (e.g. for children below a certain age or older
persons above a certain age), and means-tested schemes
(such as social assistance schemes). Non-contributory
schemes are usually financed through taxes or other
state revenues, or, in certain cases, through external
grants or loans.
Public employment programme.  Government programme offering employment opportunities to certain categories of persons who are unable to find other
employment. Public employment programmes include
employment guarantee schemes and “cash for work”
and “food for work” programmes (see box 3.2).
Social assistance scheme/programme.  A scheme
that provides benefits to vulnerable groups of the
­population, especially households living in poverty.
Most social assistance schemes are means-tested.
Social insurance scheme.  Contributory social protection scheme that guarantees protection through
an insurance mechanism, based on: (1) the prior payment of contributions, i.e. before the occurrence of the

insured contingency; (2) risk- sharing or “pooling”; and
(3) the notion of a guarantee. The contributions paid
by (or for) insured persons are pooled together and the
resulting fund is used to cover the expenses incurred exclusively by those persons affected by the occurrence of
the relevant (clearly defined) contingency or contingencies. Contrary to commercial insurance, risk-pooling in
social insurance is based on the principle of solidarity as
opposed to individually calculated risk premiums.
Many contributory social security schemes are
presented and described as “insurance” schemes (usually “social insurance schemes”), despite being in actual
fact of mixed character, with some non-contributory
elements in entitlements to benefits; this allows for a
more equitable distribution of benefits, particularly for
those with low incomes and short or broken work car­
eers, among others. These non-contributory elements
take various forms, being financed either by other contributors (redistribution within the scheme) or by the
State.
Social protection.  The term “social protection” is
used in institutions across the world with a wider variety of meanings than “social security”. It is often interpreted as having a broader character than social
security (including, in particular, protection provided
between members of the family or members of a local
community), but it is also used in some contexts with
a narrower meaning (understood as comprising only
measures addressed to the poorest, most vulnerable or
excluded members of society). Thus, in many contexts
the two terms, “social security” and “social protection”,
may be largely interchangeable, and the ILO certainly
uses both in discourse with its constituents and in the
provision of relevant advice to them. In this report, reference is made to “social protection” both as an alternative expression for “social security” and to denote the
protection provided by social security in case of social
risks and needs.
Social protection floor.  ILO Recommendation
No. 202 sets out that member States should establish
and maintain national social protection floors as a nationally defined set of basic social security guarantees
which secure protection aimed at preventing or alleviating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion (ILO,
2012a). These guarantees should ensure at a minimum
that, over the life cycle, all in need have access to at least
essential health care and basic income security. These
together ensure effective access to essential goods and
services defined as necessary at the national level. More

Contents

Annex I. Glossary

specifically, national social protection floors should
comprise at least the following four social security guarantees, as defined at the national level:
(a)	 access to essential health care, including maternity care;
(b)	basic income security for children, providing
access to nutrition, education, care and any
other necessary goods and services;
(c)	 basic income security for persons in active age
who are unable to earn sufficient income, in
particular in cases of sickness, unemployment,
maternity and disability; and
(d)	 basic income security for older persons.3

Such guarantees should be provided to all residents and
all children, as defined in national laws and regulations,
and subject to existing international obligations.
Recommendation No. 202 also states that basic
social security guarantees should be established by law.
National laws and regulations should specify the range,
qualifying conditions and levels of the benefits giving
effect to these guarantees, and provide for effective and
accessible complaint and appeal procedures.
Social protection floors correspond in many ways
to the existing notion of “core obligations”, to ensure
the realization of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of rights embodied in human rights treaties
(OHCHR, 2013).
Social protection programme/scheme (social
­security programme/scheme).  Distinct framework
of rules to provide social protection benefits to entitled
beneficiaries. Such rules would specify the geographical
and personal scope of the programme (target group),
entitlement conditions, the type of benefits, benefit
amounts (cash transfers), periodicity and other benefit
characteristics, as well as the financing (contributions,
general taxation, other sources), governance and administration of the programme.
While “programme” may refer to a wide range of
programmes, the term “scheme” is usually used in a
more specific sense referring to a programme that is

anchored in national legislation and characterized by at
least a certain degree of “formality”.
A programme/scheme can be supported by one or
more social security institutions governing the provision of benefits and their financing. It should, in general, be possible to draw up a separate account of receipts
and expenditure for each social protection programme.
It is often the case that a social protection programme
provides protection against a single risk or need, and
covers a single specific group of beneficiaries. Typically,
however, one institution will administer more than one
benefit programme.
Social security.  The fundamental right to social
security is set out in the Universal Declaration on
Human Rights (1948) and other international legal instruments. The notion of social security adopted here
covers all measures providing benefits, whether in cash
or in kind, to secure protection, inter alia, from
•	 lack of work-related income (or insufficient income)
caused by sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment, old age, or death of a
family member;
•	 lack of (affordable) access to health care;
•	 insufficient family support, particularly for children
and adult dependants;
•	 general poverty and social exclusion.
Social security thus has two main (functional) dimensions, namely “income security” and “availability of
medical care”, reflected in the Declaration of Philadelphia (1944), which forms part of the ILO’s Constitution: “social security measures to provide a basic income
to all in need of such protection and comprehensive
medical care” (III(f)).4 Recommendation No. 202 sets
out that, at least, access to essential health care and
basic income security over the life cycle should be guaranteed as part of nationally defined social protection
floors, and that higher levels of protection should be
progressively achieved by national social security systems in line with Convention No. 102 and other ILO
instruments.

3  Recommendation No. 202, Para. 5.
4  These two main dimensions are also identified in the ILO Income Security Recommendation, 1944 (No. 67), and the Medical Care
Recommendation, 1944 (No. 69), respectively, as “essential element[s] of social security”. These Recommendations envisage that, first,
“income security schemes should relieve want and prevent destitution by restoring, up to a reasonable level, income which is lost by reason
of inability to work (including old age) or to obtain remunerative work or by reason of the death of a breadwinner” (Recommendation
No. 67, Guiding principles, Para. 1); and, second, that “a medical care service should meet the need of the individual for care by members of
the medical and allied professions” and “the medical care service should cover all members of the community” (Recommendation No. 69,
Paras 1 and 8). Recommendation No. 202 also reflects these two elements in the basic social protection guarantees that should form part of
national social protection floors (for more detail, see box 1.1).

Access to social security is essentially a public responsibility, and is typically provided through public institutions, financed from either contributions or taxes or
both. However, the delivery of social security can be and
often is mandated to private entities. Moreover, there
exist many privately run institutions (of an insurance,
self-help, community-based or mutual character) which
can partially assume selected roles usually played by social
security, such as the operation of occupational pension
schemes, that complement and may largely substitute for
elements of public social security schemes. Entitlements
to social security are conditional either on the payment
of social security contributions for prescribed periods
(contributory schemes, most often structured as social
insurance arrangements) or on a requirement, sometimes described as “residency plus”, under which benefits are provided to all residents of the country who also
meet certain other criteria (non-contributory schemes).
Such criteria may make benefit entitlements conditional
on age, health, labour market participation, income or
other determinants of social or economic status and/or
even conformity with certain behavioural requirements.
Two main features distinguish social security from
other social arrangements. First, benefits are provided
to beneficiaries without any simultaneous reciprocal obligation (thus it does not, for example, represent remuneration for work or other services delivered). Second,
it is not based on an individual agreement between the
protected person and the provider (as is, for example,
a life insurance contract); the agreement applies to a
wider group of people and so has a collective character.
Depending on the category of applicable conditions,
a distinction is also made between non-means-tested
schemes (where the conditions of benefit entitlement
are not related to the total level of income or wealth of
the beneficiary and her or his family) and means-tested
schemes (where entitlement is granted only to those
with income or wealth below a prescribed threshold).
A special category of “conditional” schemes includes
those which, in addition to other conditions, require
beneficiaries (and/or their relatives or families) to participate in prescribed public programmes (for example,
specified health or educational programmes).
Social security system/social protection system.
Totality of social security/protection schemes and programmes in a country, taking into account that the latter
term is often used in a broader sense than the former.
All the social security schemes and institutions in a
country are inevitably interlinked and complementary

in their objectives, functions and financing, and thus
form a national social security system. For reasons of
effectiveness and efficiency, it is essential that there is
close coordination within the system, and that – not
least for coordination and planning purposes – the
receipts and expenditure accounts of all the schemes
are compiled into one social security budget for the
country so that its future expenditure and financing of
the schemes comprising the social security system are
planned in an integrated way.
Social transfer.  All social security benefits comprise
transfers, either in cash or in kind: i.e. they represent
a transfer of income, goods or services (e.g. healthcare services). This transfer may be from the active to
the old, the healthy to the sick, or the affluent to the
poor, among others. The recipients of such transfers
may be in a position to receive them from a specific
social security scheme because they have contributed
to such a scheme (contributory scheme), or because
they are residents (universal schemes for all residents),
or because they fulfil specific age criteria (categorical
schemes), or specific resource conditions (social assistance schemes), or because they fulfil several of these
conditions at the same time. In addition, it is a requirement in some schemes (employment guarantee schemes,
public employment programmes) that beneficiaries accomplish specific tasks or (conditional cash transfer
programmes) adopt specific behaviours. In any given
country, several schemes of different types generally coexist and may provide benefits for similar contingencies
to different population groups.
Targeted scheme/programme. See social assistance
scheme.
Universal scheme/categorical scheme. Strictly
speaking, universal schemes provide benefits under the
single condition of residence. However, the term is also
often used to describe categorical schemes that provide
benefits to certain broad categories of the population
without a means-test. The most frequent forms of those
schemes are those that transfer income to older persons above a certain age or children below a certain age.
Some categorical schemes also target households with
specific structures (one-parent households, for example)
or occupational groups (such as rural workers). In some
schemes, entitlement to benefits may be conditional on
performing or accomplishing certain tasks. Most categorical schemes are tax-financed.

Measuring social
security coverage

Contents

M

easuring social security coverage is a complex task.
Several dimensions need to be considered in order
to arrive at a complete assessment. In practice, few
countries have available the full range of statistical data
necessary for a complete assessment of social security
coverage; nevertheless, partial information is available
for a large number of countries. Many countries have
acknowledged the need to undertake better regular
monitoring of social security coverage and are stepping
up their efforts to improve data collection and analysis.
Social security coverage is a multidimensional concept with at least three dimensions:
•	 Scope.  This is measured here by the range (number)
and type of social security areas (branches) to which
the population of the country has access. Population
groups with differing status in the labour market
may enjoy different scopes of coverage, and this
factor must be taken into account in assessing scope.
•	 Extent.  This usually refers to the percentage of persons covered within the whole population or the
target group (as defined by e.g. gender, age or labour
market status) by social security measures in each
specific area.
•	 Level.  This refers to the adequacy of coverage by a
specific branch of social security. It may be measured by the level of cash benefits provided, where
measurements of benefit levels can be either absolute or relative to selected benchmark values such as

previous incomes, average incomes, the poverty line,
and so on. Measures of quality are usually relative
and may be objective or subjective – for example,
the satisfaction of beneficiaries measured against
their expectations.
In measuring coverage, a distinction is made between
legal coverage1 and effective coverage in each of the
above three dimensions, and for each social security
area. Effective coverage is usually different from legal
coverage; it is often lower, largely due to various governance problems in implementing the legal provisions and
also to gaps in funding. Table AII.1 summarizes these
various dimensions of coverage.

Legal coverage
Estimates of the scope of legal coverage usually measure the number of social security areas (branches) by
which – according to existing national legislation – a
population or its specific groups is covered. The list of
the nine branches covered by ILO Convention No. 102
is used as guidance.
Estimates of the extent of legal coverage use both information on the groups covered by statutory schemes
for a given social security area (branch) in national
legislation, and available statistical information quantifying the number of persons concerned at the national

1  Legal coverage is sometimes referred to as “statutory coverage”, taking into account that provisions may be rooted in statutory provisions
other than laws.

level. A population group can be identified as legally
covered in a specific social security area (e.g. old age,
unemployment protection, maternity protection) if the
existing legislation sets out that this group is mandatorily covered by social insurance; or that this group will
be entitled to specified non-contributory benefits under
certain circumstances – for instance, to an old-age state
pension on reaching the age of 65, or to income support
if income falls below a specified threshold. A legal coverage ratio for a given branch of social security is the ratio
between the estimated number of people legally covered
and – as appropriate – the total population or labour
force in the relevant age bracket, the total number of
employees (that is, waged and salaried workers) or the
total number of employed persons (including employees
and the self-employed). For example, since Convention
No. 102 allows a ratifying country to provide coverage
through social insurance, through universal or meanstested benefits, or a combination of both, it also formulates alternatives to minimum requirements for the
extent of coverage, as follows: (a) prescribed classes of
employees, constituting not less than 50 per cent of all
employees; or (b) prescribed classes of the economically
active population, constituting not less than 20 per cent

of all residents; or (c) all residents whose means during
the contingency do not exceed prescribed limits.
The level of legal coverage for specific branches of
social security is usually measured (for cash benefits) by
benefit ratios or replacement ratios calculated for specified categories of beneficiaries, using benefit formulas
or benefit amounts specified in the legislation. For example, Convention No. 102 sets minimum replacement
rates for cash benefits in seven of its nine branches (see
tables in Annex III below). It specifies that such minimum rates should apply to a defined “standard” beneficiary meeting qualifying conditions, and be guaranteed
at least to those with earnings up to a certain prescribed
selected level.

Effective coverage
Measurements of effective coverage should reflect how
in reality the legal provisions are implemented. Effective
coverage is usually different from legal coverage (and
usually lower) because of non-compliance, problems
with enforcement of legal provisions or other deviations
of actual policies from the text of the legislation. In

Contents

Annex II. Measuring social security coverage

order to arrive at a full coverage assessment, measures of
legal and effective coverage need to be used in parallel.
Measurements of the scope of effective coverage in
a country reveal the number of social security areas
(branches) for which there is relevant legislation that is
actually enforced: that is, whether in all such areas the
majority of the population legally covered is also effectively covered (as measured by the extent of effective coverage; see below).
When measuring the extent of effective coverage a
distinction has to be made between coverage measured
in terms of protected persons and in terms of actual bene­
ficiaries. Protected persons are those who have benefits
guaranteed but are not necessarily currently receiving
them – for example, people who actively contribute to
social insurance and are thus guaranteed benefits for a
specified contingency, e.g. an old-age pension on reaching retirement age or people entitled to non-contributory benefits if needed.
In respect of protected persons, the contributor coverage ratio reflects, in the case of contributory schemes,
the number of those protected should they be affected
by the contingency covered now or in the future. That
is, the share of the employed population (or alternatively the population of working age or in the labour
force) which contributes directly or indirectly to social
insurance in a given social security area and is thus
likely to receive benefits when needed. An example is
the percentage of employed persons contributing to a
pension scheme. By extension, the protected person coverage ratio includes people entitled to non-contributory
benefits.
In respect of actual beneficiaries, the beneficiary
coverage ratio describes the proportion of the population affected by a certain contingency (e.g. older
persons, unemployed) who actually benefit from the
appropriate social security benefits (e.g. old-age pensions, unemployment benefits). This ratio reflects the
number of those actually receiving benefits, such as the
number of beneficiaries of any pension benefits among
all residents over the statutory pensionable age, or the
number of beneficiaries of some kind of income support among all those unemployed or all below the poverty line.
Measurements of the level of effective coverage would
identify the levels of benefits (usually related to certain

benchmark amounts) actually received by beneficiaries, such as unemployment benefits or pensions paid,
compared to average earnings or to the minimum wage
or the poverty line. In the case of contributory pension
schemes, the effective level of coverage may also relate to
future benefit levels.
When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage,
distinctions need to be made between coverage by
(1) contributory social insurance, (2) universal schemes
covering all residents (or all residents in a given category2), and (3) means-tested schemes potentially covering all those who pass the required test of income
and/or assets. In the case of social insurance it makes
sense to look at the numbers of those who are actually
members of and contributors to such schemes and who
thus potentially enjoy – sometimes with their dependants – coverage in the event of any of the contingencies covered by their social insurance. These people fall
into a category of persons “protected” in the event of
a given contingency. The concept of protected persons
may also apply where people are covered by universal or
categor­ical programmes: if there is legislation specifying that all residents, or all residents in a given (e.g. age)
category, are entitled to certain benefits or to free access
to social services, it can be said that all those specified
by law are “protected” in the event of the given contingency. It is, however, rather difficult to specify who is
in fact “potentially protected” in the case of income or
means-tested benefits or conditional cash transfers.
The above measures of extent and level of coverage are specifically applied to certain areas (branches)
of social security (and sometimes even only to specific
schemes or types of scheme), not to attempt to provide
a generic measure of social security coverage. Ensuring
the specificity of coverage indicators by area is essential
to arrive at a meaningful analysis and ensure its relevance for policy development.
As an aggregate measure of coverage, the report
uses the estimated proportion of the population enjoying comprehensive social security protection.3 Those
enjoying only a basic level of income security (income
security at the level of a nationally defined threshold,
such as the poverty line) at all stages of the life cycle
as well as access to essential health care (as nationally
defined) are considered to benefit from basic social
protection (the social protection floor, as defined in

2  Such schemes are also referred to as categorical schemes.
3  This estimate is based on the number of persons of working age who enjoy comprehensive social security coverage, i.e. are covered by law in
all eight areas (sickness, unemployment, old-age, employment injury, family responsibilities, maternity, invalidity, survivorship) in line with
Convention No. 102. Health is not included for methodological reasons.

Recommendation No. 202). Those benefiting from coverage (basic or comprehensive) in some of the areas are
considered to enjoy only partial basic or partial comprehensive coverage. The ultimate objective of all ILO
standards is to provide as many people as possible with
comprehensive protection; the intermediate objective
is to provide all people with at least a basic level of
protection.

Coverage in health

168

As regards coverage in health, dimensions similar
to those used for other branches apply; however, approaches and indicators need to be adjusted, particularly with regard to the provision of medical benefits in
kind. For example, the provision of quality medical care
requires considering the availability of skilled health
workers. Another difference from other branches relates to the fact that taking up health-care benefits
often requires private expenditure, even if affiliation to
a health system or scheme exists. Thus, implementing
social protection rights to health care requires ensuring
access to health care if needed and avoiding impoverishment arising from ill health.
Coverage in health has several dimensions:
•	 Legal health coverage: identification of the proportion of the population that is protected by legislation
or otherwise affiliated to a health system or scheme.
It is measured by one indicator, as explained below.
•	 Affordability, availability and financial protection of quality benefits: the scope of quality med­
ical benefits that is available, given e.g. the existence
of a sufficient number of skilled health workers that
can be accessed when in need without involving financial hardship or impoverishment. It is measured
by four proxy indicators, as explained below.
Against this background, assessing coverage in health
requires all dimensions to be taken into account simultaneously, using five proxy indicators. They should measure deficits regarding specific thresholds. Only when
data are considered from all five indicators ­together are
insights provided into the status quo and/or progress towards universal coverage in health.
The indicator for legal health coverage measures the share of a population (percentage of total
population) or its specific groups effectively affiliated
to or registered in a public or private health system
or scheme: mainly national health services, or social,

national, private or micro/community-based schemes.
It is usually measured as a deficit compared to 100 per
cent of the population in a given country and provides
information on the current status and progress of population coverage in terms of affiliation for each country
and region, and at the global level.
The indicators for affordability, availability and
financial protection of quality benefits are:
1.  Extent of out-of-pocket payments (OOP) as a percentage of total health expenditure: The direct outlays of
households, including gratuities and payments in kind,
made to health practitioners and suppliers of pharmaceuticals, therapeutic appliances and other goods and
services, whose primary intent is to contribute to the
restoration or to the enhancement of the health status
of individuals or population groups. It includes household payments to public services, non-profit institutions
and non-governmental organizations, and non-reimbursable cost-sharing, deductibles, co-payments and
fees-for-service, but excludes payments made by companies that deliver medical and paramedical benefits,
whether required by law or not, to their employees. It
excludes payments for overseas treatment.
2.  Coverage gap due to health professional staff deficit.
This indicator reflects both the supply side of access in
terms of availability of health care and the proportion
of the population not having access to health care due
to the absence of a sufficient health workforce.
The element first focuses on the availability of
human resources at a level that guarantees at least basic,
but universal, effective access for everybody. To estimate access to the services of skilled medical professionals (physicians and nursing and midwifery personnel),
it uses as a proxy the relative difference between the
density of health professionals in a given country and
its median value in countries with a low level of vulnerability (population access to services of medical professionals in countries with low vulnerability is thus used
as a threshold for other countries).
The relative ILO threshold corresponds to the
median value in the group of countries assessed as “low
vulnerability”. Countries have been classified in four
groups according to their level of vulnerability: very low,
low, high and very high vulnerability (see table AII.1).
The classification is based on three criteria: level of
poverty, extent of informal economy and fairness of
health-financing mechanisms. Proxies used are (1) the
incidence of poverty, based on the international poverty
line of income or consumption at or below US$2 PPP

a day; (2) non-waged employment as a proxy indicator
of informal employment; and (3) with regard to countries with low vulnerability, health expenditure not financed by OOP to a level above 40 per cent of total
health expenditure. The population-weighted median
number of skilled health workers (physicians and nursing and midwifery personnel) in countries considered
to be at low vulnerability serves as the threshold. Given
the socio-economic characteristics of these countries
and the health-financing mechanisms applied, these
countries are considered to be in a position to provide
universal access through a sufficient number of health
workers enjoying decent working conditions. In 2014,
the threshold stands at 41.1 physicians, nursing and
midwifery personnel per 10,000 population. Individual
countries’ deficits are calculated using this threshold
and the actual number of health workers.
Another way to look at the indicator is to refer to
population not covered due to a deficit from the supply
side. In this context, the ILO staff access deficit indicator estimates the dimension of the overall performance
of health-care delivery as a percentage of the population
that has no access to health care if needed.
3.  Financial deficit, calculated as per capita expenditure (except OOP) using the relative threshold of the
median expenditure in low vulnerability countries as
defined under (2) above. In 2014, the threshold stands
at US$239 per capita.
4. Maternal mortality ratio per 10,000 live births.

Further considerations
The main sources of this information are: country legislation; data on protected persons, beneficiaries, benefits
provided, costs and financing from the registers and
accounts of the institutions administering the various
social security schemes; and household survey data
from regular labour force surveys, household income
and expenditure surveys, household budget surveys or
surveys of similar type, or from surveys specially designed to monitor the coverage and impacts of social
security.
To summarize, a number of issues have to be taken
into account when measuring coverage:
•	 Social security coverage can be directly measured
only separately for each of the specific branches such
as health care, old age or unemployment, or even for
a group of specific schemes within each branch. Aggregate coverage measures such as the ADB Social
Protection Index can be built only by aggregating
the separate coverage indicators for all social security branches.
•	 Coverage by social security schemes against specific social risks and contingencies can be understood in two ways: potential coverage, measured by
the number of persons protected if a given contingency occurs (for example, those covered by social
insurance schemes, or contributors to such schemes),
and actual coverage, measured by the number of
beneficiaries actually receiving benefits or utilizing

Contents

169

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

services. These two concepts are complementary to
each other and should be assessed separately.
•	 Legal and effective coverage are distinct and must be
measured separately. Though people may be legally
covered, enforcement of the legal provisions may be
incomplete, so that effective coverage is usually lower
than legal coverage.

170

•	 In measuring the extent of coverage it is important
to choose the right numerator and denominator.
Ideally, the absolute number of persons covered for a
specific risk is divided by the size of the population
group targeted by the specific policy or benefit. For
example, to measure the extent of actual coverage by
old-age pensions, the number of pensioners should
be related to the total number of older persons,
where both numerator and denominator can be restricted to a given age bracket, such as those over 65
(or above any other statutory pensionable age).
•	 There is a trade-off between specificity of national
circumstances (and relevance of the indicator at the
national level regarding, for example, the retirement
age) and international comparability.
•	 Both administrative and survey data are necessary
to arrive at a full assessment of coverage. Administrative data are needed to assess potential and actual
effective coverage rates. However, the availability
and quality of such data vary across countries, and
across schemes within countries. Very often, administrative data trace certain administratively registered events (such as payment of contributions or
benefits) rather than the people behind such events.
This leads to double counting, in particular when
aggregating administrative data, as one individual
can be contributing to the same scheme from more
than one job, or to more than one scheme covering
the same contingency, or be receiving similar types
of benefit from more than one source.

•	 Household survey data are particularly important
in assessing the level and quality of coverage and
its impacts. Also, only household survey data can
help to assess the nature of coverage gaps, the characteristics of population groups not covered, and in
particular the consequences of their lack of coverage
and their need for specific types of coverage. Unfortunately, many regular household surveys still either
lack information relevant to assessing coverage, or
pose questions that are so various that international
comparisons are not possible. Special surveys, too,
are rare and also not internationally standardized.
This annex has presented a recommended approach to
measuring coverage. Unfortunately, as the data actually available are still limited, it has proved difficult to
follow the recommended approach fully in compiling
the present report. In consequence, the report is limited
to a detailed assessment of coverage in selected social
security areas, and does not fully measure all dimensions of coverage; moreover, data are available for too
few countries for an assessment of the level and quality
of coverage in most of the social security branches to be
made. This report therefore presents regional estimates
for selected indicators of coverage on the basis of available data. These regional estimates are calculated when
data availability ensures that countries included represent at least three quarters of the total population for a
given region. Regional averages are weighted, depending
on the indicator, by total population, the working-age
population, persons in the labour force or in employment. Owing to the limitations in data availability, most
of these regional estimates are calculated for the latest
available year, which is not necessarily the same for all
the countries included. While data availability has already improved since the first edition of this report, it is
hoped that further progress in improving national and
subnational statistics on social security will further enhance the accuracy of global and regional estimates.

ILO social security standards:

LO social security standards serve as key references,
guiding all ILO policy and technical advice in the
field of social security. They also give meaning and
definition to the content of the right to social security
as laid down in international human rights instruments
(notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
1948, and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, 1966), thereby constituting
essential tools for the realization of this right and the
effective implementation of a rights-based approach to
social protection.
The ILO’s normative social security framework consists of eight up-to-date Conventions and Recommendations. The most prominent of these are the Social
Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952
(No. 102), and the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202).1 Convention No. 102 is unique
among international standards in regrouping the nine
classical social security contingencies (medical care,
sickness, unemployment, old age, employment injury,
family responsibilities, maternity, invalidity, survivorship) into a single comprehensive and legally binding
instrument. It sets qualitative and quantitative benchmarks for each of these contingencies, which together
determine the minimum standards of social security
protection to be provided by social security schemes
with regard, inter alia, to:

•	
•	
•	
•	

definition of the contingency (what must be covered?)
persons protected (who must be covered?)
type and rate of benefits (what should be provided?)
entitlement conditions, including qualifying period
(what should a person do to get the right to a
benefit?)
•	 duration of benefit and waiting period (how long
must the benefit be paid/provided for?)

In addition, it establishes common rules of collective organization, financing and management, and lays down
principles for good governance, including the general
responsibility of the State for the due provision of benefits and proper administration of social security systems, participatory management, guarantee of defined
benefits, adjustment of pensions, right of appeal and
complaint, collective financing and risk-pooling, and
periodical actuarial valuations. Convention No. 102
continues to serve as a yardstick and reference in the
gradual development of comprehensive social security
coverage at the national level and as a means to prevent
the levelling down of social security systems worldwide,
as confirmed by the International Labour Conference
in 2011 (ILO, 2012a).
Tables AIII.1–AIII.9 below provide a summary
overview of some of the key requirements set out in
ILO standards.

1  Convention No. 102 has been ratified to date by 50 countries, most recently by Brazil (2009), Bulgaria (2008), Honduras (2012), Jordan
(2014), Romania (2009) and Uruguay (2010), and provides guidance for all 185 ILO member States. ILO Recommendations are not open
for ratification.

Myanmar enacted its social security law in 2012. The laws includes provisions for most social security branches including old age, survivors, disability, family benefits and unemployment insurance benefit (section 37), but
the country is at the stage of drafting the regulations and provisions are not yet being implemented.

	 Cuba. Family/child benefits: Dependants of young workers conscripted into military service are eligible for assistance from social security. Cash benefits are available for families whose head of household is unemployed due
to health, disability or other justifiable causes, and has insufficient income for food and medicine or basic household needs.
7
	 Dominica. Family/child benefits: Benefits are paid to unemployed single mothers with unmarried children younger than age 18 (age 21 if a full-time student, no limit if disabled) who lack sufficient resources to meet basic
needs. (Social assistance benefits are provided under the Old Age, Disability, and Survivors programme.)
8
	 Ecuador. Family/child benefits: No statutory benefits are provided. Mothers assessed as needy with at least one child (younger than age 18) and low-income families receive a monthly allowance under the Bono de
Desarrollo Humano programme.

The scope of coverage is measured by the number of social security policy areas (branches) provided for by law. This indicator can take the value 0 to 8 according to the total number of social security policy areas (or
branches) with a programme anchored in national legislation.
The eight following branches are taken into consideration: sickness, maternity, old age, survivors, invalidity, child/family allowances, employment injury and unemployment.
The number of branches covered by at least one programme provides an overview of the scope of legal social security provision.

Notes
n.a: Not applicable.
…: Not available.
a
	 Severance payment: in the national law (e.g. labour code) and directly paid by employers but no unemployment benefit programme anchored in national legislation.
b
	 Unemployed beneficiaries of general social assistance schemes are not included due to unavailability of data. Including them would increase coverage rates but only in countries where such schemes exist on a larger scale
(high-income and some middle-income countries).

be entitled to severance payment (as a lump-sum payment) on the basis usually of a minimum length
of service and/or the reason for the termination of the employment relation, sometimes depending on
professional categories, size of enterprise or other criteria. Severance payment is a lump sum. 31 countries
without unemployment benefit programme anchored in legislation provide such labour protection
(information available in the ILO Employment Protection Legislation database (EPLex) and in SSA and
ISSA, Social security programs throughout the world, Washington, DC and Geneva).

wages per year of service and is set according to the length of service.
4
	 Comoros: No programme anchored in legislation. Article 48 of the Labour Code (former art. 50): severance

and Employment (former Supreme Labour Council) and must take into account, in particular, worker’s
tenure and professional categories. No decree has been adopted as of October 2012.
5

the average daily pay of the last week of service for the first year of service.
7
	 Gabon. No programme anchored in legislation. Arts 70 and 73 LC: a worker is entitled to severance pay

8
	 Lesotho. No programme anchored in legislation. Art. 79 LC: A worker is entitled to severance pay
provided he has not been dismissed for misconduct and has completed more than one year of service.
Severance pay shall amount to two weeks’ wages for each year of service. However, the 1997 Labour Code

9
	 Libya: The 1980 Social Security Law requires employers to pay a severance benefit to laid-off employees
equal to 100 per cent of earnings for up to six months.
1

	 Morocco. No programme anchored in legislation. According to art. 53 LC, severance pay is due after 6 months
of service. It corresponds to a number of hours per year that varies according to the length of service.
11
	 Namibia. No programme anchored in legislation. An employer must pay severance pay to an employee
who has completed 12 months of continuous service (sec. 35 LA), if the employee is dismissed, dies while
employed or resigns after reaching the age of 65 years. The amount of severance pay must be equal to at
least one week’s remuneration for each year of continuous service with the employer (sec. 35 (3)).
12
	 Nigeria. The Pension Reform Act of 2004 provides enabling legislation for the National Social Insurance
Trust Fund to introduce a social insurance programme for unemployment benefits. No scheme has been
implemented to date. The Provident Fund Act of 1961 permits limited cash drawdown payments after one
year of unemployment for insured persons who contributed under the previous provident fund system.
13
	 Rwanda. No programme anchored in legislation. According to art. 35 LL, upon dismissal, workers are

14
	 Seychelles. Under the 1980 Unemployment Fund Act, the social security fund provides subsistence
income for unemployed persons. Data available refer to the unemployment relief scheme. National Bureau
of Statistics: Seychelles in figures, 2008 and 2012 (available at: http://www.nbs.gov.sc/wp-content/

that employer up to a maximum of ten years (art. 42(1) ELRA). An employer is required to pay severance
on termination of employment if the employee has completed 12 months of continuous service with an
employer and the employer terminates the employment (art. 42(2) ELRA).
16
	 Uganda. No programme anchored in legislation. The amount of severance pay is subject to negotiation
between the employer and the workers or the trade union that represents them (art. 89 EA). The law also
lists circumstances where severance pay is not due (i.e summary dismissal) (art. 88 EA). It seems that, in
the event of ordinary fair dismissal (including collective dismissals for economic reasons), the dismissed
employee is not entitled to severance pay.
17
	 Bangladesh. No programme anchored in legislation. The 2008 labour law requires employers to provide
a termination benefit, a retrenchment and lay-off benefit, and a benefit for discharge from service on the

permanent employees receive half the average basic wage for 120 days (plus a lump-sum payment of one
month’s salary for each year of service); casual workers for 60 days (plus a lump-sum payment of 14 days’
wages for each year of service); and temporary workers for 30 days.
18
	 Cambodia. No programme anchored in legislation. Art. 89 LC: if the worker is dismissed for a reason other
than serious misconduct, the employer must pay an indemnity for dismissal. The amount of the indemnity
depends upon the employee’s length of continuous service. This only applies to contracts of an unspecified
duration. Art. 73 LC provides that at the expiration of a fixed-term contract (the end of the term or completion
of the task), the employer must pay the employee severance pay which may be fixed by collective agreement
but should not in any case be less than 5% of the total wages paid during the length of the contract.

States (CIS) (available at: http://www.cisstat.com/0base/index-en.htm, accessed May 2014). From 2006:
the 2006 (labour code) regulates severance pay for employed persons. In the case of termination by
the employer, the employer pays one month of average monthly earnings (unless otherwise stated in the
employment contract).
20
	 India. Numerator: ILO Social security inquiry. “Unemployment allowance” was added in 2005 to the
existing Employees’ State Insurance Corporation scheme, which covers sickness and maternity, and covers
24% of all formal-sector workers, or 2% of the entire workforce. Does not include beneficiaries from the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The target group for this programme is broader than
unemployed.

	 Beneficiaries from the contributory pension can cumulate the basic benefits from the non-contributory

2
	 Malawi. In March 2011, a pension law established a mandatory old-age pension system based on
individual accounts for private-sector workers earning above a minimum salary threshold. The law has yet
to be implemented.
2
	 Seychelles. Social security fund: the Government contributes as an employer and guarantees the pension
benefits. Makes contributions out of the general budget. Seychelles pension fund: 1% of monthly earnings
for each insured person.
4
	 Sierra Leone. 2.5% of monthly income; 10% for civil servants and teachers; 12% for military and police
personnel.
5
	 Azerbaijan. 57 years old for a woman with three children or with a disabled child under 8.
6
	 China: (1) Basic pension insurance: Central and local governments provide subsidies as needed.
(2) Pension schemes for rural and non salaried urban residents:
– The basic pension of 55 yuan (CNY) (US$8.83 or PPP$35.17) per month is payable to older people
aged 60 and over whose children participate in the scheme – “family-binding” eligibility criteria.
– Mandatory individual account: Central and local governments provide subsidies as needed. Rural
residents who are aged 16 and over, not in education and not enrolled in an urban pension scheme are
eligible for an individual pension account. Participation is voluntary.
* Individual contributions range from CNY100 to CNY500 annually (equivalent to between US$1.28 and
US$6.24 per month). Local governments are to provide a partial matched contribution of at least CNY30
(US$4.81 or PPP$19.50) per year regardless of individual contribution.

Table B.6  Old-age pensions: Key features of main social security programmes

Notes

* Participants aged 45 and over are encouraged to contribute higher amounts to meet the shortfall in
contributions over their working lives.
* Pensioners who have contributed for 15 years will be eligible for a basic flat-rate pension calculated by
dividing accumulated contributions at 60 years by 139.
7
	 China. Estimates of legal coverage: legal coverage in rural areas: in June 2011, the Chinese Government
decided to accelerate the pace of extension to cover 60% of the rural areas by the end of 2011, and all rural
areas by the end of 2012. By law, 100% coverage is provided (on a voluntary basis) in rural areas.
The same applied to the voluntary non-salaried urban pension scheme. On 1 June 2011 the Chinese
Premier announced a new pilot pension insurance programme for non-employed urban residents, to be
implemented as of 1 July 2011. Modelled on the new type of rural pension scheme, it was expected to
cover 60% of China by the end of that year and to benefit all uninsured urban residents (around 50 million)
by the end of 2012, in parallel with the new voluntary Rural Pension Scheme. The scheme covers, by law,
all urban residents aged 16 and over (excluding school students) who are not engaged in employment and
hence do not qualify for enrolment under the basic pension scheme for urban employees. All such residents
can join the urban resident pension insurance programme on a voluntary basis at the place where their
households have been registered. Enrolled residents can elect one of the ten scales ranging from CNY100
to CNY1 000 as an annual contribution to their individual accounts, for which the Government will provide a
subsidy of no less than CNY30 to each person every year. The scales may differ in different regions.
8
	 China. Individual accounts (under contributory) also corresponds to legal coverage for the non-contributory
component of rural and urban non-salaried pension schemes.
9
	 Israel: Through a contribution of 0.25% of insured persons’ earnings (old-age and survivor pensions),
0.10% of insured persons’ earnings (disability benefits), and 0.02% of insured and self-employed persons’
earnings (long-term care), the Government subsidizes the following: 17.1% of total insured person and
employer contributions; the total cost of special old-age and survivor benefits and long-term care benefits
for new immigrants; and the total cost of social assistance income support programmes and the mobility
allowance.
10
	 Japan: The social insurance system consists of a flat-rate benefit under the national pension program (NP)
and an earnings-related benefit under the employees’ pension insurance program (EPI). Employers with
more than 1 000 employees may contract out a portion of the EPI if they provide more generous benefits.
11
	 Kuwait: Basic system: Government: 10% of covered earnings (public employees), 32.5% of payroll (military
personnel), and 25% of monthly income minus the self-employed person’s contributions (self-employed
persons).
12
	 Taiwan (China): National pension programme: 2.8% of the monthly minimum wage. For disabled and lowincome insured persons, 7%, 4.9% or 3.85% of the monthly minimum wage, depending on the degree of
disability or total family income. The monthly minimum wage is 18,780 Taiwan new dollars (TWD).
Labour insurance programme (social insurance): 0.75% of employee earnings (0.8% in 2013, gradually
rising to 1.2% by 2030); 3% of income for self-employed persons (3.2% in 2013, gradually rising to 4.8%
by 2030); the cost of administration. The maximum monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are
TWD$43,900. (The monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are adjusted according to changes in
the minimum wage.)
The Government’s contributions also finance cash sickness and maternity benefits.
Labour pension fund (individual account): None.
13
	 Thailand: A new voluntary social security system for informal sector workers was initiated in 2011. The
scheme is based on contributions from workers and Government to finance old-age, disability, survivors’,
sickness and maternity benefits.
14
	 Thailand: Formal-sector system: 1% of gross monthly earnings (old-age benefits).
The Government’s contributions also finance family benefits. Disability and survivor benefits are financed
under sickness and maternity.
The minimum monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are 1 650 baht (THB).
The maximum monthly earnings used to calculate contributions are THB15 000.
Informal-sector system: THB30 a month (sickness, disability, and survivor benefits) or THB50 a month
(old-age, sickness, disability, and survivor benefits).

27
	 Argentina: From 1994 until the end of 2008, there was a mixed system where all insured workers were
in the first-pillar public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system; for the second pillar, workers chose between
contributing to an individual account and to the PAYG defined benefit system. A 2008 law closed the
second-pillar individual accounts and transferred all workers and their account balances to the new onepillar PAYG system.
28
	 Bolivia: In 1997, all active members of the social insurance system transferred to a system of privately
managed mandatory individual accounts.
29
	 Costa Rica: The minimum monthly pension is 113,181 colones; if the calculated pension amount is lower,
a lump sum is paid.
30

3.55 pesos (depending on the salary range) for each day the insured contributes; for disability and survivor
benefits, 0.125% of covered earnings; finances the guaranteed minimum pension.
31
	 Peru: When public- and private-sector employees enter the workforce, they may choose between the
individual account system (SPP) and the public social insurance system (SNP). Insured persons who do
not make a choice become SPP members. SNP members may switch to the SPP but may not switch
back, except under certain circumstances.
32
	Uruguay: The mixed social insurance and individual account system is mandatory for employed and selfemployed persons born after 1 April 1956, with monthly earnings greater than 24,709 pesos (UYU) and
voluntary for those with monthly earnings of UYU24,709 or less. All others are covered only by the social
insurance system.
33
	Australia: Social security: the total cost from general revenue. Mandatory occupational pension
(superannuation): matches voluntary contributions by the insured, up to 1 000 Australian dollars (AUD) a
year for those with annual incomes up to AUD31 920 (co-contribution gradually decreases to 0 for annual
incomes between AUD31 920 and AUD61  920). Contributions are calculated based on after-tax income
and are not tax deductible.
34
	 Micronesia: Contribution from employer is 7.5% of twice the salary of the highest-paid employee per
quarter (January 2013).
26

World Social Protection Report 2014/15

pensioner care allowances and war veterans’ benefits.
Earnings-related pension: The total cost of covered study periods for students and unpaid periods of child
care for persons caring for a child younger than age 3.
17
	 Hungary: A 2010 amendment to the social security law terminated the diversion of contributions to
second-pillar individual accounts and automatically transferred account balances to the social insurance
programme (unless an account holder opted out). Since 2009, participation in the individual account
programme is voluntary.
18
	 Latvia: Municipalities provide social assistance benefits (means-tested and conditional) to the needy.
19
	 Norway: A new pension system introduced in 2011 replaces the universal pension with a guaranteed
minimum benefit and the earnings-related pension with an NDC scheme. The new system covers persons
born since 1963. Persons born before 1954 remain under the old system. A transitional (mixed) system, a
combination of the old and new systems, covers persons born between 1954 and 1962.
20
	Poland: The total cost of the guaranteed minimum pension; pays pension contributions for insured persons
taking child-care leave or receiving maternity allowances, for persons receiving unemployment benefits
and for unemployed graduates.
21
	 San Marino: A system of mandatory individual accounts was introduced in 2012 as a supplement to the
social insurance system. Both the insured person and the employer are required to contribute.
22
	 Slovakia: Since 1 April 2012, individual accounts are mandatory for new entrants to the labour force. They
may opt out of the system within two years.
23

…: not available

a

Year introduced: the first scheme that is the legal predecessor of any current scheme is indicated. Most schemes
have been reformed since and the current legislation is rarely that of the founding year.
Legal requirements: categories of criteria applicants have to fulfil, e.g. holding citizenship of the country in question,
having a legal residence, having income below a set level or passing an income test, having assets below a set level,
not receiving any other pension or receiving only a low pension. Other criteria includes all other legal requirements.
Geographical targeting means that the pension is available only in specific areas in the country. Non-working
means that the potential beneficiary cannot either be formally employed or practise any gainful activity. Not in state
institution means that elderly who are at home are excluded in the given country. It is also in this column that it is
indicated if the programme is comprehensive, offering other services such as elderly care or discounts in utilities
(the two most common). Special amount indicates whether there is a differentiated amount depending on civil status
or age or any other criterion.

China.  The indicator for China includes contributors to the new rural social
pension plan introduced nationwide in 2009. This new pension has two
components: a basic pension component financed by local and central
Government and a personal account component based on contributions
from enrolled individuals. In relatively poor regions the central Government
pays approximately 80% of the cost of the basic pension component and
the local Government bears the rest. The first basic pension component
justifies inclusion in this indicator, focusing on periodic cash benefits for
the elderly to ensure basic income security.

Notes
n.a.: Not applicable
…: Not available
Additional notes by country
Africa
Algeria.  Including old age ‘reversion pension’ but excluding anticipated
pension. Office national de la statistique (available at: http://www.ons.dz/
IMG/pdf/AQC_R_2011_ED_2012_-_Francais.pdf, accessed May 2014).
Burundi.  Includes old age, survivors pensions for people aged 60 and
over.
Cabo Verde. For the contributory pension provided by CNPS, the statutory
pensionable age is 65 and over for men and 60 and over for women. As
the non-contributory pension targets people aged 60 and over (either men
or women), the population of reference for the denominator has been set
at age 60.
Côte d’Ivoire.  Data from the CNPS (Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance
Sociale) and CGRAE (Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat).
Madagascar.  Data refer to the Caisse Nationale de la Prévoyance Sociale
(CNaPS) and two occupational schemes for civil servants: the Caisse
de Retraites Civiles et Militaires (CRCM), which covers civil servants,
government workers and the military; and the Caisse de Prévoyance et de
Retraites (CPR), which covers auxiliary agents employed by the Government,
who have not yet been granted full government employee status.
Malawi.  There is no national social insurance scheme in Malawi. The
Government Public Pension Scheme is a non-contributory, defined benefit,
PAYG system. There are around 600 private pension funds in Malawi not
included here.

Bangladesh.  The Government of Bangladesh provides its own employees
with a non-contributory, defined benefit pension with survivor benefits,
funded through tax revenues. Civil servants are eligible to receive a
pension at the age of 57.

Iran, Islamic Rep. of.  Corresponds to total number of insured as principal
contributors and refers to the social security organization and State
retirement fund.
Lebanon.  There is currently no income security for the elderly through
regular old-age pension benefits, only a lump sum.
Sri Lanka.  Number of contributors under the widows and orphans and
widowers and orphans pensions, 2003–09, which is in Sri Lanka the
only mandatory contributory scheme providing pensions, i.e. monthly
cash periodic benefits. This indicator refers to contributory mandatory
schemes providing pensions for people above statutory retirement age
(i.e. it excludes PSPS, which is a non-contributory scheme; EPF and ETF,
providing lump sums; and the three voluntary social security schemes,
Farmers’ Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, Fishermen’s
Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, and Social Pension and
Social Security Benefit Scheme (initially for self-employed only), which are
voluntary and provide either lump-sum or periodic benefits.
Tonga.  In September 2010, the National Retirement Benefits Scheme
(NRBS) Bill 2010 was passed by the Legislative Assembly, providing a
similar mandatory superannuation plan for the private sector and other
organizations. No statistics available yet (see: http://www.nrbf.to/, accessed
May 2014).
Vanuatu.  Active member refers to a person who has at least one
contribution paid on that member’s behalf for the current or any of the
preceding three months (see: http://www.vnpf.com.vu/p/vnpf-index.html,
accessed May 2014).
Latin America and the Caribbean
Uruguay.  According to household survey data, where the question is
put to employed persons, the proportions were lower in 2011 (52.6%
of people of working age and 67.6% of the labour force). See Insituto
Nacional de Estadística: Encuesta continua de hogares 2011 (available at:
http://www.ine.gub.uy/microdatos/microdatosnew2008.asp#ech, accessed

Table B.9  Old-age effective coverage: Old-age pension beneficiaries

Notes
Differences from proportions indicated in table B.7 may result from:
differences in reference years; differences in population of reference
between the non-contributory pension and the statutory pensionable age
considered here as the main criterion to define the population of reference
applied to all pensions.

Additional notes by country

China.  The indicator for China includes old-age pension recipients from
the new rural social pension plan introduced nationwide in 2009. This
new pension has two components: a basic pension component financed
by local and central Government, and a personal account component
based on contributions from enrolled individuals. In relatively poor regions
the central Government pays approximately 80% of the cost of the basic
pension component and the local Government bears the rest. The first
basic pension component justifies inclusion in this indicator, focusing on
periodic cash benefits for elderly to ensure basic income security.
Iran, Islamic Rep. of.  Refers to the social security organization and State
retirement fund.
Lebanon.  There is currently no income security for elderly through regular
old-age pension benefits, only a lump sum.
Malaysia.  Includes government pension scheme, which is the only one
providing cash periodic benefits, and a social assistance programme
targeting poor elderly with no family support.
New Zealand.  Percentage by sex estimated based on distribution from
2011.
Philippines.  The old-age grant, launched in 2011, and the retirement
programme for veterans, are considered non-contributory schemes.
Samoa.  The Samoa National Provident Fund provides the option for a
retirement pension or full withdrawal. Since the majority of SNPF members
take the option of full withdrawal, there were only 445 pensioners and
276 beneficiaries (i.e. 3.7% of persons age 55 and over) in 2011.
Sri Lanka.  This indicator refers to contributory mandatory schemes
providing pensions for people above statutory retirement age (i.e. it
excludes PSPS, which is a non-contributory schemes; EPF and ETF,
providing lump sums; and the three voluntary social security schemes,
Farmers’ Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, Fishermen’s
Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, and Social Pension and
Social Security Benefit Scheme (initially for self-employed only), which
are voluntary and provide either lump-sum or periodic benefits (available
at: http://www.statistics.gov.lk/abstract2010/Pages/index.htm, accessed
December 2013).
Thailand.  These proportions refer only to beneficiaries of the old-age
or disability social pensions. As a result the reference taken is not the
statutory pensionable age of 55 but the age of eligibility for the old-age
social pension (60 and over).
Tonga.  Only a minority of members opt for a regular pension once
reaching pensionable age. In September 2010, the National Retirement
Benefits Scheme (NRBS) Bill 2010 was passed by the Legislative
Assembly, Providing a similar mandatory superannuation plan for the
private sector and other organizations. No statistics available yet.

Africa

Vanuatu.  Mainly withdrawals.

Algeria.  Including old-age reversion pension but excluding anticipated
pension. Non-contributory pension (data for 2009): Evolution de la
catégorie des personnes âgées bénéficiaires de l’AFS (périodes: 20042009). Reference population: eligible age 60 years.

Europe

Angola.  Total number of pensioners. There is no general social assistance
programme aimed at the elderly.

Latin America and the Caribbean

Burundi.  Includes old age, survivors and ascendent pensions for people
aged 60 and over.
Cameroon.  Data for the public pension schemes are estimated based on
data available for previous years.
Cabo Verde.  Regarding the contributory pension provided by CNPS,
the statutory retirement age is 65 and over for men and 60 and over
for women. However, as the age of eligibility for the non-contributory
pension is 60 for both men and women, the reference population for the
denominator has been set at 60. Survey data (provided in this Statistical
Annex) provide lower numbers than administrative sources.
Congo.  Includes disability and survivors’ pensioners above statutory
pensionable age of 60.
Côte d’Ivoire.  Data from the CNPS (Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance
Sociale) and CGRAE (Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat).
Gabon.  The number refers to all pensions, resulting in a possible
overestimation of old-age pensioners.

Albania.  Includes old-age pensions including war veteran, special merit
and supplementary pensions. Ratio above statutory retirement age.
Brazil.  Age range used for the indicators: 65 and over for both men and
woment despite a statutory retirement age of 60 for women.
Colombia.  Age range used for the indicator: 65 and over.
Costa Rica.  The normal retirement age is 65 years with at least 300
months of contributions. Age 65 years is used as a basis to define the
reference population for this indicator.
Dominican Republic.  Age range used for the indicator: 65 and over.
Nicaragua.  The normal retirement age of 60 years is used as a basis to
define the reference population for this indicator.
Panama.  The normal retirement age of 62 (men) or 57 (women) is used as
a basis to define the reference population for this indicator.
Uruguay.  Proportion calculated for people aged 60 and over. For people
aged 65 and over, this proportion reaches 85.9%,
North America
United States.  Retirement (includes OASI), all beneficiaries aged 65 and

This indicator is calculated using the national health accounts estimates
available in: WHO (World Health Organization): National Health Accounts
(Global Health Expenditure database). Available at:
http://apps.who.int/nha/database [6 June 2014].
For further information on estimating out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures, see

Notes

Definitions
Out-of-pocket spending by private households (OOPs) is the direct outlay
of households, including gratuities and payments in kind, made to health
practitioners and suppliers of pharmaceuticals, therapeutic appliances
and other goods and services, whose primary intent is to contribute to

the restoration or to the enhancement of the health status of individuals
or population groups. It includes household payments to public services,
non-profit institutions and non-governmental organizations. It includes
non-reimbursable cost-sharing, deductibles, co-payments and fee-forservice, but excludes payments made by companies that deliver medical
and paramedical benefits, whether required by law or not, to their
employees. It excludes payments for overseas treatment.
Total (public and private) health-care expenditure not financed
by private households’ out-of-pocket payments
The effective level of financial protection provided to the population by
social health protection systems is measured here by a proxy indicator
expressed as a percentage of total (public and private) health-care
expenditure in the country not financed by private households through
out-of-pocket payments. The proxy is more or less equivalent to the
percentage of total (public and private) health-care expenditure in the
country financed either by general Government or by pre-paid private
insurance, by employers or NGOs.

Notes
n.a: Not applicable.
…: Not available.
	 Estimate of health coverage as a percentage of total population. Coverage includes affiliated members
of health insurance or estimation of the population having free access to health care services provided
by the State. Consult detailed data and sources available at: http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/
RessourceDownload.action?ressource.ressourceId=37218.
7
	 Out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure: see table B.10.
8
	 Percentage of the population not covered due to professional health staff deficit (based on 1. median value
in low vulnerability group of countries or 2. WHO benchmark).
The ILO staff access deficit indicator reflects the supply side of access availability – in this case the
availability of human resources at a level that guarantees at least basic, but universal, effective access to
everybody. To estimate access to the services of skilled medical professionals (physicians and nursing and
midwifery personnel), it uses as a proxy the relative difference between the density of health professionals
in a given country and its median value in countries with a low level of vulnerability (population access
to services of medical professionals in countries with low vulnerability is thus used as a benchmark for
other countries). The relative ILO benchmark corresponds to the median value in the group of countries
assessed as ‘low vulnerable’ (regarding the structure of employment and poverty). Based on 2011 data
from WHO (number of physicians, nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000), the estimated median
value is 41.1 per 10,000 poopulation when weighted by total population.
Another way to look at it is to refer to population not covered due to a deficit from the supply side (see
second part of example below). Then, the ILO staff access deficit indicator estimates the dimension of
the overall performance of health-care delivery as a percentage of the population that has no access to
health care if needed. This value is above the minimum set by WHO for primary care delivery, which is 23
per 10,000.
Professional staff includes physicians and nursing and midwifery personnel as defined by WHO. See
Indicator definitions and metadata (http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.
aspx?iid=3105, accessed May 2014).

	 WHO benchmark: It has been estimated, in the World Health Report 2006, that countries with fewer than
23 physicians, nurses and midwives per 10,000 population generally fail to achieve adequate coverage
rates for selected primary health-care interventions as prioritized by the Millennium Development Goals
framework (WHO Health Statistics 2012, pp. 82: http://www.who.int/gho/publications/world_health_
statistics/WHS2012_IndicatorCompendium.pdf, accessed May 2014).
10
	 Coverage gap due to financial resources deficit based on median value in low vulnerability group of
countries. The ILO financial deficit indicator follows the same principle as the access deficit indicator
regarding total health spending (in US$ per capita and per year) except out-of-pocket payments. The
relative median value in 2011 in group of countries assessed as ‘low vulnerable’ is estimated at 239 US$
per capita and per year.
11
	 According to the World Health Organization, ensuring access to the types of interventions and treatments
needed to address MDGs 4, 5 and 6 requires on average “little more than US$ 60 per capita [annually] by
2015”: WHO, The World Health Report: Health systems financing: The path to universal coverage, World
Health Organization (Geneva, 2010).
12
	 Aggregate measures are weighted by total population (2012) from United Nations Population Division, UN
World Population Prospects, 2012 Revision.

ocial protection policies play a critical role in realizing the
human right to social security for all, reducing poverty and inequality, and
promoting inclusive growth – by boosting human capital and productivity,
and by supporting domestic demand and structural transformation of
national economies. This ILO flagship report provides a global overview of
the organization of social protection systems, their coverage and benefits,
as well as public expenditures on social protection.
The report follows a life-cycle approach, starting with social protection
for children, followed by schemes for women and men in working age,
and closing with pensions and other support for older persons. It also
assesses progress towards universal coverage in health. The report
further analyses trends and recent policies, such as the negative impacts
of fiscal consolidation and adjustment measures, and urgently calls to
expand social protection for crisis recovery, inclusive development and
social justice.
The World Social Protection Report 2014/15 includes valuable and
comprehensive statistical annexes with the latest social protection data.
