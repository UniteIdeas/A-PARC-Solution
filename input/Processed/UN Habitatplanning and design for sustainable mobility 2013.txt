FOREWORD
For more than half a century, most countries have experienced rapid urban growth and increased use of
motor vehicles. This has led to urban sprawl and even higher demand for motorized travel with a range of
environmental, social and economic consequences.
Urban transport is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions and a cause of ill-health due to air
and noise pollution. The traffic congestion created by unsustainable transportation systems is responsible for
significant economic and productivity costs for commuters and goods transporters.
These challenges are most pronounced in developing country cities. It is here that approximately 90 per
cent of global population growth will occur in the coming decades. These cities are already struggling to
meet increasing demand for investment in transportation. That is why my Five-year Action Agenda, launched
in January 2012, highlights urban transport – with a focus on pollution and congestion – as a core area for
advancing sustainable development.
This year’s edition of the UN-Habitat Global Report on Human Settlements provides guidance on
developing sustainable urban transportation systems. The report outlines trends and conditions and reviews
a range of responses to urban transport challenges worldwide. The report also analyses the relationship between
urban form and mobility, and calls for a future with more compact and efficient cities. It highlights the role
of urban planning in developing sustainable cities where non-motorized travel and public transport are the
preferred modes of transport.
I commend this report to all involved in developing sustainable cities and urban transport systems. Success
in this area is essential for creating more equitable, healthy and productive urban living environments that
benefit both people and the planet.

INTRODUCTION
Urban transport systems worldwide are faced by a multitude of challenges. In most cities, the economic dimensions
of such challenges tend to receive most attention. The traffic gridlocks experienced on city roads and highways
have been the basis for the development of most urban transportation strategies and policies. The solution prescribed
in most of these has been to build more infrastructures for cars, with a limited number of cities improving public
transport systems in a sustainable manner.
However, the transportation sector is also responsible for a number of other challenges that do not necessarily
get solved by the construction of new infrastructure. It is, for example, responsible for a large proportion of the
greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change. Furthermore, road traffic accidents are among the main
causes of premature deaths in most countries and cities. Likewise, the health effects of noise and air pollution
caused by motorized vehicles are a major cause for concern. In some cities, the physical separation of residential
areas from places of employment, markets, schools and health services force many urban residents to spend increasing
amounts of time, and as much as a third (and sometimes even more) of their income, on public transport.
While those among the urban populace that have access to a private car, or can afford to make regular use
of public transport, see traffic jams and congestion as a major concern; this is a marginal issue for people living
in ‘transport poverty’. Their only affordable option for urban transportation is their own feet. Persons with low
household incomes – but also others, including many women, and vulnerable groups such as the young, the elderly,
the disabled, and ethnic and other minorities – form the bulk of those characterized as living in transport
poverty.
Thus, when the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched his ‘5-year action agenda’ in January
2012, he identified sustainable transportation as one of the major building blocks of sustainable development. In
particular, he stressed the need for urgent action to develop more sustainable urban ‘transport systems
that can address rising congestion and pollution’. He noted that action was required by a range of actors,
including ‘aviation, marine, ferry, rail, road and urban public transport providers, along with Governments and
investors’.
Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility: Global Report on Human Settlements 2013
seeks to highlight the transportation challenges experienced in cities all over the world, and identifies examples
of good practice from specific cities of how to address such challenges. The report also provides recommendations
on how national, provincial and local governments and other stakeholders can develop more sustainable urban
futures through improved planning and design of urban transport systems.
The report argues that the development of sustainable urban transport systems requires a conceptual leap.
The purpose of ‘transportation’ and ‘mobility’ is to gain access to destinations, activities, services and goods. Thus,
access is the ultimate objective of all transportation (save a small portion of recreational mobility). The construction
of more roads for low-income cities and countries is paramount to create the conditions to design effective transport
solutions. However, urban planning and design for these cities and others in the medium and high income brackets
is crucial to reduce distances and increase accessibility to enhancing sustainable urban transport solutions. If city
residents can achieve access without having to travel at all (for instance through telecommuting), through more
efficient travel (online shopping or car-sharing), or by travelling shorter distances, this will contribute to reducing
some of the challenges currently posed by urban transport. Thus, urban planning and design should focus on how
to bring people and places together, by creating cities that focus on accessibility, rather than simply increasing the
length of urban transport infrastructure or increasing the movement of people or goods.
The issue of urban form and functionality of the city is therefore a major focus of this report. Not only should
urban planning focus on increased population densities; cities should also encourage the development of mixeduse areas. This implies a shift away from strict zoning regulations that have led to a physical separation of activities
and functions, and thus an increased need for travel. Instead, cities should be built around the concept of ‘streets’,

viii

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

which can serve as the focus for building liveable communities. Cities should therefore encourage mixed landuse, both in terms of functions (i.e. residential, commercial, manufacturing, service functions and recreational)
and in terms of social composition (i.e. with neighbourhoods containing a mixture of different income and social
groups).
Such developments also have the potential to make better use of existing transport infrastructure. Most of
today’s cities have been built as ‘zoned’ cities, which tends to make rather inefficient use of their infrastructure;
as ‘everyone’ is travelling in the same direction at the same time. In such cities, each morning is characterized by
(often severe) traffic jams on roads and congestion on public transport services leading from residential areas to
places of work. At the same time, however, the roads, buses and trains going in the opposite direction are empty.
In the afternoon the situation is the opposite. Thus, the infrastructure in such cities is operating at half capacity
only, despite congestion. In contrast, in cities characterized by ‘mixed land-use’ (such as Stockholm, Sweden),
traffic flows are multidirectional – thus making more efficient use of the infrastructure – as residential areas and
places of work are more evenly distributed across the urban landscape.
Furthermore, the report argues with strong empirical information that increased sustainability of urban passenger
transport systems can be achieved through modal shifts – by increasing the modal share of public transport and
non-motorized transport modes (walking and bicycling), and by reducing private motorized transport. Again, an
enhanced focus on urban planning and design is required, to ensure that cities are built to encourage environmentally
sustainable transportation modes. While encouraging a shift to non-motorized transport modes, however, the report
acknowledges that such modes are best suited for local travel and that motorized transport (in particular public
transport) has an important role while travelling longer distances. However, in many (if not most) countries there
is a considerable stigma against public transport. The private car is often seen as the most desirable travel option.
There is thus a need to enhance the acceptability of public transport systems. More needs to be done to increase
reliability and efficiency of public transport services and to make these services more secure and safe.
The report also notes that most trips involve a combination of several modes of transport. Thus, modal integration
is stressed as a major component of any urban mobility strategy. For example, the construction of a high-capacity
public transport system needs to be integrated with other forms of public transport, as well as with other modes.
Such integration with various ‘feeder services’ is crucial to ensure that metros, light rail and bus rapid transit (BRT)
systems can fully utilize their potential as a ‘high-capacity’ public transport modes. It is therefore essential that
planners take into account how users (or goods) travel the ‘last (or first) mile’ of any trip. By way of an example,
it is not much use to live ‘within walking distance’ of a metro (or BRT) station, if this implies crossing a busy eightlane highway without a pedestrian crossing, or if one is unable to walk to the station (due to disability, or lack of
personal security). Likewise, it is unlikely that urban residents will make use of metros (and BRTs), if the nearest
station is located beyond walking distance, and there is no public transport ‘feeder’ services providing access to
these stations or no secure parking options for private vehicles near the stations.
Yet, it is important to note that considerable investments are still required in urban transportation infrastructure
in most cities, and particularly in developing countries. City authorities should ensure that such investments are
made where they are most needed. They should also make sure that they are commensurate with their financial,
institutional and technical capacities. In many cities of developing countries, large proportions of the population
cannot afford to pay the fare required to use public transport, or to buy a bicycle. Others may find these modes
of transport affordable, but choose not to use them as they find the safety and security of public transport to be
inadequate (due to sexual harassment or other forms of criminal behaviour), and/or the roads to be unsafe for
bicycle use or walking (due to lack of appropriate infrastructure). Investment in infrastructure for non-motorized
transport or affordable (and acceptable) public transport systems is a more equitable (and sustainable) use of scarce
funds.
However, many cities and metropolitan areas, all around the world, experience considerable institutional,
regulatory and governance problems when trying to address urban mobility challenges. In many cases national,
regional and local institutions may be missing or their responsibilities may be overlapping, and even in conflict
with each other. To address such concerns, the report notes that it is essential that all stakeholders in urban
transport – including all levels of government, transport providers and operators, the private sector, and civil
society (including transport users) – are engaged in the governance and development of urban mobility
systems.
To ensure effective integration of transportation and urban development policies, it is essential that urban
transportation and land-use policies are fully integrated. Such integration is required at all geographic scales. At
the micro level, much is to be gained from advancing the model of ‘complete streets’; an acknowledgement that
streets serve numerous purposes, not just moving cars and trucks. At the macro level, there is considerable scope
for cross-subsidies between different parts of the urban mobility system, including through value-capture
mechanisms which ensure that increased land and property values (generated by the development of high-capacity
public transport systems) benefits the city at large, and the wider metropolitan region, rather than private sector
actors alone.
Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility: Global Report on Human Settlements 2013 is
released at a time when the challenges of urban transportation demands are greater than ever. This is particularly

the case in developing countries where populations (and the number of motorized vehicles) are growing at rates
where urban infrastructure investments are unable to keep pace. I believe this report will serve as a starting point
to guide local authorities and other stakeholders to address the challenges faced by urban transportation systems
all over the world. The report provides some thought-provoking insights on how to build the cities of the future
in such a manner that the ultimate goal of urban transport – namely enhanced access to destinations, activities,
services and goods – takes precedence over ever-increasing calls for increased urban mobility.

CHAPTER

1

THE URBAN MOBILITY
CHALLENGE
Hyper-mobility – the notion that more travel at faster
speeds covering longer distances generates greater
economic prosperity – seems to be a distinguishing
feature of urban areas, where more than half of
the world’s population currently reside. By 2005,
approximately 7.5 billion trips were made each day
in cities worldwide.1 In 2050, there may be three to
four times as many passenger-kilometres travelled as
in the year 2000, infrastructure and energy prices
permitting.2 Freight movement could also rise more
than threefold during the same period.3 Mobility
flows have become a key dynamic of urbanization,
with the associated infrastructure invariably constituting the backbone of urban form. Yet, despite the
increasing level of urban mobility worldwide, access
to places, activities and services has become increasingly difficult. Not only is it less convenient –
in terms of time, cost and comfort – to access locations in cities, but the very process of moving around
in cities generates a number of negative externalities.
Accordingly, many of the world’s cities face an unprecedented accessibility crisis, and are characterized
by unsustainable mobility systems.
This report examines the state of urban mobility
in different parts of the world. It explores the linkages
between urban form and mobility systems, with a view
to determining the essential conditions for promoting
the sustainable movement of people and goods in
urban settings. This introductory chapter reviews key
issues and concerns of urban mobility and provides
a framework for the content of the rest of the report.
It outlines development trends impacting on urban
mobility and then discusses urban mobility issues of
the twenty-first century, including the challenges of
fostering sustainable mobility.
Current urbanization patterns are causing unprecedented challenges to urban mobility systems,
particularly in developing countries. While these
areas accounted for less than 40 per cent of the global
population growth in the early 1970s, this share has
now increased to 86 per cent, and is projected to
increase to more than 100 per cent within the next

15 years, as the world’s rural population starts to
contract. What is perhaps even more striking is the
regional patterns of urban population growth. Figure
1.1 shows how an increasing share of this growth is
projected to occur in Africa (19 per cent of total
annual growth today, compared to 43 per cent in
2045), while the combined annual urban population increase in developed countries, China, Latin
America and the Caribbean is projected to decrease
from 46 per cent of the total today to 11 per cent
in 2045. Thus, it is the world’s poorest regions that
will experience the greatest urban population
increase. These are the regions that will face the
greatest challenges in terms of coping with increasing
demands for improved transport infrastructure. In
fact, projections indicate that Africa will account for
less than 5 per cent of the global investments in transport infrastructure during the next few decades (see
Table 8.2).
A major point of departure for this report is that
sustainable mobility extends beyond technicalities
of increasing speed and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of transport systems, to include
demand-oriented measures (e.g. promoting walking
and cycling, and reducing the need to travel), with
the latter representing a pivotal factor in achieving
relevant progress. It suggests that the prevailing
challenges of urban mobility are consequences of the
preoccupation with the means of mobility rather than
its end – which is the realization of accessibility.
This first chapter of the report starts with a
discussion of the need to focus on access as the basis
for urban mobility planning. It urges urban planners
and decision-makers to move away from a ‘transport
bias’ in urban mobility planning, towards a focus on
the human right to equitable access to opportunities.
This is followed by a brief analysis of global conditions and trends with respect to the urban movement
of people and goods. The last part of the chapter
provides a brief discussion of the social, environmental, economic and institutional dimensions of sustainability in urban mobility systems.

ACCESSIBILITY IS AT
THE CORE OF URBAN
MOBILITY
In directing attention beyond transport and mobility,
and giving prominence to the aspect of accessibility, this report calls for a paradigm shift in transport policy. This alternative approach emphasizes the
need to reduce the global preoccupation on mobility
enhancement and infrastructure expansion. ‘This
kind of transportation planning has been implicated
in problems of environmental degradation and social
isolation.’ However, ‘most fundamentally, a focus on
mobility as a transportation-policy goal neglects the
consensus view that the vast majority of trips are not
taken for the sake of movement per se, but in order
to reach destinations, or more broadly, to meet
needs.’4
While the speed and efficiency of travel are
important, more critical however, is the ease of
reaching those destinations in terms of proximity,
convenience as well as positive externalities. Transport and mobility as derived demands are treated as
means for enabling people to access other people and
places. Reducing the need for such demands and
minimizing travel time also entails optimizing the
value of being at the destination. ‘Mobility is thus
properly viewed as a means to the greater end of
accessibility.’ Nonetheless, it is not the only means
to this end: ‘accessibility can be enhanced through
proximity’, as well as ‘electronic connectivity’.5 As a
result, enhancing accessibility places human and
spatial dimensions at the core of sustainable mobility.
This focus on accessibility emphasizes the need

for a holistic and integrated approach to sustainable
urban mobility. It establishes a link between urban
form (in terms of shape, structure, function as well
as demographics) and urban transportation systems.
Particular attention is given to the urban form’s
potential to support the increased proximity of places
and functions, thus minimizing the need for extended
movement. Land-use planning ensures the proximity
and compactness of locations, and diversifies functions, so as to cater to a variety of needs.
The accessibility focus for sustainable mobility
also entails paying due consideration to the built form
of the city, particularly the optimization of urban
density and the fostering of a sense of place. The
combination of high-density settlements, strong sense
of place and mixed-used functions not only minimize
the need for extended movement, but also enhance
economies of agglomeration and encourage nonmotorized mobility. Furthermore, appropriate design
and layout of streets and neighbourhoods, proper
allowance for building configuration and density,
and streamlined arrangement of arterial streets
and roads, should also be taken into account. The
backbone of accessibility-based urban mobility is
public transport, particularly high-capacity public
transport systems that are well integrated in a multinodal arrangement.
The bottom line for accessibility is not the
hardware; rather it is the quality and efficiency of
reaching destinations whose distances are reduced.
Equally important is the affordability and inclusiveness in using the provided facilities. Sustainable
mobility is thus determined by the degree to which
the city as a whole is accessible to all its residents,
including low-income earners, the elderly, the

young, the disabled, as well as women with children.
Furthermore, transport interventions should be
explicitly targeted to prevent negative outcomes. By
permitting high levels of innovative services and
giving priority to public and non-motorized transport,
the need for private cars is reduced. Strategies to
change public attitudes and encourage sustainable
forms of mobility thus have a key role to play.
This alternative approach also brings to the fore
the human rights dimension of sustainable mobility:
‘the right to mobility is universal to all human beings,
and is essential for the effective practical realisation
of most other basic human rights’.6 Beyond the policy
implications of such a profound acknowledgement,
the observation also has an important bearing on this
report. Recognizing mobility as an entitlement – i.e.
to access destinations, functions or services – implies
a focus on people, and underscores the need to pay
attention to the obstacles that prevent them from
reaching destinations. Consequently, mobility is
not only a matter of developing transport infrastructure and services, but also of overcoming the
social, economic, political and physical constraints
to movement. These constraints are influenced by
factors such as: class, gender relations, poverty,
physical disabilities, affordability, etc. Mobility is
thus about granting access to opportunities and empowering people to fully exercise their human rights.
Thus, associating sustainable mobility with
human rights takes it beyond the realm of functionality and economic justification. Instead it places
the issue at the same level as other essential elements
required for the full realization of human rights.
Indeed, there is a general consensus that all the
political, social, cultural and economic rights cannot
be realized without the component of accessibility
(and thus equitable mobility). The underlying premise
– within a human rights perspective – is that mobility
is not simply about reaching destinations; in the final
analysis, it is about accessing opportunities. In this
regard – and acknowledging that access is a tacit right
that all human beings are entitled to – there is a need
to ensure that any constraints to enjoying this fundamental entitlement are removed.
This report illustrates the contextual circumstances of urban mobility challenges, which have
restricted access to cities by various social groups.
Working towards sustainable mobility, renewed
efforts within and between governments, are
essential in ensuring that solutions are inclusive,
participatory, and that all budgetary and resource
implications meet the needs of all citizens.

THE TRANSPORT BIAS
OF MOBILITY
In many cities of the world, the equation of ‘mobility’ with ‘transportation’ has fostered a tendency

towards increasing motorization, and a propensity
to expand the network of urban roads. Highway
structures, including viaducts and flyovers, tunnels
and foot-bridges have become standard features of
the modern city and urban landscape. Encouraging
this whole process is the excessive sectorization of
transportation planning and management. Apart from
causing a spiral of negative externalities, this approach
further distorts the urban form and severely
undermines the environmental, social and economic
sustainability of cities. A major missing link which
this report underscores is that sustainable mobility
entails – and indeed requires – a closer connection
between transport and land-use planning.
Globally, the transport bias of urban mobility is
demonstrated by the dominance of motorization, and
particularly private motor vehicles as the preferred
means of mobility. In 2010, there were more than
1 billion motor vehicles worldwide (excluding twowheelers).7 Based on data from 2005, nearly half of
all urban trips were made by private motorized
modes, a figure that continues to climb.8 By 2010,
developed countries had, on average, ten times as
many motor vehicles (excluding two-wheelers) per
capita as developing ones.9
Meteoric increases in the number of motor
vehicles in developing countries mean that a
redistribution of the ‘global travel pie’ is unfolding.
By 2035, the number of light-duty motor vehicles –
cars, sports utility vehicles (SUVs), light trucks and
mini-vans – is projected to reach nearly 1.6 billion
(Figure 1.2). The majority of these will be found in
developing countries, especially China, India and
other Asian countries. China alone is projected to
have approximately 350 million private cars by 2035,
nearly ten times as many as they had in 2008.10 In
some rapidly emerging economies such as India, the
number of cars, trucks, and motorized two-wheelers
on city streets is growing at a rate of more than 20
per cent annually.11 Mexico City’s car population is
increasing faster than its human population – two
new cars enter into circulation every time a child is
born.12 In India, private vehicle growth exceeds
population gains by a factor of three.13
The extent of global motorization is a major
cause for the increasing trends in energy use and
carbon emissions worldwide. This has fuelled lowdensity development and sprawling urban forms,
which have gradually increased the dependence on
motorized transport. Furthermore, government
policies in the United States (US) have contributed
towards shaping car-dependent settlement patterns.
Following the Second World War, the US government invested heavily in high-capacity highways
and freeways and subsidized home mortgages, while
most of its European counterparts channelled
funds into development of urban rail systems, and
social and market-rate housing near public transport
stops.14

However, global motorization explains only part
of the increasing energy use and greenhouse gas
emissions worldwide. Other contributing factors
relate to economic growth and rising incomes,
especially in developing countries. From 2002 to
2007, China’s per capita incomes almost doubled,
and car ownership nearly tripled.15 Car dependency
is also served by a cultural and commercial system,
which promotes the car as a symbol of status and
personal freedom. Therefore, many developing
countries perceive motorization as a condition for
development. Conversely, evidence from an analysis
of the relationship between car use and gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita levels between
1970 and 2008 in eight developed countries shows
that travel distances by cars may have peaked and
that further increases in GDP per capita are unlikely
to lead to increased travel distances.16 Another recent
study found that the annual increase in car use per
capita in developed countries fell from 4.2 per cent
in the 1960s, to 2.3 per cent in the 1990s, to 0.5
per cent from 2000 to 2010.17 Saturation occurs
partly because the amount of additional wealth
that people choose to spend on travel is reduced
when incomes reach a certain point.18 In the US,
for instance, households earning US$50,000 per
year averaged more kilometres of vehicle travel in
2009 than households with twice as much annual
income.19 Moreover, factors such as shrinking
city sizes and lifestyle changes are contributing to
levelling off of car ownership and usage in developed
countries. Furthermore, increasingly ageing populations further contribute to the stabilization of motorization rates.20
In many transitional countries, the shift to
capitalist economies has been accompanied by an
explosive growth in the number of freight vehicles,
particularly trucks. From 1993 to 2009, truck traffic
grew by 165 per cent in Poland, 213 per cent in
Croatia, and 247 per cent in the Czech Republic.21
Many trucks are old and are kept running for
longer than the manufacturer’s estimated lifetime,

2035

aggravating energy requirements, local environmental problems and carbon emissions. In Asia’s
rapidly industrializing cities, globalization and
consumerism have given rise to a wide variety of
freight-carrying modes – trucks, pickup vans, trailers,
ropeways and railways that coexist with nonmotorized modes such as cycle rickshaws, animalpowered carts and head-loading. For every truck in
Delhi, India, there are about five feeder informal
motorized goods vehicles, five non-motorized vehicles
and five to ten head-loaders.22
Another feature of the transport bias has been
heavy investments in infrastructure. In China, for
example, the total length of urban roads more than
doubled in the 13-year period between 1990 and
2003.23 During the same period, the total area
allocated to roads more than tripled.24 Similarly, in
Nairobi, Kenya, a total of 143 kilometres of urban
roads was either newly constructed or rehabilitated
for a total cost of US$537.8 million between
2008 and 2012.25 This is a substantial amount for a
young African economy, and was invested mainly to
increase traffic flows and to enable faster mobility.
In European countries, road infrastructure accounted
for more than two-thirds of infrastructure investments in the transport sector between 1995 and
2010 (Figure 1.3).
The global expansion of mobility encompasses
great innovations that have linked transportation
with intelligent communication systems, transforming
the way in which people organize their travel and
communication considerably. The interplay of these
systems has redefined the core of social interaction
and urban life.26 Accordingly, the evolving transport system of the last century is firmly rooted in a
number of key components including motorized
modes, oil industry, consumerist lifestyles, global
procurement of oil, spatial and infrastructure planning, urban and street design and societal values
that embrace mobility as part of what constitutes high
quality of life standards.27

SOME OF THE FORCES
PROMOTING THE
TRANSPORT BIAS
The rapid motorization of many of the world’s cities
is further compounded by expanding globalization, rising trade flows and incomes, leading to an
enhanced demand for personal mobility. In many
parts of the world, and particularly in developing
countries, the private car has become a status symbol, depicting affluence and success in life. A prime
example is the largely unregulated large-scale importation of used vehicles to developing countries. Evidence suggests that over 80 per cent of
the vehicle stock in Peru was originally imported as
used vehicles from the US or Japan.28 Similarly, in
many African countries, import-liberalization policies
introduced during the 1990s made it easier and
cheaper for households to buy second-hand vehicles
imported from overseas.
A number of influential converging factors – such
as economic policies that maintain fuel subsidies
and planning practices that incentivize suburban
residential developments, large malls and retail
centres with extensive parking – all play a role in
increasing motorization. The suburban development
that supported the car culture allowed people to live
in low-density residential areas that, although
requiring a longer commute, were cheaper in terms
of land prices. Some examples include the rise of
new ‘urban villages’ such as Mahindra World City in
Chennai (India), Gurgaon satellite town near Delhi
(India) and Tlajomulco in the urban agglomeration
of Guadalajara (Mexico). Similarly, in Metro Manila,
the Philippines, new settlements described as
‘exurbia’ have emerged during the last two decades,
including Bulacan, Pampanga, Rizal, Quezon, Cavite,

Laguna and Batangas, all of which have been converted into gated communities and sustained by
dependence on car-based transportation.29 It should
also be mentioned that between 1970 and 1990, Los
Angeles, US, sprawled an additional 1020 square kilometres, during which time the population increased
by 3.1 million residents.30
Such planning choices ensured that the car
became an essential part of most people’s transportation needs. In many instances, governments at
all levels have also accelerated sprawl by building
more roads to the urban fringe. For example, despite
having only 10 per cent more freeway kilometres,
Chicago has more than twice as many residents as
Houston. The increasing trend to build more roads
in Houston has encouraged development to shift to
newer areas, with minimal bus service. This has
reinforced the vicious circle of car dependency,
where the new roads develop their own congestion
problems. In 1999 alone, Houstonians lost 36 hours
per person as a result of traffic congestion, more than
commuters in all but three other American cities
(Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas).31
The fragmentation and sectoralization of the
management of urban development in many parts
of the world is also reinforcing the dominance of
the traditional ‘transport bias’ in urban mobility
systems. Much has been documented about the
proliferation of institutions in both developed and
developing countries.32 The poor linkage between
land-use and transport planning has encouraged the
tendency towards increased transport investments.
The latter delivers immediate visible infrastructural
outputs – with direct outcomes and impacts –
benefiting a range of interests and having higher
political pay-off, at least in the short run.

second half of the twentieth century fostered a
spatial pattern that provided a justification for the
traditional transport bias of urban mobility systems.
The ‘Fordist’ pattern of accumulation – which
prevailed after the Second World War – promoted a
distinct spatial urban landscape and system of
governance, which was hierarchical and highly
fragmented. The core–periphery delineation was
replicated across all levels, with a set of cities
acquiring the status of global centres for driving the
system of globalization. At the city level, the centrality
of manufacturing and trading was facilitated through
spatial segregation and by maximizing the economies
of urbanization.33 Towards the last quarter of the
twentieth century, greenfield land, suburban housing
and urban infrastructural investments became the
avenues for illicit wealth generation that caused
the global financial crisis. In many parts of Europe,
the US and Latin America there are swaths of real
estate spread out in the suburban areas and exurban
regions that were part of such schemes. The highways
and boulevards leading to these sites further
enhanced the motorization trend.34
It has been estimated that between 1950 and
2005, raw material extraction (biomass, fossil-energy
carriers, ores and industrial minerals, construction
minerals) increased from 10 to 60 billion metric
tonnes, excluding water and land resources.35 The
most significant increase came from the extraction
of construction materials and ores/industrial minerals.
In 1900, biomass accounted for almost 75 per cent
of total material use; however its share had dropped
to only one-third by 2005, indicating that the global
economy has gradually reduced its dependence on
renewable materials (i.e. biomass) and increased its
dependence on finite mineral resources, which
cannot be replaced.36 While demand was increasing, for a long time prices were also declining, thus
encouraging increased dependence on the finite
resources, including, in this case, motorization as the
dominant mode of mobility.

TRENDS AND CONDITIONS
IN TRANSPORT-ORIENTED
MOBILITY SYSTEMS
This section provides an overview of global trends
and conditions, with transport as the main focus of
improving mobility and enabling access. It examines
formal and informal modes of transport, including
walking and cycling. Furthermore, the implications
of rapid motorization on economic performance
and social equity in cities are discussed. An overview
of the alternative to transport-oriented mobility will
be provided in chapters 5 to 8; specifically, the components of an accessibility-based sustainable mobility.

Varying but declining dominance of
public transport
In 2005, 16 per cent of all trips in urban areas
worldwide were by some form of public transport (i.e.
formal, institutionally recognized services, such as
buses and rail-based public transport) (Figure 1.4).
The role of public transport in individual cities varies
widely, accounting for 45 per cent of urban trips in
some cities of Eastern Europe and Asia, 10 to 20 per
cent in much of Western Europe and Latin America,
and less than 5 per cent in North America and SubSaharan Africa.37 In 2001, more than half of all
mechanized trips (i.e. excluding walking) in Hong
Kong and Eastern European cities (such as Bucharest,
Romania; Moscow, Russia; and Warsaw, Poland) were
by public transport, compared to an average of about
25 per cent for Western European cities, and less
than 10 per cent in the high-income, car-oriented
cities of Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Melbourne
(Australia) and Chicago (US). However even within
Western Europe, the role of public transport varies
sharply, capturing more than a third of all mechanized
trips in rail-served cities such as Berlin (Germany),
Helsinki (Finland), Lisbon (Portugal) and Vienna
(Austria) and fewer than 10 per cent of mechanized
trips in European cities such as Ghent (Belgium), Lille
(France) and Glasgow (UK).38
In cities of developing countries, the role of
public transport varies markedly, particularly among
African cities. Only a handful of Sub-Saharan Africa
cities (such as Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Abidjan, Côte
d’Ivoire; and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso) have
reasonably well-developed, institutionalized public
bus services that account for 25 to 35 per cent of
all motorized trips.39 Most other parts of Sub-Saharan
Africa are characterized by private paratransit and
informal operators, with local buses serving only a
small fraction of trips, if any. In fact, in most of SubSaharan Africa, and poorer parts of South and
Southeast Asia, government-sponsored public transport services are either inadequate or non-existent.40
However, in North Africa, many cities have well-

developed public transport systems, including formal
buses and informal shared taxis, and rail-based modes.
In Egypt for example, Cairo’s metro has been
operational and expanding since 1987. Similarly, a
modern light rail system in Tunis, Tunisia, has been
successfully operating since the early 1990s. In
Cairo, public transport (formal and informal) accounts
for more than 75 per cent of daily motorized trips.41
In South-Eastern Asia, conventional 50-passenger buses are the workhorse of the public transport
networks of most cities. In Bangkok, Thailand,
50 per cent of passenger trips are by bus, rising to
75 per cent during peak hours.42 In Eastern Asia,
buses serve slightly larger shares of mechanized trips
than metros in Taipei, China (14.4 versus 12.9 per
cent) and Shanghai, China (12.9 per cent versus 5.7
per cent); whereas metros are more dominant in
Hong Kong, China (35.5 per cent of mechanized
trips); Seoul, Republic of Korea (34.8 per cent);
and greater Tokyo, Japan (57 per cent).43 Throughout
Latin America, buses dominate, even in rail-served
cities such as São Paulo (Brazil), Santiago (Chile)
and Buenos Aires (Argentina). As noted in Chapter
3, the world’s most extensive bus rapid transit (BRT)
networks are currently found in Latin America,
where a total of 18 cities currently have some form
of BRT system.44
Despite growing concerns over energy supplies,
climate change and access for the poor, public
transport’s modal share of trips is expected to decline
over the next decade in all world regions. If recent
trends continue, the number of trips made by public
transport will increase by around 30 per cent
between 2005 and 2025, an estimate that is far less
than the 80 per cent growth in trips by private
motorized vehicles over the same period.45 In recent
years, public transport’s downward spiral has been
most pronounced in Eastern Europe. The transition
to capitalist economies has brought with it substantial
public transport services cuts and disinvestments –
the same kind of vicious cycle that has marginalized
public transport in more advanced economies.
The declining market share of trips served by
public transport is cause for concern since they are
the most efficient forms of motorized mobility,
particularly for low-income earners. The low and
decreasing role of public transport renders it even
more complicated to foster an effective linkage
between land-use and transport planning. More effort
is devoted to control and regulation of the private
and informal sector operators whose main motivation
is increasing profit.

Informality
Worldwide, the informal transport sector provides
much-needed (and much-valued) mobility, particularly for the poor. The lack of affordable and accessible
public transport systems in developing countries has

led to the proliferation of informal operators, such
as private microbus and minibus services. These
modes help fill service gaps but can also worsen traffic
congestion and air quality. In some settings, informal
carriers are the only forms of public transport
available. In India, for example, only about 100 of
the more than 5000 cities and towns have formal
public transport systems. Accordingly, conventional
public transport has been replaced by more ubiquitous but less affordable paratransit such as
motorcycle taxis, rickshaws, jeepneys and jitneys.46
Since cities in poorer countries seldom have the
institutional and financial capacity to increase and
sustain public transport systems – and private firms
typically lack the capital and incentive to provide
comprehensive transport systems – small, private and
informal systems prevail. Like many market-based
solutions, they provide a service that must be filled,
but not without compromises to the environment and
lack of service to those who are marginalized or live
in less profit-rich locations.47 These are called
informal public transport or paratransit, because
they serve the public and are essentially providing a
public good.

Public transport’s
modal share of
trips is expected
to decline over
the next decade in
all world regions

Non-motorized transport
Non-motorized transportation is often the dominant
mode of urban mobility when public transport
services are poor and incomes are low. In 2005, about
37 per cent of urban trips worldwide were made by
foot or bicycle, which are the two major modes of
urban non-motorized transport (Figure 1.4). For very
short trips, walking is the main mode of transport in
both developed and developing countries. The modal
share of walking can be very high. In African
cities, walking accounts for 30–35 per cent of all
trips. In Dakar (Senegal) and Douala (Cameroon) the
share is much higher, at over 60 per cent.48 Evidence
shows that non-motorized transport is an important component in poorer and smaller cities, capturing as much as 90 per cent of all person-trips.49
Furthermore, in densely packed urban centres,
non-motorized transport provides access to places
that motorized modes cannot reach, and is often the
fastest means of getting around. In South Asia’s
densest, most congested cities, more than half of all
passenger and goods trips are by foot, bicycles or
rickshaw.50
Walking is often the only form of transport
for the very poor, when weather and topography
permit. Many people in developing countries are
‘captive walkers’, meaning that they walk because
they cannot afford an alternative. For them, having
a well-connected and safe pedestrian environment
is critical to meeting their daily needs.51 As the least
costly form of mobility, walking allows the very
poor to reduce their daily expenses, and thus has
significant poverty impacts. The most visible indicator

of poverty in many cities, particularly in developing countries, is the presence of slums and squatter
communities. Spatially, the field of movement in
these slums is very restricted, with such limitations
constraining income and employment opportunities
for the urban poor. As a result, the affected population is forced to restrict their travel to essential trips
related to work, education and shopping.
In pursuit of transport policies reflecting sustainable mobility, the promotion of walking and cycling
is very important. The bicycle is by far the most
energy-effective means of passenger transport and
offers a relatively inexpensive means of improving the accessibility of poor people. In developed
countries, bicycles are commonly used as a feeder
mode to public transport services. A well-known
example is the Netherlands, where bicycles are used
for more than 40 per cent of trips in some cities.52
Historically, bicycles are particularly important in
Chinese cities.53 Non-motorized transport shares
are highest in smaller Chinese cities, in the ranges
of 70 to 80 per cent.54
Bicycles serve relatively small shares of person
trips in many major African cities, however, cycling
is popular in smaller and secondary cities.55 Dangerous and crowded roads, and the absence of
protected lanes, have discouraged cycling in many
African cities.56 Still, bicycles can be an important
source of economic livelihoods, as evidenced in
Kisumu, Kenya, where bicycle-taxis (bodaboda) ferry
commuters across town at half the price of a matatu
ride or in Bukoba, Tanzania, where some residents
carry passengers or haul goods on their esekidos to
supplement their wages.57
In Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,
bicycles serve as ‘mass transport’ in the form of cycle
rickshaws, serving mostly women and children. In
Dhaka, Bangladesh, around 40 per cent of school trips
are by rickshaw.58 Also, rickshaw pulling often offers
an entry point into the labour market for unskilled
rural migrants to the cities of South Asia. In Dhaka,
20 per cent of the population, or 2.5 million people,
rely on rickshaw pulling for their livelihood, directly
or indirectly.59 This notwithstanding, rickshaws are
banned from Dhaka’s main roads for slowing
motorized traffic, and the view of some public officials
is that they detract from the city’s image as a modern
metropolis.

Traffic congestion
Traffic congestion is an undesirable by-product of
widespread mobility in cities worldwide, and a major
factor in restricting access in cities. A recent global
study of 20 major cities revealed that traffic congestion levels markedly worsened between 2007
and 2010.60 Motorists in Moscow, Russia, reported
an average daily delay of two and a half hours.61
With a 24 per cent annual growth rate in the number

of registered motor vehicles, traffic conditions
are deteriorating most rapidly in Beijing, China.62
In mid-2010, an ‘epic’ 100-kilometre, 9-day traffic
jam was reported in China’s Heibei Province – along
a freeway that feeds into Beijing.63 The growing
popularity of helicopters is partly a response to the
rising congestion problem in Latin American cities
such as Mexico City (Mexico), Santiago (Chile) and
São Paulo (Brazil).64
Congestion has widespread impacts on the
urban quality of life, consumption of fossil fuels, air
pollution and economic growth and prosperity. World
Bank studies from the 1990s estimated that traffic
congestion lowered the GDP of cities by some 3–6
per cent, with the higher value applying mostly to
rapidly growing cities (e.g. places with busy port
traffic, reliance on just-in-time inventorying and
manufacturing, and other time-sensitive activities).65
Time losses from traffic congestion are estimated to
cost the equivalent of 2 per cent of GDP in Europe
and 2–5 per cent in Asia.66 The hidden external costs
of traffic congestion in Metro Manila (the Philippines), Dakar (Senegal) and Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire)
have been pegged at nearly 5 per cent of those cities’
GDPs.67 Such costs not only exact a burden on the
present generation, but also commit future
generations to long-term debts, which can eventually
slow global growth.
Traffic congestion is a major indication of the
disjuncture between land-use planning and transport systems. It not only exposes the limitation of
a transport-oriented bias to mobility, but it also
reveals the efficiency of land-use systems in a given
city. Limited road capacity, in the face of growing
demand for motorized mobility, partly explains
deteriorating traffic conditions. In general, the percentage of the total land area devoted to streets68
in developing-country cities is considerably lower
than in the cities of developed countries.69 In India,
the annual growth rate in traffic during the 1990s
was around 5 per cent in Mumbai, 7 per cent in
Chennai and 10 per cent in Delhi. However, none
of these cities have expanded their road supply by
even 1 per cent annually.70
In most developing-country cities, the inadequate quantity and structure of road infrastructure
is often associated with rapid population growth. For
instance, Nairobi, Kenya – a city with approximately
3.5 million inhabitants – has a shortage of collector
streets and major thoroughfares to serve traffic
demands, compared to developed-country cities
of a similar size. The city’s arterials are mostly radial
and the lack of circumferential roads force-funnels
many peripheral trips through the central business
district, with widespread effects on traffic flows.71
Central Bangkok, Thailand, has a fishbone street
pattern, featuring narrow local streets that channel
most motorized trips onto oversaturated thoroughfares. The absence of many collector-distributor

roads has contributed to inefficient patterns of traffic
flows.72
Congested road infrastructure in developing countries, is further exacerbated by forms of encroachment onto the carriageway, or excessive
provisions for local access. The most common forms
of encroachment are caused by street hawkers
and informal transport operators, which combine to
block the smooth flow of traffic. In Sub-Saharan
Africa, street vendors occupy around a third of
road space in crowded cities.73 A further congestionrelated problem is the absence of traffic management
in many developing countries. Phnom Penh, Cambodia – a city of nearly 2 million inhabitants – has
864 kilometres of roads, but just 36 traffic signals.74
In Lebanon, congestion is made worse by inadequate
road signage, a failure to manage limited supplies of
parking and a culture of aggressive, unruly driving.75
Freight movements can also contribute to
congestion. In most poor countries, the goodsmovement sector lacks basic infrastructure, such as
freight terminals, warehousing, parking and staging
areas, freight-forwarding centres and other logistical
needs. Few developing-country cities specifically
plan for freight movements, thus a haphazard, dysfunctional arrangement of urban logistics is often
the rule. An example is Lomé, Togo, where the
absence of a bypass road around the city causes trucks
to leave the port and head directly into the core
of the city.76 Heavy trucks contribute to (and suffer
from) poor-quality roads – because wear-and-tear
exponentially rises with the dead-axle weight of a
vehicle (e.g. one heavily loaded truck can inflict as
much road damage as 10,000 passing cars).77 Consequently, road decay worsens congestion and increases
the operating costs.

SUSTAINABILITY
CHALLENGES OF URBAN
MOBILITY
78

Building on the seminal Brundtland Report of 1987,
a sustainable urban mobility system is one that
satisfies current mobility needs of cities without
compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.79 The idea of sustainability
in urban mobility has moved beyond a focus on
ecology and the natural environment to also include
social, economic and institutional dimensions.
Furthermore, it has moved beyond the preoccupation
with movement and flows within urban settings to
looking at enhancing proximity in space. A holistic
and integrated approach to urban land-use and transport planning and investment is needed if urban
areas are to become socially, environmentally and
economically sustainable.

Accordingly, four pillars of sustainability are
considered in the review and analysis of urban
mobility in this report; namely the social, environmental, economic and institutional dimensions.
These are not separate or isolated, as there are
important synergies and co-benefits. For instance,
pursuing economic sustainability can also confer
environmental benefits, such as instituting taxation
policies that also conserve energy. In the early
2000s, Japan phased in reduced ownership taxes
on fuel-efficient vehicles by 25 to 50 per cent and
imposed higher charges on large-engine vehicles,
including vehicles that were more than ten years of
age.80 While regulatory and fiscal instruments can be
used to promote urban sustainability, as mentioned
earlier, the most effective mechanism is the effective
utilization of the planning process.

Integration of land-use and transport
planning
As pointed out in the preceding sections, the ultimate
goal of mobility is the capacity to traverse urban
space. Relationships between locations, as well as
impediments and conveniences between them, are
critical in determining the ease and convenience of
accessing them. The development of a sustainable
transportation system starts with the organization of
urban space. The main objective is to reduce the need
for mobility by reducing the number of trips and
length of travel distance. As a result, urban density
is optimized and functionality of urban places
enhanced. Sustainability entails a shift of emphasis
from transportation to people and places. In
operational terms, it still calls for improvement in
transportation systems and even advocates for
innovations in other modes of communication, while
giving emphasis to streamlining space utilization in
its relationship with people.
Neglecting the connection between land use and
mobility has created the urban sprawl evidenced in
most cities today. During the period since the Second
World War, the urban land area in developed
countries has doubled, while it has grown by a factor
of five in developing countries.81 From 1995 to
2005, 85 per cent of the 78 largest cities in developed
countries experienced a faster growth in their
suburban areas than their urban cores.82 In Europe,
studies of land-cover changes reveal that cities in
Estonia, Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and
Bulgaria are experiencing the most sprawl.83
In many developing countries, urban sprawl
comprises of two main contrasting types of development in the same city. The first is characterized by
large peri-urban areas with informal and illegal
patterns of land use. This is combined with a lack of
infrastructure, public facilities and basic services, and
is often accompanied by little or no public transport
and by inadequate access roads. The other is a form

of ‘suburban sprawl’ in which residential zones for
high- and middle-income groups and highly valued
commercial and retail complexes are well connected
for private motorized vehicles rather than by public
transport.
In the absence of regulatory controls and farsighted urban planning, the pace of sprawl will most
likely accelerate. Spread-out patterns of growth not
only increase the dependence on the private car, but
also consume farmland and open space, threaten
estuaries and natural habitats, and burden municipal
treasuries with the high costs of expanding urban
infrastructure and services.
Land-use planning also entails paying attention
to the multiple scales of urban mobility. It traverses
from the regional and metropolitan levels, through
the city linkages and down to the neighbourhood and
street level. The urban form – emerging either from
a haphazard process of locating settlements and
activities, or from strategically planned intervention
– makes a big difference in mobility systems.
Similarly, the design of streets and neighbourhood
blocks promotes a sense of place and determines the
accessibility of such neighbourhoods. The very
physical configuration of the street may either
encourage or discourage walking and bicycling. Key
considerations for sustainable mobility include the
pattern of street arrangement, the length of blocks
and the relationship of buildings to pathways, stations
and central places.
The percentage of urban land allocated to streets
is one of the factors that influence the level of connectivity within urban areas. Another factor is how
appropriately the streets are laid out to cater for the
various mobility modes used within the city. A study
found that a large number of cities in developing
countries have low percentages of urban land
allocated to streets; for example, 6 per cent in Bangui
(Central African Republic), 6.1 per cent in Yerevan
(Armenia), 11.1 per cent in Accra (Ghana) and 12.3
per cent in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso).84 This is
despite the fact that these cities are experiencing
rapid rates of urbanization, a phenomenon which is
poised to impact on their mobility and hence levels
of accessibility. The same study found that cities in
developed countries had significantly higher percentages of land allocated to streets, the average rate
being 29 per cent.85 The linkages between urban land
allocated to streets and the planning of accessible
cities are discussed further in Chapter 5.
Land-use and transport planning have been called
for and to some extent addressed since the 1970s.
Nevertheless, a persisting challenge remains the
application of integrated land-use and transport
planning in practice, as well as dealing with existing
transport infrastructure and land-use patterns that
cannot always be easily changed, particularly in old
middle-size or larger cities. Accordingly, research
needs to be directed to such pragmatic issues. It is

in making such critical decisions with respect to
places and people that the pillars and principles of
sustainability can be operationalized.

Social dimensions
Urban transport is socially sustainable when mobility
benefits are equally and fairly distributed, with few
if any inequalities in access to transport infrastructure and services based on income, social and physical
differences (including gender, ethnicity, age or disabilities). Social sustainability is rooted in the
principle of accessibility wherein equality exists
among all groups in terms of access to basic goods,
services and activities – such as work, education,
medical care, shopping, socializing – and to enable
people to participate in civic life. It recognizes the
critical importance of mobility and accessibility in fully
enjoying human rights.
As earlier indicated, one important aspect of
accessibility is the affordability of transport modes.
Affordable transportation means that people,
including those with low incomes, can afford access
to basic services and activities (healthcare, shopping,
school, work and social activities) without budget
strain. For many urban dwellers in developing
countries, the availability of reliable and affordable
public transport services can be the difference
between being integrated into the economic and
social life of a city or not. Unaffordable mobility
prevents the urban poor from breaking out of the
shackles of inter-generational poverty. Furthermore,
exorbitant expenditures on public transport take
money away from other essential needs, such as food,
health care, education and shelter.
Where governments are unable to construct and
subsidize public transport services, travellers often
have to pay large, sometimes exorbitant, shares of
their incomes to private, often informal, paratransit
operators. Setting prices at whatever amount the
market will bear, informal operators invariably
charge more per kilometre travelled than publicly
supported ones. In the poor informal housing settlements on the outskirts of Mexico City – beyond the
service jurisdiction of the city’s metro system –
residents sometimes take two to three separate
collectivos (shared-ride taxis and microbuses) to reach
a metro terminal that provides low-cost connections
to the city and job opportunities.86 Travel can consume 25 per cent or more of daily wages.87 Time costs
can also be exorbitant: 20 per cent of workers in
Mexico City spend more than three hours travelling
to and from work each day.88 Studies show that taking
a series of informal minibuses and motorized tricycles
to and from work can cost 20 to 25 per cent of daily
wages in rapidly growing cities such as Delhi (India),
Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Manila (the Philippines), and as much as 30 per cent in Nairobi (Kenya),
Pretoria (South Africa) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania).89

tries,94 despite these countries accounting for only
33 per cent of the world’s motor vehicles.95 Road
safety levels differ sharply between developing and
developed countries and the gap is widening. In the
latter part of the twentieth century, road accident
fatalities fell in developed countries but rose sharply
elsewhere – e.g. 300 per cent increase from 1980
to 2000 in Africa.96 The World Health Organization
(WHO) predicts road traffic deaths in low-income
countries will more than double between 2005 and
2030, while they are expected to fall in wealthier
nations.97 Rapid urbanization, greater reliance on
motorized transport to move people and goods,
growing income disparities and lax enforcement of
traffic laws, are among the factors that account for
rising road traffic crashes and fatalities.98

Social sustainability also has gender, age and
disability dimensions. A majority of women in many
parts of the world are less likely to have access to
individual means of transport, be they cars or bikes:
in Bamako (Mali), 87 per cent of women versus 57
per cent of men walk for virtually all trips; in Chennai
(India), 83 versus 63 per cent; and in Chengdu
(China), 59 versus 39 per cent.90 In addition, women
often create complex trip chains – e.g. taking children
to school followed by shopping and other errands –
so as to make traditional fixed-route bus services
impractical, forcing them to rely on more expensive
door-to-door services (whether by private car in
developed countries or by rickshaws, bicycles, motorcycle taxis in poorer countries). Other transportrelated burdens faced by women are: lack of
pavements and safe crosswalks; sexual harassment
in overcrowded buses; and personal security threats
from unlighted streets and public transport stops.
In many developed countries, the elderly and
disabled have statutory rights that guarantee equal
and full accessibility to public facilities like pavements, rail-based public transport and buses, such
as legislated in the Americans with Disabilities Act
in the US. Few developing countries provide such
protection, or design streets and transport infrastructure, to enable access for the elderly and disabled. Young people constitute a group at further risk
of transport disadvantage. In Sub-Saharan Africa,
school-age children and youth often walk long
distances, along congested corridors, to reach schools,
exposing them to accident risks and all sorts of
hardships and deprivations.91
Safety is a crucial aspect of a high-quality urban
mobility system. It includes the safety of infrastructures and of the rolling stock, as well as citizen’s
safety in reaching the system (e.g. walking from
home to the bus stop). Road accidents have become
a global pandemic. Each year, around 1.2 million
people are killed and a further 20–50 million injured
in road traffic accidents worldwide.92 Road crashes
result in economic costs of up to 3 per cent of GDP.93
The vast majority of road traffic accident deaths
(more than 90 per cent) occur in developing coun-

Environmental dimensions
Many of the environmental challenges in the urban
transport sector are rooted in its reliance on the
non-renewable fossil fuel to propel private motor
vehicles. The share of the world’s oil consumption
accounted for by transportation increased from
45.4 per cent in 1973 to 61.5 per cent in 2010,
with the sector expected to continue to sustain
the increasing demands for oil (Figure 1.5). World
reserves of conventional oil exceed what has been
used to date, but with rapid motorization, many
observers believe it is unlikely that this energy source
will last beyond the mid-century mark.99 As demand
for transportation fuels rises, prices increase.100 End
consumers have to cope with a rise in prices of petrol
and diesel fuels for motorized travel.
Rising greenhouse gas emissions and global
temperatures underscore the urgency of weaning
the transport sector from its dependency on oil
and automobility. Globally, 13 per cent of all
greenhouse gas emissions come from the transport
sector and three-quarters of this is caused by road
transport.101 By 2050, global carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions from motor vehicle use could be three
times as large as they were in 2010.102 The transport sector’s footprint, however, varies widely across

cities, accounting for 11 per cent of greenhouse gas
emissions in Shanghai and Beijing (China), 20 per
cent in New York City (US) and London (UK), 35
per cent in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Mexico City,
45 per cent in Houston and Atlanta (US), and 60 per
cent in São Paulo (Brazil).103 Levels of energy consumption for transport vary significantly even among
cities with similar GDPs, depending on urban form,
financing and taxation policies, and the quality and
affordability of alternative modes. As urban form gets
more compact and dense, CO2 emissions from transport decline. For instance, Austria’s urban areas are
more than four times denser than Australia’s, and
generate only 60 per cent of the amount of CO2 per
capita that Australia’s urban areas generate.104 Mode
share is also an important factor: energy consumption
levels decrease as the share of trips on public transport and non-motorized modes increases. In 2007,
per capita energy consumption in the transport sector
was more than three times higher in the US than in
Japan and Germany.105 This is partly explained by the
modal share in these countries; in Japan, for example,
40 per cent of all urban motorized trips are made by
public transport, compared to only 4 per cent in the
US.106 Indeed, greenhouse gas emissions per passenger of public transport (bus, rail and trams) is about
one-twelfth that of the car.107
The urban transport sector is also a major source
of air and noise pollution, with serious public health
impacts. Long-term repeated exposure to high levels
of ozone and particulates can diminish lung functions
and trigger asthma and other respiratory illnesses.

Economic dimensions
Translating
visions and plans

urban mobility
depends on the
presence of
supportive and
nurturing
governance, as
well as sound
institutional and
regulatory
structures

The urban transport sector is economically sustainable when resources are efficiently used and
distributed to maximize the benefits and minimize
the external costs of mobility. This safeguards investments in and maintenance of transport infrastructure
and assets. The translation of investments into walkways, bikeways, railways and roadways creates jobs,
encourages business expansion and increases
economic output. Increasingly, the litmus test of costeffective transport infrastructure is whether the
project is ‘bankable’ – capable of attracting loans and
private investors.
Urban transport infrastructure is expensive. It
can consume a large share of the public budget
in emerging economies. In Ho Chi Minh City, Viet
Nam, a US$5 billion subway is currently under construction and in Jakarta, Indonesia, a new ring road
is expected to cost a similar amount.108 Crafting
reliable and equitable funding programmes for transport infrastructure that reward efficient and sustainable behaviour remains a formidable challenge.
Public transport often faces serious fiscal challenges. Almost universally, public transport systems
rely on public subsidies. Cities that finance the

costs of public transport operations can face severe
fiscal burdens. Experiences show that in many
cases operating subsidies are used to finance higher
worker compensation and benefit packages, without
commensurate improvements in public transport
services.109 In developing countries, cities without
adequate fiscal resources end up relying on informal
sector operators to fill the gaps. Lower-income cities
that borrow funds in foreign currency to build transport infrastructure also face the risk of having to pay
back loans with devalued local currency.
Another fiscal challenge cities face worldwide
is paying for ongoing road maintenance and expansion. Taxes on fuels are usually the primary means
of funding road infrastructure. However, increased
fuel economy, combined with travel saturation, has
reduced such revenues in developed countries. For
example, fuel economy improvements in France that
reduce CO2 emissions of the average diesel car from
160 to 130 grams per kilometre, have at the same
time dramatically reduced government revenues.110
This has called for a shift to kilometre-based taxes,
something which is now possible given technological
advances such as global positioning systems (GPS)
and radio frequency identification devices.

Institutional and governance dimensions
Translating visions and plans for sustainable urban
mobility depends on the presence of supportive and
nurturing governance, as well as sound institutional
and regulatory structures. The ability to manage
and respond to escalating demands for urban travel
– i.e. to plan, predict, foresee, preserve rights-ofway, build, operate and maintain facilities – is often
limited in developing countries. The lack of adequate
institutional capacity – whether in the form of a
trained and educated civil-service talent pool, or
a transparent and largely corruption-free procurement process for providing transport infrastructure
and services – poses immense challenges in advancing
sustainable urban transport.
Institutional fragmentation undermines the
ability to coordinate urban transportation services.111
Separating urban sector functions into different
organizations – each with its own boards, staff,
budgets and by-laws – often translates into unisectoral actions and missed opportunities, such as
the failure to site new housing projects near BRT
stations. Multiple public transport service providers
can mean uncoordinated bus and rail schedules,
multiple fare payments (which increase user costs)
and facility designs that are poorly integrated. In
addition, bloated bureaucracies are notorious for
waste and delays in the deployment of urban transport projects.
Another institutional void is the minimal
involvement of citizens and broad-based community
interests in the planning and design of urban trans-

port facilities and services. Decision-making needs
to be more inclusive, transparent and democratic.
Decentralizing decision-making ensures greater voice
and legitimacy to non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) and civil society.
Lack of capacity for strategic planning and
coordination is a major problem in many cities of the
world, particularly in developing countries. Institutions rarely have sufficient time or funds to expand
transport infrastructure fast enough to accommodate
travel demands. The ability to advance sustainable
mobility programmes or introduce efficient pricing
schemes presumes something that rarely exists – a
well-managed transport authority that sets clear and
measurable objectives and rigorously appraises the
expenditure of funds in a transparent and accountable
manner.112 Often, the mechanisms for coordinated
multi-sectoral planning are either weak or absent.
Understanding the linkage between land-use and
urban transport planning is important for the multiplicity of actors, levels and institutions involved.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND STRUCTURE OF THE
REPORT
This chapter has provided an overview of the implications of the unfolding events of rapid urbanization,
hyper-mobility and the health and climate hazards
associated with car-dependent cities – all of which
are inextricably linked. During the past 100 years,
the structural foundations for today’s urban mobility
systems were derived from developmental circumstances, when resources were cheap, urban populations were low and modes of communication were
limited. However, while the global trends discussed
in this chapter pose uncertainties and risks, there are
also unprecedented opportunities for advancing sustainable urban mobility.
In order to become more sustainable, cities
should be more compact, encourage mixed land use
and prioritize sustainable modes of mobility such as
public and non-motorized transport. Furthermore,
urban mobility systems need to be inclusive, providing
mobility opportunities for all. Improved urban
planning will be critical toward designing and retrofitting cities to better accommodate sustainable
modes. Compact, mixed-use cities with high-quality
pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, combined with
policy measures that charge the true social cost of

using private motorized vehicles, offer the best hope
of increasing the modal shares of sustainable modes
of mobility.
A paradigm shift is also needed in how transport users think about transportation and its relationship to the city. Of particular significance is the need
for government institutions and planning processes
to emphasize accessibility over mobility. Furthermore, policies to encourage sustainable urban mobility should take into account social, environmental,
economic as well as institutional dimensions of sustainability. This calls for a more holistic and inclusive
framework for the planning, design and provision of
urban mobility systems and services. Accordingly,
translating visions and plans for sustainable urban
transport futures depends on the presence of a
supportive governance and regulatory structure.
The following nine chapters of this report analyse
global trends, conditions and policy responses with
respect to urban mobility. They investigate the
connection between transport and various aspects
of urban form, and suggest measures towards the
promotion of sustainable mobility. The discussion
in the next three chapters focuses on trends and
conditions with respect to the two main categories
of urban transport: passenger transport in Chapters
2 and 3 and goods transport in Chapter 4. The
evidence presented in these chapters shows that,
urban transport policy and planning challenges in
developing countries and countries with economies
in transition differ significantly from those found in
the urban areas of developed countries; as do the
resources and institutional frameworks at the disposal
of policy-makers and planners. Notwithstanding, the
best choice of policy responses will also vary within
each region and even within countries.
Chapter 5 serves as the anchor of this report,
exposing the basis of the prevailing anomalies and
opportunities for corrective intervention. It looks at
the interrelation between mobility and the spatial
structure of the city, while stressing the need to
reconfigure urban form to enhance accessibility. The
importance of integrating transport and land-use
planning is emphasized while the underlying principles of sustainable development provide the
normative framework for change. The policy implications discussed in Chapter 5 lay the ground for
the subsequent discussion in Chapters 6 to 9, which
focus on the social, environmental, economic and
institutional dimensions of sustainable mobility.
Chapter 10 concludes the report and presents policy
recommendations on how to enhance the sustainability of urban mobility systems.

CHAPTER

2

THE STATE OF URBAN
PASSENGER TRANSPORT
In a world that is predominantly urban, the ability
of people to move within cities to access jobs,
services and amenities is a critical driver of sustainability. Indeed, access to affordable, safe and environmentally friendly means of transport is a prerequisite
for the wellbeing of urban dwellers as well as for the
balanced functioning and prosperity of cities. While
progress has been made in this respect, considerable
challenges remain in widening the accessibility of
sustainable transport in cities across the world. While
developing countries are disproportionately shouldering an overwhelming share of the urban transport
challenges, developed countries also face their own
array of difficulties, compounded currently by undercurrents of global financial uncertainty.
This chapter provides an overview of the state
of urban passenger transport globally, focusing on
four key modes of transport namely non-motorized
transport (NMT), formal public transport, informal
(motorized) transport and private motorized transport (Box 2.1). Goods movement in urban areas is
covered in Chapter 4, given its unique and crucial
yet often overlooked role. The four modes of passenger transport are reviewed here in the context of
developed and developing countries, illustrating

extensive variation in trends and conditions, and thus
accessibility (as elaborated in Chapter 1). The impacts
of these trends and conditions are highlighted briefly
as a precursor to a more detailed review of the same
in Chapters 6, 7 and 8.
This review illustrates the central role of NMT
in developing countries and a growing interest in
these modes in developed countries. Formal public
transport has varying levels of importance within,
and/or between, cities of both developing and
developed countries. Informal transport, although
playing a limited role in developed countries, is
found to be the principal transport mode in developing countries, to the extent that in some it is being
co-opted as part of formal public transport provision.
Thereafter, the enormous growth in private motorized transport in many developing countries is
reviewed, as are the patterns of dependence on this
mode in developed countries. Importantly, also,
the chapter considers the critical role of integration
across different modes of transport in cities, and
highlights experiences of cities that have invested in
intermodality.
The trends and conditions of urban transport
described in this chapter have been directly

Box 2.1 Modes of urban transport
Non-motorized transport refers to the transportation of
passengers via human or animal powered means including
bicycles, rickshaws, pedicabs, animal-drawn carts and walking.
With animal power being largely a rural feature, the focus in
this report is on human-powered modes (bicycles, cycle
rickshaws) and walking.
Formal public transport services are those available to the
public for payment, run on specified routes to timetables with
set fares, and within the context of this report, in an urban
area. They may be operated by public or private organizations
and cover a wide range of modes, namely bus, light rail
(tramways and street cars), metros, suburban rail, as well as
waterborne transport (ferries, boats).

Informal (motorized) transport (also referred to as
‘paratransit’) relies on privately owned vehicles whose
operators often lack necessary permits or do not meet
requirements for vehicle size, insurance coverage or driver
standards. Even if some operators are fully licensed, they may
deviate from routes or charge unauthorized higher fares, as a
result of which they are considered informal.
Private motorized transport involves vehicles that are
powered by an engine and are used by individuals or private
companies to transport passengers. Light-duty vehicles (cars,
SUVs, light trucks and mini-vans) and two- or three-wheelers
remain the key modes of private motorized transport in urban
areas.

influenced by land-use and urban planning decisions
taken at neighbourhood, local and regional levels
(Chapter 5), resulting in particular urban forms
and functionality that hinder or facilitate accessibility.
In turn, transport investments and policies have
influenced the development of urban form and
functionality in particular ways, thereby impacting on
access to mobility. The interaction between the
development of urban spatial patterns and transport
is thus a key factor shaping accessibility in cities both
in physical and socioeconomic terms.

NON-MOTORIZED
TRANSPORT
Walking is the
principal means of
transportation in
cities of
developing
countries . . . not
by choice, but
rather driven by
the lack of
affordable and
accessible
alternatives

This section highlights the trends and conditions of
NMT around the world, including the provision
of appropriate infrastructure, as well as the related
benefits and challenges. Globally, walking and
bicycling are the dominant modes of NMT. Yet, the
needs of NMT users are often ignored, while pedestrians and cyclists together form a significant fraction
of traffic accident victims. Most cities do not have
dedicated infrastructure, and even if some European
cities have been remodelled to become pedestrian
and bicycle friendly, NMT users typically negotiate
hostile urban environments. In London, UK, for
instance, many cyclists are killed annually by turning
trucks, despite the presence of bicycle lanes.

Developing countries

In recent years,
there has been a
decline in cycling
in some Asian
cities [due] to
rising incomes
and concomitant
motorization, as
well as changing
social perceptions

NMT is the principal mode of transportation in most
cities of developing countries, particularly Africa and
Asia (Figure 2.1). In Dakar (Senegal), for instance,
walking and cycling accounts for 71 per cent of trips
while in Douala (Cameroon) it accounts for 60 per
cent. In Asia, the combined average share of cycling
and walking in Chinese cities, for instance, is 65 per
cent.1 Beijing, for instance, has a combined modal
share of walking and cycling of 53 per cent. In Indian
cities (such as Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Delhi and
Mumbai) walking and cycling account for about a
third of all trips. In Latin America, walking and
cycling constitute more than one-third of the trips
in cities such as Santiago, Chile (37 per cent), Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil (37 per cent) and Guadalajara,
Mexico (39 per cent), but are less significant in others
such as Buenos Aires, Argentina (9 per cent), La Paz,
Bolivia (10 per cent) and Caracas, Venezuela (18 per
cent).2
Walking is the principal means of transportation
in cities of developing countries. This is largely not
by choice, but rather driven by the lack of affordable
and accessible alternatives, with most pedestrians
belonging to lower income groups.3 Among low-

income groups in Santiago (Chile), NMT provides a
modal share of over 50 per cent, compared to only
10 per cent among high-income groups.4 In Kenya,
the majority of Nairobi’s slum inhabitants walk as they
cannot afford motorized transport.5 On average,
walking accounts for a significant proportion of trips
in African cities, and is particularly common among
women and children.6
Cycling caters for the mobility needs of considerable numbers of urban dwellers in developingcountry cities, especially in Asia. In mainland China,
bicycle ownership is much higher than in other Asian
countries, with an estimated 600 million bicycles.7
In India, household bicycle ownership rates are
high in cities such as Delhi (38 per cent), Ahmedabad
(54 per cent) and Chandigarh (63 per cent).8 This
is reflected in the relatively higher modal share of
cycling in these cities – Delhi (12 per cent) and
Ahmedabad (14 per cent). In some Asian countries
with relatively higher incomes, however, the modal
share of cycling is much lower, such as in Singapore
(1.6 per cent of work trips),9 the Republic of Korea
(1.2 per cent)10 and Hong Kong SAR (0.5 per cent).11
In recent years, there has been a decline in
cycling in some Asian cities. This has been attributed
to rising incomes and concomitant motorization, as
well as changing social perceptions, which tends to
see cycling as a means of transport for the poor. India
is a case in point where bicycle modal shares declined
from 30 per cent in 1994 to 11 per cent in 2008.12
Numbers also decreased in China, particularly in big
cities.13
In African cities, cycling plays a comparatively
limited role, accounting for less than 3 per cent of
total trips in capital cities such as Bamako (Mali),
Dakar (Senegal), Harare (Zimbabwe), Nairobi (Kenya)
and Niamey (Niger). Cycling appears to be more
popular in smaller and secondary cities such as
Morogoro (Tanzania) and Eldoret (Kenya) where it
constitutes 23 per cent and 12 per cent of total trips,
respectively.14 In Latin America, cycling makes up
only a small share of total transport trips, with bicycle
use being more in intermediate sized cities than in
larger ones. For example, while in Curico (Chile) the
modal share is 9 per cent, the average share across
Chile is under 2 per cent.15
The three-wheeled rickshaw is a popular type
of urban transport in Asia, especially in Cambodia,
Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, the Philippines and
Viet Nam. Known as pedicabs (padyak) in Metro
Manila (the Philippines), they are able to operate in
narrow alleys, walkways and other areas which are
impenetrable by other modes such as jeepneys (converted jeep taxis) and buses. In Bandung (Indonesia),
pedicabs known as becaks make up 33 per cent of
all trips.16 In contrast, cycle rickshaws are uncommon
in Africa, although they did exist in the 1990s in
Kigali (Rwanda) and Bujumbura (Burundi).17 The use
of tricycles however has been met with mixed

reactions by city authorities in several Asian countries. Jakarta (Indonesia) banned becaks in the 1970s
considering them obsolete, unsafe and hindering
traffic flow, while Viet Nam banned tricycles in
2008.18 In Mandalay (Myanmar), use in the central
business district is limited to daytime.19 The city of
Udon Thani (Thailand), by contrast, is actively promoting cycle rickshaws as an alternative to cars.20

Other

dependent countries such as Australia, Canada and
the US, and over 20 per cent in most European
countries. The share of journeys on foot is higher in
European countries, but less than in Australia, Canada
and the US (Figure 2.2).
Bicycle ownership is high in Western Europe,
especially in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark
(Figure 2.3). This has been attributed to the transport and land-use policies introduced since the mid1970s in these countries in favour of NMT and
public transport facilities rather than motorized
transport. The ratio of bicycles to inhabitants is
lower in other European countries such as Hungary
and France, as well as in the US and Canada. Cycling

Generally, developing-country cities have poor quality
infrastructure for NMT. Dedicated corridors are
largely absent and, where they exist, they are often
at the risk of being encroached upon for commercial purposes or used for the perennial widening of
motorized carriageways.23 Poor lighting, absence of
footpaths and overcrowding make walking unsafe
in these countries.24 Furthermore, limited speed
enforcement does little to deter high traffic speeds.
In the absence of segregated NMT infrastructure, the
dangers poised by speeding vehicles result in low
cycling rates.25 The general lack of provision and
maintenance of NMT facilities in cities of develop-

in the US is mostly for recreational and fitness
purposes, whereas in Europe it is a key means of
movement for utilitarian purposes.21
A recent trend with respect to NMT in developed-country cities has been the increasing popularity of three-wheeled pedicabs. For instance, annual
trips by such pedicabs have been estimated at 1 million
in London (UK) and 250,000 in Berlin (Germany).22
Nevertheless, this mode of transport is still insignificant in the cities of developed countries.

ing countries is primarily a problem of financing. Such
facilities are not considered to be ‘revenuegenerating’ and private investors and international
lending agencies are thus not keen to finance such
expenditures. Furthermore, the costs of such
NMT facilities are often considered to be beyond city
capabilities.26 However, as discussed later in this
report, the result of this is that public expenditures
tend to focus on provision of infrastructure for the
small minority that can afford to own a private car,
in effect subsidizing the wealthiest road users.
Across Africa, provision for segregated infrastructure for NMT is limited. In Nairobi (Kenya), 95
per cent of roads have high pedestrian flows
but only 20 per cent have pedestrian footpaths,27
while in Kampala (Uganda) more than 60 per cent
of road networks have no footpath segregated from
motorized traffic. In Lagos (Nigeria), NMT space is
inadequately protected.28 There are some exceptions,
however, such as Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), where
dedicated lanes were built in the 1980s. Unfortunately, these lanes have become unsafe due to the
encroachment by high-speed motorcycles.29
NMT infrastructure conditions in most Asian
cities are similarly inadequate. Out of the transportrelated projects approved under India’s Jawaharlal
Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, only 2.2 per

cent focused on pedestrian infrastructure (Figure
2.4). The majority of the roads in Delhi (India) do
not have pavements and those that exist are often
unusable.30 Some Chinese cities, by contrast, have
excellent bicycle infrastructure. In the recent past,
however, these have been invaded by electric bikes.31
The elimination or narrowing of sidewalks to accommodate more car lanes in Chinese cities has also been
reported.32
Infrastructure for NMT in some Latin American
cities is also in poor repair. For instance, in Cali,
Colombia, sidewalks are barely sufficient for one
person, poorly maintained, blocked by construction
waste, parked vehicles or informal vendors, and
have open sewerages. Car access ramps often discriminate against the disabled, persons with highheeled shoes and baby carriages (mostly women),
while a lack of lighting encourages the pedestrian
use of car lanes, and contributes to increased fear
of muggings. Furthermore, a significant proportion
of roads (30 per cent) are unpaved; pedestrians and
cyclists are exposed to dust, mud and air pollution.33
However, encouraging measures to enhance
NMT infrastructure have been observed in some
developing countries. In Colombia, for example,
Bogotá’s CicloRuta – a 340-kilometre bicycle path that
is connected to BRT routes, parks and community
centres – has registered considerable achievements
and resulted in a doubling of the proportion of the
population that used bikes between 2000 and
2007.34 The Republic of Korea’s Bicycle Master Plan
intends to build 30,000 kilometres of bike-ways

(primarily for recreational purposes) and increase the
modal share of cycling to 10 per cent by the end of
2019.35 In China, policies to promote NMT include
planned bicycle networks and parking at public transport stations in Beijing to increase ridership.36 Some
have also adopted bicycle sharing systems where
bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a very short-term basis. The Chinese cities
of Wuhan and Hangzhou have the largest bike sharing
systems in the world, with some 90,000 and 40,000
bikes, respectively.37
In developed countries, pedestrian infrastructure
has rapidly improved in recent decades with a number
of Western European cities investing heavily in
pedestrian areas and dedicated lanes. In Germany and
the Netherlands, there have been extensive efforts
to improve infrastructure for both walking and
cycling, with bike paths and lanes more than doubling in the Netherlands and tripling in Germany
between the late 1970s and mid-1990s (Box 2.2).
In contrast, investments to improve infrastructure for
walking and cycling in the US have been comparatively limited.38
An increasingly important approach in Western
Europe has been the integration of NMT and
motorized travel through urban design to enhance
the safety and quality of street space for pedestrians
and cyclists. Neighbourhood streets have been
redesigned in numerous cities in the UK, Denmark,
Sweden, German and the Netherlands to create
‘home zones’ accessible to cars, bicyclists and
pedestrians on equal terms, resulting in a significant

In Houten – a new town in the
Netherlands designed in the early 1970s
– cycle routes, with adjoining walkways,
form the backbone of the town plan.
The town consists of a number of neighbourhoods, each connected to the
railway station and the adjoining town
centre by tree-like systems of direct
cycle routes. Cars can enter each neighbourhood by way of an access road
from a ring road that encircles the town.
Access roads are split up as soon as
they enter the neighbourhood, keeping
the car traffic volume within the neighbourhood low and therefore compatible

increase in NMT use, enhancing urban landscape
aesthetics and boosting the social function of public
spaces.39
In general, with competition for space, speed and
infrastructure, cyclists and pedestrians are disadvantaged in most cities globally. Although NMT sustains
and complements public transport as a key feeder
service, it is seldom integrated with it and receives
rare media coverage.40 In the absence of strong
policy support for NMT, the requisite infrastructure
is not created, resulting in a more hostile environment with higher rates of fatal accidents and an
overall decline in cycling. This downward trend is
enhanced by the fact that most NMT users, at least
in developing countries, use NMT due to the lack of
affordable alternatives; they are captive low-income
users. There is thus a social stigma against using NMT
as it is seen as the travel mode of the poor.

Impacts of non-motorized transport
The use of NMT in cities generates numerous social,
economic and environmental benefits (Table 2.1).41
Indeed, the existing evidence has consistently shown

Table 2.1

transport benefits

that the benefits of expanding NMT use outweigh
the related costs by large margins. For instance, in
Amsterdam (the Netherlands) the overall benefit–cost
ratio of improving bicycle infrastructure was estimated to be 1.5:1 while similar calculations for Delhi
(India) and Bogotá (Colombia) estimated the ratio to
be 20:1 and 7:1, respectively.42
A major advantage of NMT is that it reduces
energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and
pollution (air, water and noise) substantially, as it does
not rely on fossil fuels unlike other modes of transport in cities (see Chapter 7). Furthermore, as NMT
requires significantly less road space and parking, it
enables the preservation of natural habitats and open
spaces. Cycling and walking can also directly provide
the daily physical activity required for a healthy
lifestyle. Negative health impacts have been observed
where the share of NMT in urban areas is encroached
by motorization.
Importantly also, the movement of passengers
through NMT supports urban livelihoods in developing-country cities. For instance, 20 per cent of the
population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, rely on rickshaw
pulling for their livelihood,43 while figures of 5–10 per
cent have been reported in the Indian cities of Kolkata,
Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad. This source of livelihood is particularly important in smaller cities with
limited public transport services and narrow streets.
Yet, despite generating enormous benefits in
cities, NMT is constrained in a number of ways.
Perhaps most critical is the risk of injury, with pedestrians and cyclists constituting more than 27 per cent
of those killed in road traffic accidents globally, rising
to a third in low- and middle-income countries.44
Globally, 400,000 pedestrians are killed annually and
vulnerability is accentuated in specific regions such
as Africa where 38 per cent of those killed in traffic
accidents are pedestrians.45
NMT faces the added challenge of being
marginalized in urban planning and investments,
partly due to an absence of adequate information and
data. External loan financing in many developing
countries tends to favour large projects, metro
systems and BRT systems. Data on NMT are also often
under-presented in transport data, resulting in low

planning priority given the reliance of policy-making
on mobility data.46 Pedestrians and cyclists may thus
be easily overlooked in planning at the expense of
motorized transport.
Related to the above, the negative public image
of NMT, especially in developing countries, is an
additional factor in its neglect in planning.47 Among
users themselves the stigma of poverty leads many
to shift to motorized transport when their incomes
rise. For authorities, development and modernity is
associated with technology and motorized transport.
Promotion of NMT may thus not be considered
commensurate with development.

FORMAL PUBLIC
TRANSPORT
This section reviews the trends and conditions of
public transport globally. The discussion focuses on
services which can be considered as formal according
to the way they are organized or operated to maintain
a level of service, quality, routes, timetables and fare
structures. High-capacity public transport services
by bus or rail – which has significant potential to
enhance urban accessibility in developed and developing countries alike – are examined in greater detail
in Chapter 3, while informal transport is reviewed
separately later in this chapter.
Overall, the growth of public transport in some
cities of developed countries and stagnation and
decline in cities of developing countries is highlighted, noting the consequences of restricted financial investments. The environmental, social and
economic benefits of public transport are outlined,
while the desirability of attracting choice riders to
public transport is discussed together with experiences and challenges of achieving this.

Developing countries
The modal share of public transport has decreased
or stagnated in most developing-country cities, and
few efficient formal public transport systems remain.
Public transport is typically operated by a growing
number of entrepreneurial individuals or small/
medium-sized companies, but with low investment
and minimal public support. Public transport in these
cites has been characterized by weak regulation,
scarcity in supply, poor quality and the predominance
of informal sector operators. Subsequent formalization occasionally occurs through aid-financing
arrangements, for instance through trust funds
guaranteeing credit lines for vehicle purchase, as in
Dakar (Senegal), Johannesburg (South Africa) and
Lagos (Nigeria).48
Some encouraging trends have, however, been
observed. In Africa, BRT systems have been intro-

duced in Lagos (Nigeria) and Johannesburg (South
Africa), generating substantial benefits for residents.49
BRT lines are under construction or planned in other
African cities such as Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Accra
(Ghana) and Kampala (Uganda). The supply of public
transport services is also increasing in North Africa,
with light rail and tram systems available in Cairo,
Casablanca, Rabat, Algiers and Tunis. Metro systems
are now servicing the population in Cairo (Egypt) and
Dubai (United Arab Emirates).50 Perhaps most notable are China’s growing investments in metro and
BRT systems, servicing millions of passengers in
urban areas.
Latin America has relatively good formalized
public transport with stronger institutions in planning and management, while the private sector plays
an increasingly important role in cities such as
Montevideo (Uruguay), Bogotá (Colombia) and Rio
de Janeiro (Brazil). A growing number of urban BRT
systems in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela
have expanded public transport services significantly.
Beyond mainstream formal public transport
services, a number of other modes exist in developing-country cities, depending on the context-specific
nature of transport challenges and opportunities.
Waterborne transport also serves a number of
cities in developing countries. In Mombasa (Kenya),
the Likoni ferry crossing serves over 200,000 passengers and 3500 vehicles daily.51 The Chao Phraya
express-boat company in Bangkok (Thailand) transports 11 million passengers annually.52 In Colombia,
Medellin’s aerial cable car (Metrocables) moves up
to 3000 passengers per hour and has been hailed
as an innovative and high-impact solution that has
dramatically transformed access to public transport
for inhabitants of informal settlements built on
steeply sloping terrain and hillsides.53

Developed countries
Most cities in developed countries are maintaining
or increasing the market share of formal public
transport. In North America and Western Europe,
the annual number of public transport passengers
has been increasing since the 1960s and 1970s,
despite rising car ownership and suburban sprawl.54
Yet, this overall increase masks differences between
and within cities (or countries), as well as the low
growth of public transport relative to other modes
of transport.
Levels of public transport use per capita range
from highs of 237 trips per person annually in Switzerland to only 24 trips per capita annually in the
US.55 Although North America’s public transport
ridership is slowly growing – especially light rail and
quality bus services in cities that have invested in
public transport (Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver
in Canada and Portland in the US)56 – the modal share
of public transport remains marginal in comparison

to European countries. A significant proportion of the
daily trips in European cities like Vienna (Austria) and
Helsinki (Finland) are by public transport, but far less
so in Melbourne (Australia) and Chicago (US) (Figure
2.5). The dramatic overall decline in the importance
of public transport in Australia since the first half of
the last decade has been attributed to increased
motorization (Figure 2.6).

especially for short inner-city trips, although constraints for women, children and the elderly have
been noted. In Vienna, Austria, for instance, 96 per

billion passengers annually.58 Tramway use is seeing
a revival in developed-country cities, especially in
France, Spain, Portugal and the UK, but also in North
America and Australia. Globally, the number of cities
with trams had risen to 400 in 2011(compared to
300 in 1980), and another 100 systems were under
construction or being planned.59 In Eastern European
countries the use of public transport remains much
higher than in the rest of Europe, despite the
debilitating effects of the end of communism on
public transport services and use. Nevertheless, the
dense urban rail and trolleybus systems created by
the centralized socialist economies have been largely
neglected and dilapidated amid rapid motorization
and urban sprawl.60
In terms of the regulatory aspects of public
transport provision, there has been a notable global
shift from publicly owned provision to a privately
owned market-driven approach since the 1980s

(Table 2.2). A separation of organizer, operator and
infrastructure functions has occurred such that public
authorities now oversee, rather than organize or
deliver, public transport. In the European Union
(EU) for instance, there has been a strong drive for
the deregulation of transport provision. One of the
earliest experiences, which would later influence the
rest of Europe, was the deregulation of the public
transport market in the UK,61 with private operators
now providing more than 80 per cent of bus services
outside London, leading to both improvements and
setbacks.62
Despite some notable achievements in the
expansion of public transport services, the wider
picture is fragmented, with disparity in provision
between regions and countries, and between capitals
and non-capital cities. There are limited statistics on
public transport operations in cities of developing
countries, making comparison difficult.

Infrastructure for public transport

Public transport systems significantly influence the
economic, environmental and social fabric of urban
life in positive ways, and form a key prerequisite for
the sustainable city of the twenty-first century. This
mode of transport moves more people with fewer
vehicles, less energy and smaller space consumption.
Notable among positive environmental impacts are
lower emissions of airborne pollutants and greenhouse gases (see Chapter 7).
The economic benefits of public transport
investment include both direct job creation and
indirect support of manufacturing, construction and
other economic activities. An investment of US$1
billion in public transportation supports 36,000 local
jobs in the US.72 People living near public transport services work more days annually than those
without such access, while public transport com-

In most
developing
countries, urban
public transport
infrastructure is
far from adequate
and in poor
condition

Globally, there has been a lack of adequate investment in public transport.63 In most developing countries, urban public transport infrastructure is far
from adequate and in poor condition.64 The existing
infrastructure is often derelict and poorly maintained, which in turn compromises not only the
quality of service, but also the health and safety of
passengers. Previously subsidized public transport
services have also been scaled back or discontinued
amid policies of liberalization and economic reform
in some developing countries. In Africa, publicly
owned and managed public transport entities were
disbanded in the 1990s owing largely to structural
adjustment policies, leading to years of neglect since
then and the dominance of informal transport
operations.65
Investments required for urban public transport services can be prohibitively high for developing countries, as in the case of rail-based transport
that costs millions of dollars per kilometre.66 Furthermore, the spending on roads for private motorized
transport remains far higher than on dedicated public
transport infrastructure in developing countries (see
for example the case of Africa in Figure 2.7). Much
of the overseas development assistance received by
developing countries has focused on road building,
although this approach is now slowly changing in
favour of investments in more socially sustainable
modes.
The provision of public transport infrastructure
is comparatively better in cities in some key emerging
markets, such as South Africa and Brazil (Figure
2.8). The increased availability of bus transport
services in most metropolitan areas of India – as a
result of measures taken under the Jawaharlal Nehru
National Urban Renewal Mission – has been noted,

but the services remain unreliable, time-consuming
and overcrowded.67 The hosting of international
events has also driven major public transport
investments in cities such as Johannesburg (World
Cup, 2010), Beijing (Olympics, 2008), Shanghai
(World Expo, 2010), Delhi (Commonwealth Games,
2010) and Rio de Janeiro (World Cup, 2014).68
In contrast, many cities of developed countries
have seen investment and improving services,69
increasingly through public–private partnerships.
During the 1990s average investment remained at
0.45–0.5 per cent of urban area GDP, with the
higher levels in Madrid (Spain), Lisbon (Portugal),
London (UK), Berlin (Germany), Vienna (Austria),
Oslo (Norway), Prague (Czech Republic) and Lille
(France).70 Investment was also sustained in highincome Asian countries, particularly in Singapore,
Tokyo (Japan) and Hong Kong (China).71

muters often report that they would not continue
in current jobs, or would earn less, without public
transport services.73 A UK Government study showed
that 13 per cent of respondents had not applied for
a particular job in the previous 12 months due to
transport problems.74 Furthermore, the economic
benefit of a modal shift to public transport can be
substantial. In the US, it has been estimated that the
annual economic savings to consumers would exceed
the cost of strategies to encourage such a shift by
approximately US$112 billion.75
Public transport investments via subsidies can
have a broad effect. Subsidized student and schoolchild use (e.g. low-priced student tickets in Western
Europe) can provide guaranteed revenues on
uneconomic routes, as in the case of Germany.76 In
the US, many universities provide reduced-fare
tickets. Salt Lake City’s TRAX light rail system in this
way serves the University of Utah with 45,000
travellers a week, or 33 per cent of total travel to
the campus.77
In social terms, access to jobs, education, health
services and other facilities is increased by public
transport provision; these are central to social
inclusion for the disadvantaged. Furthermore, public
transportation also supports community cohesion by
increasing the quantity and quality of interactions
between people.78 For the youth, public transport
offers a means of travelling independently, and in
some cases this can delay the desire (or need) to drive
private motorized vehicles.
Public transport tends to increase physical
activity as most trips include walking or cycling
links.79 Users average about three times as much
walking as people who rely on private cars, nearly
achieving the 22 daily minutes of moderate physical
activity considered necessary for health reasons.80
Public transport passengers also have about onetenth the fatality rate of car occupants and, in terms
of risks to other road users, public transport causes

less than half the number of deaths per passengerkilometre compared to private cars.81
The limited availability of financial resources for
the provision of public transport services is a key
constraint. Often, only a fraction of the necessary
improvements can be implemented from the public
purse. This has ramifications for both service levels
and quality. Under such circumstances, retaining
existing public transport customers, while gaining
new ones, becomes particularly difficult. Projections
on future population growth and motorized travel
amid a lack of road capacity, suggest that if public
transport does not double its modal share, many cities
may well grind to a halt.
The challenge is to convert congestion into
public transport riders, and overcome dependency
on private cars. Yet, an important precursor to
increasing such ridership is the provision of highquality services, as clients value aspects such as
connectivity and coordination of services, while
flexibility and trip-chaining is also important, particularly for women.82 Qualitative factors such as convenience, comfort, security and prestige are valued
more highly than is assumed by a conventional focus
on quantitative factors such as speed and price.83
Focusing investments on improving quality of services
may thus be even more effective than eliminating
public transport fares (Box 2.3).
Security and safety concerns are a barrier for
public transport use by children, women and the
elderly (see Chapter 6). overcrowding can expose
travellers to undesirable behaviour in fellow passengers, and some cities do offer segregation of services
such as in Mexico City (Mexico), Tehran (Iran) and
Dubai (United Arab Emirates), where there are
designated women’s areas on public transport. Also,
although children and youth are high user groups,
keeping these as choice riders as they get older is
not easy if public transport is low quality and
perceived as old fashioned.84

Box 2.3 Zero-fare public transport?
Would zero-fare public transport
systems ‘even the playing field’ and
encourage travellers to shift from cars
to public transport? Would free public
transport be good for society,
particularly lower-income or disadvantaged people?
Concession fares are an example
of addressing these social objectives
through partial subsidy. In a zero-fare
public transport system the entire cost
of the system is subsidized. The passenger does not directly pay for the trip,
the most obvious result being that
people are more likely to use public
transport, as has been the case in
Hasselt, a small city in Belgium. a similar

Estonia, zero-fare public transport for all
its 420,000 inhabitants on all public
transport services run by the city from 1
January 2013 is expected to significantly
increase ridership.
However, meeting dramatically
increased demand in large systems
would require considerable capital
investment. If funds were instead used
to increase service levels, perhaps new
passengers may be attracted while
maintaining income from existing
passengers. The income from new
passengers may then at least partially
offset the costs of the improved service.

The value of expanding public transport services
to enhance accessible mobility in cities is unquestionable. Urban planning and land-use policies –
together with transport demand and fiscal measures
– can encourage a shift in transport behaviour
towards public transport. Authorities in many cities
may, however, lack the resources and institutional
capacity necessary to coordinate land-use and transport planning so that they generate such a modal
transition.

INFORMAL TRANSPORT
The informal sector – a term describing small-scale
economic activity and unregulated employment –
supplies small-vehicle, low-performance services
that fill the niche between formal taxis and conventional 50-passenger capacity buses.85 This section
examines the conditions of informal transport
globally, illustrating the dominance of this mode in
developing countries. Informal transport is often the
only accessible means available in many of the world’s
poorest cities. Although it provides important benefits
to the urban poor, informal transport contributes
significantly to congestion, air and noise pollution and
traffic accidents. The role of informal transport in
complementing formal transport and in generating
broader social benefit is considered together with the
costs entailed.

Developing countries
Informal transport is firmly entrenched in developing-country cities, often accounting for over half

of all motorized trips. In Africa, private carriers
dominate, mainly minibuses and shared taxis with
schedules and fares varying with demand, routes
being semi-fixed and stopping points unregulated.
The City of Nairobi (Kenya) has the world’s highest
per capita use of informal transport with matatu minibuses providing 662 trips per inhabitant per year,
three-quarters of public transport trips and 36 per
cent of traffic volumes. In Harare, Zimbabwe, minibuses serve around 90 per cent of the market.86 In
Algiers (Algeria) the modal share for taxis and minibuses is 56 per cent of motorized trips,87 while in
Greater Cairo, Egypt, informal shared taxis increased
their modal share (of motorized trips) from 6 per cent
in 1987 to 37 per cent in 2001, and this has since
risen even higher.88
In Lagos (Nigeria) the public-sector bus company
failed under the weight of low fares and unsustainable subsidies, its mobility role taken over by danfos,
midi-buses providing frequent and affordable services,
but characterized by overcrowding and aggressive
driving.89 A fast growing informal mode is motorcycle taxis, with 60,000 of them in Cotonou (Benin)
accounting for one-quarter of all trips.90 In Kampala,
Uganda, residents resort to boda boda motorcycle
taxis, despite fares being four to six times higher than
regular taxis.91 The lower investments required from
operators of informal transport services are a key
incentive for entry into this sector.
Formal public transport is often absent in many
Asian cities. In Istanbul, Turkey, an estimated 5000
illegal taxis were in operation by the year 2000.92 In
Sana’a, Yemen, public transport is almost entirely
reliant on informally operated vehicles, often old and
poorly maintained, posing safety, health and congestion challenges for the city.93 Minibuses and microbuses serve 5–10 per cent of all trips in Thailand and
Indonesia. Informal vehicles, dominated by the
colourful jeepneys (converted US army jeeps) provide
as many as half of all trips in the Philippines.94 While
NMT serves short-distance trips in Jakarta, Indonesia,
motorcycle taxis (ojeks) cover longer distances.
Hybrid, three-wheeled motor-taxis, bajas, provide
comfort more akin to a private car, while larger
three-wheeled bemos carry up to eight passengers,
and mikrolets and minibuses carry 10 to 25 passengers.95 The rapid expansion in auto-rickshaws has
been observed in numerous Asian and African cities
in recent years (Box 2.4).
Informal transport is a predominant mode in
most of Latin America, with the proliferation of vans
and minibuses fuelled by a lowering of import tariffs
and the inability of public transport to meet transport demand. A flood of 10 to 15 passenger vans in
the 1990s displaced pirate buses in Rio de Janeiro,
while today an estimated 15,000 unlicensed vans
operate in São Paulo.96 The use of unlicensed vans
in Brazil is also tied to perceived arduous and overreaching registration procedures. In Santiago, Chile,

Box 2.4 Auto-rickshaws: Taxis for the poor and middle class
An auto-rickshaw or three-wheeler (variously known as tuktuk, trishaw, autorick, chakda, vikram, tempo, bajaj, tricycle, baby
taxi, etc.) is a popular way to get around in many developing
countries. These motorized versions of the traditional
rickshaw flourish in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Ethiopia,
Guatemala, India, Laos, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka,
Sudan and Thailand. In many Indian and Pakistani cities,
motorcycle rickshaws – usually called phat-phati, chand gari
(moon car) or qingqi (after the Chinese company) – also
populate city streets. In Afghanistan, auto-rickshaw use is

some 30,000 pirate taxis ply the streets. In Kingston,
Jamaica, private station-wagons (called robots) poach
customers from public operators by running ahead
of buses.97 In Mexico City, around half of the minibus operators are not legitimately licensed or insured.
Smaller door-to-door carriers concentrate on outlying markets, such as in Bogotá, Colombia, where
tricimobiles in peripheral informal settlements serve
short trips of 1–2 kilometres at low costs (less than
US$0.50 per trip).98 Because of rapid motorization,
however, informal carriers are increasingly viewed
as major contributors to worsening traffic congestion.
Informal transport operators in developing
countries serve not only low-income markets but
also middle-income choice consumers looking for
convenience (e.g. door-to-door, taxi-like services).99
Low-income users also seek service quality, as in the
case of Uzbekistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Brazilian
cities where surveys show that the poor are willing
to pay more for better services.100 Furthermore,
there are notable gender and age differences in the
use of informal transport in cities, with minibuses
catering to larger volume, longer distance trips,
generally serving male customers. Motorcycle taxis
often cater to a younger crowd. Nearly two-thirds of
the motorcycle-taxi passengers in Bangkok, Thailand,
are aged 16–25 years.101
Generally, the role of informal transport appears
to decline as cities in developing countries become
wealthier. For instance, the market share of informal

growing at 10 to 20 per cent per year in many cities. Autorickshaws are also an important source of employment,
providing as much as 15 per cent of total urban jobs in some
Asian cities.
Because two-stroke engines that power most autorickshaws are noisy and emit high levels of air emissions, local
governments in India and Pakistan have in recent years
required that older models be replaced by cleaner and quieter
three-wheelers, powered by compressed natural gas.
Sources: Cervero, 2000; Jain, 2011.

transport in nine cities in Sub-Saharan Africa shows
a negative correlation with local GDP per capita
levels (Figure 2.9). This inverse relationship between
wealth and informal transport can at times prompt
public authorities to ban them in the hope of
conveying a modern image.
Informal transport services are nowhere near as
vertically organized as formal services. Often,
individual owner-operators provide the service, and
the sector is normally held together in a loose
horizontal fashion, dependent upon inter-personal
and inter-operator linkages and fellowship among
stakeholders (Box 2.5).
Some developing countries attempt to regulate
market entry, vehicle and driver fitness and service
practices with respect to informal transport. For
example, in Nairobi, Kenya, the Ministry of Transport
enforced that all seats be fitted with seatbelts in
minibuses, while standing is no longer permitted on
larger buses.102 Red plates distinguish the 55,000
legitimate shared-ride taxis of Beirut, Lebanon,
although around 40 per cent of the plates are
forged.103 However, circumvention of such regulations is widespread and enforcement is often hampered. Thus, in many poorer countries, governments acquiesce to self-regulation and self-policing
of informal transport. Indeed, many informal operators often form route associations to minimize
collectively damaging behaviour and to increase
ridership and profits.

Box 2.5 Minibus operators in Kampala (Uganda) and Nairobi (Kenya)
In Kampala and Nairobi, it is normal for minibus owners to be
investors rather than owner-drivers. Most owners have less
than four vehicles. They usually hire out their minibuses for a
daily fee to a principal driver, who may in turn employ a
second driver and one or more conductors. The driver keeps
the revenue collected but is responsible for paying the costs of
fuel, use of the minibus terminals, the wages of any second
driver and conductors, as well as any fines extorted from him
by the police or the route associations. Drivers work very

long hours, with shifts averaging more than 12 hours a day,
usually for six or seven days a week, although actual driving
hours are normally seven to eight hours. So as to maximize
the revenue from each trip, the minibus driver will not
normally leave the terminal until the vehicle is full. This means

Deliberate re-regulation of public transport has
also been observed in some developing countries.
Responding to faltering public bus services, the local
government of Kingston, Jamaica, opened the marketplace to private service providers in the 1990s, only
to experience a deluge of illegal minibus operators
who flagrantly violated traffic rules. A single government-controlled bus company was consequently
reintroduced, although illegal minibuses still persist.
In Dakar, Senegal, re-regulation similarly followed
the declining quality of private paratransit services.
With the help of overseas development assistance,
an organizing authority was created and resourced
to upgrade the minibus fleet and grant tightly
controlled concessions to private companies. In
Nairobi, Kenya, matatu minibuses are being phased
out in the central business district in favour of larger
vehicles (25 seats and more), operated by larger, more
closely regulated owner-driver ‘societies’.

Developed countries
Many cities of developed countries also have informal
transport services, often as niche markets for
immigrants from countries with a legacy of informal
transport. Some car-owning lower income families
also supplement their income by operating ‘under
the radar’.104 Unlicensed illegal limousine services

may poach unsuspecting visitors leaving airports. In
Miami and New York (US), informal services thrive
as trusted and familiar alternatives to city services,
particularly in areas with dense neighbourhoods of
people with similar cultural backgrounds, high
levels of immigrants and non-native speakers. Over
5000 illegal vans and private cars are estimated to
roam the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn.105
Other examples include the ‘black cabs’ of Belfast
(UK) and the ‘little Cuba cabs’ of Miami (US) operating in low-income neighbourhoods ignored and
sometimes redlined by authorized operators.
In Eastern Europe, informal transport began to
play an increasingly important role in the 1990s,
following the disbanding and weakening of state-run
public transport enterprises. For instance, in Tirana,
Albania, ten-seat minivans called furgons emerged
as a key form of transport in 1999, even surpassing
the service of formal buses on some inner-city
routes. Despite being banned from the inner city,
such transport continues to play a major role in the
metropolitan region of Tirana, accounting for 14 per
cent of all trips.106

transport is limited or non-existent – it is often the
only dependable service available. With fewer passengers per vehicle, paratransit is more frequent, thereby
reducing waiting times and is also more flexible and
adaptive by providing door-to-door service. Small
vehicles are suited to lower density settings, serving
polycentric trip patterns, functioning as complements to large-vehicle, trunk-line services. They also
penetrate the narrow streets of low-cost neighbourhoods and better negotiate congested traffic, and are
thus faster, often offering a smoother ride and a
guaranteed seat. Vehicles used for informal transport
can also be more energy efficient, owing to higher
load factors. In Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, minibuses use
an average of 12 per cent less fuel per passenger trip
compared to conventional buses.107
The greatest appeal of paratransit is that it is
financially remunerative. Driven by profit, operators
respond quickly to market trends and economize
on costs. By organizing into route associations
and cooperatives they can lower per-seat costs to the
point of being competitive with larger companies.108
Data from minibus operations in Abidjan (Côte
d’Ivoire), Dakar (Senegal) and Douala (Cameroon)
reveal sizeable profit margins, fare-box revenues
exceeding operating costs by 17–96 per cent.109 In
Johannesburg (South Africa), the operating cost per
passenger of formal public transport is estimated to
be 13 times higher than informal transport.110
Importantly also, the informal sector is a
significant gateway employment for many recent
immigrants, making up an estimated 15 per cent
of total employment in poor countries. In Dhaka,
Bangladesh, the figure is close to 30 per cent.111 In
Cotonou, Benin (with just under 1 million inhabitants), motorcycle taxis alone provide 60,000 jobs,
mostly for young men.112 Indirect employment is also
significant, as touts, changers (who provide small
change) and a cadre of individuals who clean, maintain, repair and rebuild informal carriers.113 Most
motorcycle taxi operators in Bangkok (Thailand),
Jakarta (Indonesia) and Yola (Nigeria) are rural
migrants with no previous urban employment.114
While playing a critical role for the mobility of
many urban residents, the informal transport sector
faces a number of constraints.115 A key challenge
faced by operators relates to accessing commercial
lines of credit. In the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan
Africa, banks are reluctant to lend to informal
operators. If they do, interest rates are often high
(40 per cent or more per month) and payback periods
short (three years or less). Unable to obtain credit
through formal channels, some operators turn to
street lenders, paying most of their daily earnings to
creditors and rarely getting out of debt. Operators
that lease vehicles pay to vehicle owners, often half
or more of their daily in-take, meaning few are able
to break out of poverty.116

Safety is an additional challenge, with accidents
occurring because of poor (or lack of) driver training, inappropriate vehicles and poor maintenance.
In Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, minibuses (ghakas) are
involved in around 10 per cent of accidents and
shared taxis in 25 per cent. In Yopougon, Côte
d’Ivoire, shared taxis account for an estimated 90 per
cent of traffic accidents and nearly all associated
deaths in these accidents.117 In South Africa, more
than 2000 drivers, attendants and passengers died
in paratransit-related violence during the 1990s,
according to official statistics.118 Informal operators
rarely insure vehicles (or passengers), thus further
aggravating accident impacts.
In environmental terms, paratransit vehicles are
significant atmospheric polluters due to two-stroke
engines, excessive oil mixtures, low-grade fuels
and poorly maintained engines.119 In Cambodia and
Laos, tuk-tuk three-wheelers still rely on two-stroke
engines. In Thailand, most two-stroke engines have
been converted to less noisy and polluting fourstroke engines, some cities experimenting with solar
panel propulsion.120 In much of Sub-Saharan Africa,
motorcycle taxis emit from both two-stroke engines
and excessive use of oil lubricant in fuels.
Without formal oversight, discrimination and
harassment can be experienced by informal transport
users. In Malawi and South Africa, women report fear
of rape and high levels of verbal abuse.121 Expectations that women sit side-saddle on motorcycle taxis
can pose serious safety risks (Box 2.6). In the Middle
East, cultural restrictions on haggling with male
drivers means women often pay higher fares. Minibus routes focusing on work connections rather
than domestic journeys – along with paying at each
mode change – mean that Middle Eastern women
pay more than men.122 Young patrons are also vulnerable. In Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), some dala dala minibuses do not allow children to board during rush
hours because government concessionary fares are
seen as unprofitable.123
Corruption is frequently rife within the informal
transport sector. Since most service providers are not
fully licensed they must often pay bribes. In Dakar,
Senegal, bribes to police officers by minibus drivers
comprise 5 per cent of total operating costs.124 In
Thailand, Bangkok’s win motorcycle taxi operators
complain of protection payments to police officials
and military officers.
Another consequence of weak regulatory control
is abuse of the labour market, seen through a disregard for minimum salaries, age limits, work-hour
restrictions and insufficient or absent insurance, etc.
Informal workers have few other employment options
and are often in debt to vehicle owners who set high
rents or provide high-interest loans.

Box 2.6 Gender differences in Nigerian motorcycle taxis
The worldwide economic recession and market liberalization
policies from the 1990s have weakened an already struggling
public transport sector across Nigerian cities. Buses routinely
broke down, roads remained rutted and in very poor
condition and formal services never reached the rapidly
growing informal settlements on the urban fringes. Informal
motorcycle and tricycle auto-rickshaw operators stepped in to
fill the gap.
While viewed as just temporary fixes in the minds of
public authorities, slowly but surely they have become firmly
established as the backbone of Nigeria’s urban public transport
system. Flexible and market-responsive yet still too expensive
for the poor, they predominantly serve more educated,
somewhat better-off residents. A recent study of four
intermediate-sized Nigerian cities showed that 85 per cent of
such motorcycle passengers used the services four or more
times a week, with slightly more women than men relying on
such transport on a daily basis.

The growth of private motorized transport during the
twentieth century had major impacts on the growth
and development of cities all over the world. Pathways
once charted in developed countries are now being
followed in the rapidly growing cities of developing
countries. This section reviews the global conditions
and trends in the use of private motorized vehicles,
and in the provision of infrastructure for the same.
The externalities associated with private motor
vehicles are considered while examining the advantages of private motorization.
In 2010, there were 825 million passenger cars
globally. Of these, close to 70 per cent were in

Over 95 per cent of the women surveyed stated that
they adjusted their dress accordingly, compared to only 22 per
cent of the men. Moreover, 83 per cent of the men were
single passengers compared to only 8 per cent of the women,
who frequently travelled with their infants and toddlers.
Motorcycle fatalities have sharply risen across all cities in West
Africa, including Nigeria. Records show that a higher number
of females than male passengers were involved in three or
more accidents per year. Dress and social norms have played a
role in this; as women are expected to sit with two legs placed
to the left of the motorcycle, which exposes them directly to
traffic and a risk of being thrown off at bends or roundabouts.
Children are equally vulnerable where they travel with women
under such circumstances.

developed (including transitional) countries while
only 30 per cent were in developing countries,
mainly in Asia (Table 2.3). The number of light-duty
motor vehicles – cars, SUVs, light trucks and minivans – is projected to increase to nearly 1.6 billion
by 2035125 and more than 2.1 billion by 2050 (Figure
2.10). Africa had the lowest ownership rates, accounting for only 3 per cent of all passenger cars globally.
Nevertheless, motorization growth rates are higher
in developing countries, as discussed below.
Globally, the number of new cars sold annually
increased from 39 million in the 1990s to nearly
63 million in 2012.126 Asia has seen a steady rise in
new-car sales figures, from around 7 million in the
1990s to around 25 million in 2012, thereby becoming the leader in new-car sales, accounting for 40

per cent of global sales in 2012 (Figure 2.11). The
rapidly growing economies of Asia and South America
are expected to continue driving massive future
growth in new-car sales. It should here be noted that
in many developing countries the bulk of newly
registered cars are not new, but rather second-hand
imports from developed countries.127 Statistics on
new-car sales are thus an unreliable basis for discussions on motorization levels in these countries.

Developed countries
Car ownership began to emerge as a phenomenon
in the early twentieth century in the US, becoming
widely available to the middle classes after 1920,
and by the 1950s car ownership levels had reached
an average of one car per household.128 This was
to have a significant influence on the spatial form of
cities, allowing urban sprawl and facilitating the
expansion of low-density suburban settlements in
much of North America.129 Within the framework of
a government drive to provide affordable housing,
land-use dispersal became a prominent feature of
urbanization in the US, accompanied by growing car
dependence.130 Increased motorization occurred
in other developed countries much later, but given
higher population densities in Europe and Japan,

public transport continued to play an important role.
Indeed, both distances travelled and the number of
trips by private car per capita are substantially lower
in European countries compared to the US.131
Since 1990, vehicle ownership growth rates
have been declining in a number of European
countries such as Germany, France, Italy and also in
Japan.132 A non-linear relationship has been found
between the growth of vehicle ownership and per
capita income such that vehicle ownership grows
slowly at lower levels of per capita income, then faster
at middle and higher income levels reaching saturation at the highest levels of income.133 In countries
with high car ownership there is evidence that travel
distances may have peaked, so that further increases
in GDP are unlikely to lead to increased travel
distances (Figure 2.12).134 Factors such as higher fuel
prices, an ageing population, improved travel options
and health and environmental concerns contribute
to a growing demand for alternative modes of travel
in developed countries.135
In countries with economies in transition –
following the move away from socialism and
related market liberalization – car ownership rates
doubled in just a decade (1990–2000). At the same
time, these countries have experienced declining use
of public transport, particularly due to the removal

of state subsidies and disbanding of state-owned
operators. Not surprisingly also, suburban sprawl
patterns have emerged as prominent features in
former socialist countries, representing a departure
from the formerly densely built-up urban centres
dependent on public transport.136
Variations in distances travelled by motorized
vehicles in the US illustrate how specific urban forms
shape travel behaviour. In 2007, residents of lowdensity sprawling cities travelled longer distances,
as in the cases of Atlanta (48 vehicle kilometres
per capita per day), Houston (61 kilometres) and
Jacksonville (54 kilometres); while those living in
more compact cities travel shorter distances, such
as in New York (27 kilometres) and New Orleans
(24 kilometres).137 The relationship between urban
form, land use patterns and private motorized travel
is elaborated in greater detail in Chapter 5 of this
report.

Developing countries
The rate of motor vehicle ownership in developing
countries remains significantly lower than in developed countries (Table 2.3). However, ownership
levels are not indicative of the high rates of growth
in motor vehicle ownership in developing countries.
The average annual motor vehicle ownership growth
rate in emerging economies is higher than that of
most developed countries. The levels of motorization
in rapidly emerging cities of developing countries are
already higher than expected, given their lower GDPs
and their generally dense urban form.138 With most
of the current and future growth in population and
urbanization taking place in developing countries, the

potential for further motorization is substantial.139
Motorized two-wheelers constitute a sizeable
proportion of motor vehicles in developing countries, particularly in Asia where 75 per cent of the
world’s two-wheelers are located, out of which China
and India account for 50 per cent and 20 per cent,
respectively.140 It has been estimated that there
were some 350 million two- and three-wheelers in
use worldwide in 2005 (Figure 2.10). However,
in many countries, this is the fastest increasing segment of personal transport. A recent report projects
that total sales of motorcycles in 2013 alone may
reach 114 million units, up from 39 million in 2003
and 79 million in 2008. The bulk of these, some 80
per cent are sold in Asian countries (55 per cent in
China alone), yet the fastest rates of increase in sales
are reported from Africa and the Middle East.141
Thus, by 2050, the global stock of motorized twoand three-wheelers is projected to reach about 850
million (Figure 2.10). Therefore, while the rate of
car ownership in many developing countries in Asia
may be low (Table 2.3), the rate of motorization may
be much higher. In cities such as Ho Chi Minh City
(Viet Nam), Jakarta (Indonesia), Chennai and Mumbai
(India) and Guangzhou and Shanghai (China) the
number of motorcycles per capita exceeds that of
cars (Figure 2.13). The inclusion of two- and threewheelers dramatically alters motorization levels in
Asian countries, raising them to levels comparable
to developed countries.142
The rapid and often unmanageable growth in
the number of two- and three-wheelers has resulted
in the introduction of a number of government measures to restrict their growth and operation in Asian
cities (Table 2.4). Even so – given their affordability,

fuel economy and manoeuvrability relative to private
cars, and amid restricted access to public transport
– two- and three-wheelers are likely to remain a
popular option for lower and middle-income residents
of Asian cities. In contrast, in Latin America and
Africa, the number of motorcycles relative to cars
remains low. Although ownership rates for two- and
three-wheelers, are currently quite low in African
cities, their role is expected to increase in the
future.143

Infrastructure for private motorized
transport
Globally, the provision of road space and parking for
vehicles varies considerably, partly reflecting different
strategies adopted by cities towards private motorized travel (Table 2.5). In most cities of Africa and
Asia, there is less than 1 metre of road per person.
Latin American cities, such as Curitiba, Bogotá and
São Paulo have slightly more road length per person.
Even so, road lengths per person in developingcountry cities remain far lower than the average of
the US (6.5 metres per person) and Australia (8.1
metres per person). A key objective of urban transport investments in many developing countries has
thus been to increase road space for motorized
transport. Yet, new road infrastructure tends to
generate additional traffic. There is a need to move

away from simply predicting growth in motorization
in order to provide additional infrastructure, and
move towards demand management within the
framework of an overall strategy for sustainability.
With respect to parking space, cities such as
Bogotá (Colombia), Chennai (India) and Shanghai
(China) have less than ten parking spots for every
1000 jobs in their central business district areas.
In contrast, other cities such as Kuala Lumpur
(Malaysia), Bangkok (Thailand) and Harare (Zimbabwe) have central business district parking spots
in relation to jobs comparable to those of richer
cities in Canada and Western Europe. The extremes
are China at the low end and Riyadh (Saudi Arabia)
at the top end with more parking places than jobs
(Table 2.5).
The availability of parking is critical for
destination accessibility and thus an important
determinant of modal choice in urban areas. Control
over available spaces, the length of availability and
the costs of parking can thus prove effective in
restricting private motor vehicle use if incorporated
in the overall city-wide transport strategy.144
Complementary traffic enforcement policies may be
needed to ensure informal parking does not take
place.145
In developed countries too the provision of
road space is differentiated (Table 2.5). The highest
levels of road space per capita can be found in cities

in Australia, New Zealand, the US and Canada, all of
which have more than 5 metres of road per person.
Western Europe has an average of 3 metres of
roads per person, while Eastern European countries
have even less. The availability of parking spots is also
much lower in Eastern Europe compared to other
developed countries. The length of freeways per
person in Western Europe is almost triple that of
Eastern Europe. On the whole, provision of infrastructure for private motorized transport is lower
in Europe when compared to North America and
Australia, both in terms of road length, freeway
length and availability of parking spaces.

Impacts of private motorized transport
The major element behind the growth of private
motorized transport around the world has been the
individual freedom it offers, at a cost that is becoming
affordable for a growing number of people. The
perceived advantages of convenience, privacy and
status continue to make the private car an attractive
means of transport in cities. Moreover, the private
motorized transport industry generates numerous
economic benefits, including direct employment in
manufacturing, indirect employment in infrastructure and services (fuel stations, maintenance, secondhand markets, policing, emergency services) and
major investments in urban areas (road construction).

Overall, the automotive industry supports around
5 per cent of the total global workforce.146 However,
a considerable range of externalities arise from
increased motorization in cities. Taken together,
these dwarf the benefits of this means of transport.
Being heavily dependent on oil, one of the most
significant impacts of private motorized transport is
on the environment. Increased use of private
motorized transport also has impacts on health and
safety in cities.147
A further externality of private motorized transport is traffic congestion that imposes significant costs
on economic efficiency as time lost due to congestion
reduces productivity. Congestion costs in Canada
are as high as US$4.5 billion148 nationally of which
80 per cent is accounted for by the country’s three
largest urban regions: Greater Toronto (43 per cent),
Montreal (21 per cent) and Vancouver (17 per
cent).149 In the US, congestion has led urban Americans to travel 5.5 billion hours more and to purchase
an extra 11 billion litres of fuel for congestionrelated costs of US$121 billion in 2011.150 In 2005,
the cost of congestion in Australia’s eight capital
cities was US$7.1 billion,151 comprised of private time
costs (37 per cent), business time costs (38 per cent),
extra vehicle operating costs (13 per cent) and extra
air population (12 per cent).152 The immense economic impact of traffic congestion is further illustrated by the case of Cairo, which costs Egypt as much
as 4 per cent of its GDP.153 In São Paulo, Brazil, some
of the wealthiest residents have resorted to the
regular use of helicopters to beat traffic jams.154
Access to motorized transport has not been
universal in cities, with gender, age, disability and
income having an impact. Also, in developing countries, travel by private motorized transport is reserved
for a small group of high-income (often male) earners,
and so its importance for women is comparatively
minor.155 However, this is changing, particularly
in emerging economies such as China, India and
Brazil, where middle-class women are increasingly
owning and driving cars. The number of female
drivers in Russia, where car ownership functions as
an important status symbol, has increased by 50 per
cent from 2000 to 2006.156 Similar trends have been
observed in Mumbai, India, where (with women
earning higher incomes) traditional male-dominated
gender roles in car purchase decisions are changing.157 Gender differences in access to motorized
transport in turn translate into differentiated access
to opportunities.

INTERMODALITY IN URBAN
TRANSPORT
The four modes of urban transport discussed in this
chapter are highly complementary in that urban

trips are often multi-modal, involving a combination
of more than one mode. Modal integration – or the
coordination of transport infrastructure, services,
facilities and spatial configuration to enable seamless
links between at least two different modes, thereby
facilitating trip-chaining – is an essential prerequisite
for enabling multi-modal trips, and by implication also
urban accessibility. Strategies that facilitate this
include spatial, network, fare, information and institutional integration to allow smooth transfers between
different modes of urban transport.158 It is particularly
important to facilitate easy transfers between other
modes and public transport if its modal share is to
increase.
The critical importance of intermodality to
enable accessibility in cities is recognized, though
interventions designed to enhance integration vary
across countries. Cities in Western Europe have
taken the lead in facilitating modal integration,
especially between public and non-motorized transport. Cycling significantly increases the catchment
area of public transport stops beyond walking range,
while access to public transport makes longer trips
possible for bicyclists.159 In Germany, 70 bike stations
located at train stations enable bicyclists and public
transport users to smoothly transition from one mode
to the other. In the city of Berlin alone 24,000 bike
parking spaces are available at public transport
stations.160 All metro and express interurban train
stations on the peripheries of the city now have bike
parking facilities. Guarded facilities for storing bikes
together with complementary services (maintenance
and repair) are available at all main train stations in
the Netherlands, where 35 per cent of train users
use a bike to get to and from train stations.161 In the
UK, train travellers are able to buy a discount bus
ticket (PLUSBUS) that enables seamless transfer to
buses.162
North American cities have, to some degree,
also witnessed an increase in facilities designed to
integrate cycling and public transport services, with
bike parking spaces increasing by 67 per cent in
Canada and 26 per cent in the US between
2006 and 2008. Noteworthy examples include the
San Francisco Bay Area – where the Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) system has bike parking in almost
all 43 stations – and Vancouver – where integration
between public transport and bicycles is facilitated
by TransLink. TransLink, Vancouver’s multi-modal
transportation authority, has spent more than US$12
million on such integration between 1999 and
2009.163
Modal integration has been given minimal
deliberate consideration in developing-country
cities. Yet, although not by design, informal and
non-motorized modes do serve as an important gap
filler by feeding other modes of transport. Mexico

substituting, without subsidies, the failing public
bus system.
Some notable achievements in modal integration are emerging in Asian and Latin American cities.
In China, Guangzhou’s BRT system – which serves
800,000 passengers daily – is integrated with the
city’s bike lanes and bike share system, greatly
enhancing physical access to public transport
services.164 The cities of São Paulo, Curitiba (both in
Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile) have
all taken action to advance integration between
public and non-motorized transport.165
Many of the attempts to facilitate intermodality
between non-motorized and public transport in cities
to date have focused on integrating cycling. Yet, the
contribution of walking as a feeder to public transport systems has also been emphasized.166 This also
applies to developing countries, where most public
transport trips involve walking at both ends of the trip.
An analysis of access trips for Delhi Metro (India), for
instance, found that often between 40 and 60 per
cent of the passengers walk to the stations.167

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY

In the absence of
accessible public
transport services,
informal transport
remains
predominant in
developing
countries

‘Accessibility’ may be the ‘holy grail’ for the twentyfirst century city. Yet, the transport trends and
conditions outlined in this chapter indicate that
cities remain inaccessible for large numbers of urban
residents in spatial/physical or socioeconomic terms.
In turn, such limitations restrict access to opportunities for urban dwellers, with implications for their
overall wellbeing and progress.
Public transport offers the greatest potential to
enhance accessibility in cities, but is non-existent or
declining in most developing countries, and increases
in developed countries are not commensurate with
the scale required to meet sustainability targets. A
new business model for funding public transport
needs to be forged. Public transport must always
remain affordable but a new commercial paradigm
is needed that allows the social dimension of providing a public service to be combined with
efficiencies and commercial acumen to improve cost
recovery. Moving from captive riders (passengers) to
clients and choice riders, making public transport a
lifestyle choice, requires a strong customer focus.
Despite the multiple benefits it generates for
both users and society as a whole, NMT is often
marginalized and receives minimal priority in urban
mobility planning and investments, both in developed
and developing countries. It constitutes the principal
and often only accessible means of transport for the
majority of residents in developing-country cities
with most who opt for this mode doing so out of a
lack of choice. Yet, in most cities, NMT conditions

are extremely hostile. Investing in NMT to enhance
the safety and security of walking and cycling
constitutes a key pillar of planning and design for
accessible mobility in cities. Innovative experiences
from both developed and developing-country cities
that have elevated NMT as a foundation for urban
sustainability offer valuable insights to inform
planning and investments elsewhere.
Perhaps one of the most alarming trends – which
gravely threatens urban accessibility – is the steady
increase in the share of private motorized transport.
Almost 60 years after the private car became firmly
fixed as the icon of the twentieth century, developing countries are experiencing extremely high
motorization rates further supported by policies,
actions and investments that favour private motorized
over non-motorized and public transport modes.
While motorization rates have generally reached
saturation levels in developed countries, many of their
cities continue to bear the consequences of urban
and transport planning and land-use policies that
facilitated car dependency and urban sprawl. While
it does perform a necessary function within the
overall arena of urban transport, where it dominates,
the externalities of private motorized transport compromise the fundamental sustainability imperatives
in cities. Addressing the broader welfare concerns
around equal access to mobility thus necessitates
action to enable shifts to more sustainable modes
through deliberate and targeted policies and investments.
In the absence of accessible public transport
services, informal transport remains predominant in
developing countries and constitutes the main means
of motorized trips for most urban dwellers. Although
it provides essential benefits to the urban poor in
terms of mobility and livelihoods, informal transport
generates a number of environmental and economic
externalities. A significant challenge is to balance the
efficiency and social equity aspects of informal
transport, i.e. to achieve the social benefits of freemarket services without exceeding social costs. The
sector would benefit immensely from best-practice
examples of successful regulation of service quality
and safety while at the same time allowing the
inherent advantages of private competition and
entrepreneurship to flourish.
Given the current state of urban transport
globally, improved urban accessibility requires
focusing on a number of vital pillars. Increasing the
modal share of public transport is a universally
applicable strategy that has significant potential to
address mobility challenges of both developed and
developing countries. The role of high-capacity public
transport systems in this respect is underscored in
Chapter 3 of this report and the social, environmental
and economic sustainability benefits of public transport are featured in Chapters 6, 7 and 8. Efforts to

enhance urban accessibility are best not limited to
mode-specific interventions and investments. There
is abounding evidence indicating that intermodality,
or the integration of infrastructure and services
across modes, to facilitate trip-chaining and multimodal trips, is a vital precondition for accessibility.
Urban planning and design principles that offer
potential for this are elaborated in greater detail in
Chapter 5. Effective institutional, regulatory and

policy frameworks are also indispensable to
facilitate urban, land-use and transport planning in
an integrated manner that encourages shifts towards
more sustainable modes of transport, as is discussed
in Chapter 9. Finally, accessible mobility in cities
cannot be considered in isolation from the movement of goods in urban areas that consumes significant space and interacts with passenger transport at
times in adverse ways, as accentuated in Chapter 4.

METRO, LIGHT RAIL
AND BRT
This chapter reviews the global conditions, trends and
challenges for the main high-capacity transport
options: metro, light rail and BRT. Such public transport modes offer solutions for improving urban
mobility, quality of life and the environment in both
developed and developing countries, providing a
competitive alternative to private motor vehicles. An
efficient system facilitates seamless movement within
and between cities, which in turn is essential for
urban functionality and prosperity.1 Metros, light rail
and BRTs are suitable for key corridors in cities and
as part of larger, integrated public transport systems.
High-capacity public transport systems are
strategic in shaping urban form, promoting higher
densities as well as mixed and accessible land use.
Such modes reduce the need for trips by private
motorized travel, and may thus reduce the total
kilometres travelled in cars and motorcycles, mitigating negative externalities such as air pollution, road
traffic accidents, lack of physical activity, noise and
greenhouse gas emissions. They are also important
in providing inclusive access for vulnerable and lowincome groups, and in creating jobs.
In the urban planning dialogue, opinions regarding metro, light rail and BRT are diversified, with
arguments in favour of and against each mode.2 In
this chapter, these three modes are explored, demonstrating the importance of undertaking comprehensive evaluations that consider all significant
benefits and costs of high-capacity public transport
systems, prior to implementation. The chapter also
presents an overview of current global conditions and
trends, including some challenges: service quality,
integration, finance and institutions. The chapter
concludes with key policy recommendations.

MAIN CHARACTERISTICS
OF METRO, LIGHT RAIL AND
BRT SYSTEMS
Metro, light rail and BRT are all intended to provide
fast, comfortable and cost-effective urban mobility

in medium- to high-demand corridors. These modes
of public transport, which use specific fixed or exclusive and separated tracks, have superior operating
capacity and performance compared to unsegregated
road-based transport such as buses, taxis and
paratransit.3 In principle, the introduction of metro,
light rail and/or BRT can produce important benefits
to a city: it can improve the efficiency of the urban
economy by reducing travel cost and time; it can
increase the level of city-centre activity, thereby
enhancing agglomeration economies that are crucial
for the prosperity of urban areas; and it can reduce
road congestion, which would then provide various
other economic and environmental benefits. In cities
where these modes are dominant, they improve the
access to opportunities and services, and may be
beneficial to the urban poor in a number of ways.4

Metro
Metro is an urban electric transport system using rail
tracks, exhibiting high capacity and a high frequency
of service.5 Independent from other vehicles, roads
or pedestrian traffic, metros are designed for
operations using tunnels, viaducts or at surface levels,
but with physically separated infrastructure. In some
parts of the world, the metro system is also known
as underground, tube, subway, rapid rail or metropolitan railway.6 With metros, carrying capacity of
more than 30,000 passengers per hour per direction
is possible.7 Globally, metros have evolved as a major
form of public transport, since the first underground
railway opened in London in 1863.8 Although metro
systems are the most expensive urban public transport option, their high capacity and best performance (in terms of speed and number of passengers
conveyed), make them invaluable parts of highly
developed transport systems. Accordingly, metro
systems require huge investments and are often
implemented as the preferred option of large cities
where demand justifies that high capital cost.9

Light rail

Bus rapid transit

Light rail can be described as an electric rail-borne
transport, and can be developed in stages to increase
capacity and speed.10 Through the provision of
exclusive right-of-way lanes, light rail systems typically
operate at the surface level with overhead electrical
connectors, and may have high or low platform
loading and multi- or single-car trains.11 Often,
segregation is introduced, or priority given to light
rail at road junctions, in order to increase speed
and service reliability. The general term ‘light rail’
covers those systems whose role and performance
lie between a conventional bus service and a metro.12
Light rail systems are therefore flexible and expandable. Historically, light rail systems evolved from the
‘streetcars’, ‘trolleycars’ or ‘tramways’ that started in
the second half of the nineteenth century as horsedriven carts. With the advent of electricity, tramways
became very popular around 1900 and most large
cities in developed countries, as well as a few cities
in developing countries, had tram systems. After the
Second World War, many trams were removed from
cities, although many were later modernized and
reintroduced in the last part of the twentieth century,
as an intermediate, flexible, lower cost public transport mode. Given the relatively high cost of light rail
systems, they are often found in wealthy cities and
in proximity to high-income developments.13

BRT is a bus-based mode of public transport operating
on exclusive right-of-way lanes at the surface level,
although, in some cases, underpasses or tunnels are
utilized to provide grade separation at intersections
in dense city centres.14 The term ‘BRT’ was initially
coined in the US15 and the first wide-scale development of BRT was implemented in Curitiba, Brazil,
in 1982.16 Other names for BRT are ‘high-capacity
bus system’, ‘high-quality bus system’, ‘metro-bus’,
‘surface metro’, ‘express bus system’ and ‘busway
system’.17 While the terms may vary from country to
country, the basic premise is followed: a high-quality
customer-oriented public transport that is fast, safe,
comfortable, reliable and cost-effective. The best
BRT systems flexibly combine stations, bus services,
busways and information technologies into an
integrated system with a strong identity.18 Depending
on the specific system design, BRT capital costs are
4–20 times lower than light rail systems, and 10–100
times lower than metro systems, with similar capacity
and service level.19

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Metro and light rail systems produce little noise, have
low emissions of air pollutants (including greenhouse
gases) and have high reliability. In addition, metro
systems do not use limited road space on the surface,
thus ensuring a consistently reliable and high-quality
service. Nevertheless, metro and light rail systems
have limited flexibility and require bus or intermediate public transport feeder services for lastkilometre connectivity. Furthermore, the distance
between stations is usually higher in metros than in
light rail and BRT in order to enable higher travel
speeds. While this speeds up long distance commutes, it also requires longer distances for passengers to access stations.
The key variables for evaluating high-capacity
public transport systems include capacity, commercial
speed and cost. Figure 3.1 indicates that BRT can
provide high-capacity services – similar to that of
metros and higher than that of light rail systems –
at a fraction of their capital costs.20 While commercial
speeds delivered by BRT and light rail systems are
usually lower than metros, some BRT systems reach
significantly higher speeds than light rail (when using
express services or fully separated facilities in
expressways). It is also important to note that while
elevated and underground metro systems average
similar capacities, their initial costs of construction
vary greatly (Figure 3.1). A more detailed discussion
of construction and operating costs for the various
transport modes can be found in Chapter 8.

EXAMPLES OF NATIONAL
POLICIES TOWARD HIGHCAPACITY PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES

With financial and
technical
assistance from
the national, state
and local
governments, the
cities of Kolkata,
Chennai, Delhi
and Bangalore
currently have
operational metro
systems

Rail-based public transport systems have been a
natural part of the development of urban infrastructure in developed countries’ cities. However,
cities in developing countries have struggled in
this respect due to financial and institutional limitations. Nevertheless, in the last 15 years, several
developing-country cities have started implementing
BRT systems, and some have initiated or expanded
light rail and metros. Furthermore, national governments are co-financing public transport infrastructure in order to support the large proportion of the
population now living in urban areas, including considerations of energy security, economic efficiency
and climate change. This section provides examples
from selected developing countries that have
introduced national policies to support high-capacity
urban public transport systems.

China
In 2011, the Government of China, through the
Ministry of Transport, introduced the ‘public transport city’ project to improve the service level of urban
public transport and alleviate traffic congestion in
Chinese cities. Supported by the Ministry of Transport, the demonstration projects (in 30 selected
cities) will include the construction of public transport hubs, implementation of ‘intelligent transport
systems’, energy conservation and emission reduction
practices in public transport. Additional financial
support for the demonstration projects will be
provided at the national level and co-financed by
provincial governments.
As a result of the national support, several
Chinese cities have started the construction or
expanded their public transport networks in the
form of metro, light rail and BRT systems. Beijing,
for instance, is implementing a very ambitious rail
expansion programme. In 2012, the Beijing metro
had 16 lines, with 442 kilometres of track length
and 251 stations, becoming the longest metro network in the world.21 Expansion plans call for 708
kilometres of track in operation by 2015 and 1050
kilometres by 2020.
A number of other Chinese cities are also
expanding their metro systems, namely: Hong Kong,
Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Dalian, Wuhan,
Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanjing, Shenyang, Chengdu,
Guangfo, Xi’an, Suzhou, Kunming and Hangzhou. In
addition, there are currently 18 cities with metro and
light rail systems under construction, and a further
22 cities where construction is either being planned
or pending approval. With respect to BRT, a total of
15 Chinese cities had operational systems, while
another 11 systems were either under construction
or at the planning stage by 2012.

India
In 2005, the Government of India created the US$20
billion Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal
Mission (JnNURM) to fund urban infrastructure
improvements and basic services to the urban poor
in 65 cities for the 2005–2011 period.22 It is
expected that the programme will be renewed in
2013, as part of the sixth five-year plan.
With financial and technical assistance from the
national, state and local governments, the cities of
Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi and Bangalore currently have
operational metro systems. Encouraged by Delhi’s
success, six other Indian cities have metro systems
under construction, while metro systems in another
eleven cities are in various planning stages. In Delhi,
where metro operations commenced in 2002, there
are currently 193 kilometres of metro tracks (with
145 stations). Expansion plans include another 140
kilometres (approved) and 139 kilometres (proposed)

for a total network of 472 kilometres to be completed
by 2021.23
In addition to the various metro systems under
construction, busways exist in Delhi, Pune and Jaipur,
while Ahmedabad has a fully operational BRT system
(75 kilometres long, with additional 80 kilometres
under construction or being planned). Furthermore,
BRT systems are currently being introduced in the
cities of Rajkot, Surat, Indore, Hyderabad, PimpriChinchwad, Visakapatnam and Bhopal. Another eight
cities are planning the introduction of BRT systems.

Brazil
The Government of Brazil is responsible for promoting improvements in public urban transport. As
a result, every city with more than 20,000 inhabitants
(i.e. some 1600 cities) is required to develop a
mobility master plan linked to its urban development
plans. The National Policy on Urban Mobility gives
priority to non-motorized transport and public
transportation, over private motorized transport. It
also seeks to limit or restrict motor vehicle use in a
given geographic area or during a specific time period.
Other measures sought by the policy to reduce traffic
congestion and air pollution include establishing
congestion and pollution tolls, as well as emission
standards for air pollutants.
To support investment in public transport, the
federal government created two programmes ‘Protransporte’ and ‘Growth Acceleration Programme’,
in preparation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and
the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Projects include
BRT lanes in 9 of the 12 cities that will host World
Cup matches, including Rio de Janeiro and Belo
Horizonte. In four cities, including São Paulo and
Brasília, light rail systems such as monorails and
trams are being built, with another five cities planning
the adoption of the same. Currently, there are eight
cities with metro: Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Porto
Alegre, Fortaleza, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo
and Teresina.
Inspired by the bus lanes implemented in
Curitiba in the 1970s, 31 cities in Brazil currently
have BRT systems or bus ways, totalling 696 kilometres. Most of the already existing busway corridors
in Brazil need renovation and the BRT systems offer
the opportunity of increasing public transport productivity, while overcoming the problems generated by
the multiple superimposed radial routes, converging
to terminals located at city centres. Several cities –
including Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Salvador,
Brasília and Belém – are currently upgrading some
sections of existing busways to BRT standards.

Mexico
In 2008, the Government of Mexico created the
PROTRAM (Federal Support Programme for Public
Transport), to improve urban transport efficiency and
to reduce urban greenhouse gas emissions. To date,
PROTRAM has given financial support to 11 BRT
systems and 1 suburban rail system. Other pipeline
projects in 34 cities are earmarked for funding from
this programme, which provides both grants and
credits.
Mexico has a metro system in its capital Mexico
City; light rail systems in Guadalajara and Monterrey;
and BRT systems in León, Mexico City, Guadalajara,
Ecatepec and Monterrey.

Kenya
In 2009, the Government of Kenya launched the
Integrated National Transport Policy, which seeks
to establish appropriate institutional and regulatory
frameworks to coordinate and harmonize the
management and provision of passenger transport
services. Among the policy recommendations is the
establishment of independent institutions to manage
urban passenger transport services and operations.24
The policy further envisions increasing use of
high-capacity public transport through the provision
of railway infrastructure for Nairobi and its environs.
Consequently, the government opened the Syokimau
Railway station in the suburbs of Nairobi in 2012.
The railway service from this station to the city
centre has reduced travel time by half over the 18kilometre journey. Furthermore, authorities have
also ensured that the railway is integrated with other
modes, as last-mile link buses have been introduced
to boost the city commuter train service.25
The transport policy also envisages the provision
of infrastructure to support public transport services,
i.e. bus lanes, promotion (through fiscal incentives)
of high-occupancy public transport vehicles and discouraging private motor vehicle use once the public
transport system is efficient.26 In 2012, the Government of Kenya, supported by the World Bank,
launched the National Urban Transport Improvement
Project (NUTRIP) to support the development of
selected high-capacity public transport corridors.27

Morocco
The Government of Morocco has embarked on
reforming the transport sector along three main
pillars: improving the sector’s governance; improving
the efficiency and developing the supply of urban
transport services and infrastructure; and improving
the environmental and social sustainability of urban
transport.28 Significant investments have been made
towards light rail systems in the cities of Casablanca
and Rabat-Salé. Commissioned in 2011, the tramway

line between Rabat and Salé consists of 44 trams,
with an expected daily ridership of 180,000 passengers. The total length of the dual-line tramway network is 19.5 kilometres and consists of 31 stations
that are spaced a half kilometre apart.29
In Casablanca, the tramway development
company acquired 74 trams for the 31 kilometres
Y-shaped network, which commenced operations in
2012. The line has 48 stops and has an expected daily
ridership of 255,000 passengers.30

Nigeria

The rapid increase
in the number of
rail-based systems
is an indication of
the importance
of metros in
facilitating
mobility,
particularly in
large urban areas
that are beyond
city limits

Nigeria’s 2010 National Transport Policy seeks to
develop an efficient, self-sustaining and reliable public
transport system, and to improve the infrastructure
and institutional framework for public transport
service delivery. It also aims to enhance the capacity
of the existing infrastructure through proper maintenance of roadways and efficient traffic management.
Furthermore, it calls for the substantial expansion
of urban infrastructure, with emphasis on public
transport infrastructure – railway, dedicated bus
routes, etc.31
The policy envisions the introduction of a highcapacity bus-based transport system that can be
accommodated by the existing infrastructure. Already
there are dedicated bus routes in Lagos, where a BRT
is being implemented. The policy also aims to
promote private sector participation in urban public
transport services and in the long-term introduce
rapid rail systems into the country’s major cities.
To advance the efficiency of urban transport
system operations and management, an autonomous
body – the Municipal Transportation Agency – will
be established in each major city. The task of these
agencies will be, inter alia, the regulation, planning,
designing and maintenance of urban transport infrastructure facilities.

South Africa
Asian cities

largest share of
metro ridership,
totalling more
than 51 million

In South Africa, the Public Transport Strategy aims
to improve public transport by establishing an
integrated rapid public transport network that
comprises of an integrated package of rapid rail and
road corridors. Through BRT, the government aims
to link different parts of a city into a network and
ensure that by 2020, most city residents are no more
than 500 metres away from a BRT station.32 The BRT
systems are being implemented through public–
private partnerships, whereby cities build and
maintain the infrastructure for the operation of the
buses, stations, depots, control centres and a fare
collection system. Private operators, by contrast,
own and manage the buses, hire staff and provide
services on a long-term contract.
In Johannesburg, the Rea Vaya BRT is being
implemented in phases across in the city since 2009.

Notably, the first trunk route running between Ellis
Park in Doornfontein and Thokoza Park in Soweto
has been completed. The long-term plan is for the
Rea Vaya route to cover 330 kilometres, allowing
more than 80 per cent of Johannesburg’s residents
to catch a bus within 500 metres from a BRT station.33
In addition to Johannesburg’s BRT system, Cape
Town also has a BRT system known as MyCiTi,34
while Tshwane is implementing Tshwane BRT that
will cover some 80 kilometres of bus lines.35
The Gauteng Provincial Government has
implemented Gautrain, which is South Africa’s first
high-speed passenger railway line, connecting OR
Tambo International Airport with the cities of
Johannesburg and Pretoria. The 80-kilometre highspeed passenger railway network comprises of two
routes: the north–south line connecting Pretoria and
Hatfield Johannesburg; and an east–west line from
Sandton to the airport, which is supported by a
network of feeder buses serving most of its ten
stations.

METRO SYSTEMS AROUND
THE WORLD:TRENDS AND
CONDITIONS
Due to government stimulus programmes in the
wake of the global financial crisis, the world market
for railway infrastructure and equipment has been
growing at 3.2 per cent a year, and is set to grow at
around 2.7 per cent annually until 2017. Spending
on metro rail systems should grow faster still, at
perhaps 6–8 per cent.36 Figure 3.2 shows the growth
of metro rail systems around the world in terms of
the number of cities with operational systems.37
By 1970, there were a total of 40 cities worldwide
with metro systems, followed by a rapid increase
during the next four decades. Currently, there are
187 cities with a metro system as part of their public
transport system.38 Box 3.1 provides an overview
of the growth of metros across the world. The rapid
increase in the number of rail-based systems is an
indication of the importance of metros in facilitating
mobility, particularly in large urban areas that are
beyond city limits. Notably, metros are less prone to
congestion than roadways and are important to those
residing in peripheral locations, as they commute long
distances to employment centres and other activity
nodes.39
The global distribution of metro systems in
Figure 3.3 shows a concentration of metros in
Europe, Eastern Asia and the eastern part of the
US. The regional distribution in terms of number of
cities and ridership is presented in Table 3.3. Asian
cities account for the largest share of metro ridership,
totalling more than 51 million riders a day. In terms
of total track length of metros, Asian cities account

Box 3.1 The growth of metros around the world
The building of metro systems accelerated from the 1960s,
mainly in reaction to the growth of sprawling megametropolises around the world. Currently, 187 cities have
metros, with more to come amid a fresh spurt of construction
in developing countries. In 2012, the Chinese cities of Suzhou,
Kunming and Hangzhou opened their metros, as did the city of
Lima in Peru. In 2011, Algiers (Algeria) was the second African
capital to launch a metro system.
Whereas China’s investment in high-speed intercity
railways is tailing off, evidence suggests that it is still pumping
money into metros. So is India: Bangalore’s metro was
launched in 2011, which will soon be followed by Mumbai.
Smaller cities, such as Bhopal and Jaipur, have plans on the
drawing-board. Brazil is expanding metro systems in its two
main cities, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, while building new
ones in smaller cities such as Salvador and Cuiabá.

Metros are being built in various smaller cities, such as in
Dubai, where the world’s longest driverless metro (75
kilometres) became operational in 2009; followed by Mecca’s
in 2010. Abu Dhabi, Doha, Bahrain, Riyadh and Kuwait City
have plans in progress. Other cities planning to build metros
include Asunción in Paraguay and Kathmandu in Nepal.
Many congested cities in developing countries have spent
years planning metro systems. However, very little progress
has been made towards implementation. A prime example is
Algeria’s 1991–2002 civil war that accounts for the long
gestation period of its capital’s metro. In other cases, sluggish
(and sometimes corrupt) bureaucracies are the main obstacle.
In 2008, Indonesia’s traffic-choked capital, Jakarta, abandoned
its attempt to build a monorail and built a successful busway as
a stopgap instead. Since then, the city’s governor has promised
to commence work on an underground metro.

for 41 per cent. European cities also depend heavily
on metro systems for urban mobility, accounting for
more than 38 million daily riders or 34 per cent of
global ridership, and 35 per cent of global track
length. This is followed by Latin America and the
Caribbean, as well as North American cities that
account for 11.5 per cent and 8.6 per cent of the
world’s metro ridership, respectively. The two African
cities that have metros – Algiers and Cairo – have a

8.5 million, 6.9 million and 6.7 million passengers
per day, respectively. In Tokyo, Japan, the modal share
of public transport is nearly 80 per cent of all motorized trips, with the metro accounting for a significant
proportion.40 In Shanghai, China, top priority has
been given to the extension of the city’s subway
with the opening of six additional lines in 2010, and
a planned four-fold increase of the current 423
kilometres of track length by 2020.41 In 2007, the
city’s metro accounted for 13 per cent of its total
public transport; and with further investment this was
expected to increase to 45 per cent by 2012, thus
reducing the dependence on private cars.
Several developing-country cities, particularly
in China, have been able to expand their metro
networks in a short time. For instance, Beijing, which
has one of the two most developed subway systems
in China, has the highest use of public transport in
the country.42 Since 2005, Beijing has allocated 30
per cent of its public construction budget to its

public transport system, including its metro. Whereas
Beijing’s public transport system is strong by Chinese
standards, its citizens do not utilize public transportation as much as the residents of other cities,
such as Seoul (Republic of Korea) and Tokyo (Japan).
As a result, the emission of air pollutants from mobile
sources remains one of the government’s most urgent
challenges.
Since its launch in 1987, the metro system in
Cairo, Egypt, has gradually been expanded and the
total track length now measures 90 kilometres.43
Likewise, the metro’s modal share of all trips has
increased steadily from 6 per cent just after the
launch to 17 per cent in 2001. The total number of
passengers using the metro has continued to increase,
from 2 million per day in 2001 to more than 3 million
in 2012, partly due to its relatively affordable fares.44
A comparison between metro systems worldwide
reveals certain trends. First, a majority of these cities
have very large populations. For instance, Tokyo’s

Box 3.2 Metros, urban structure and land use
The integration of metro systems within the urban fabric
makes some important demands on the planning system.
Rights-of-way must be established and protected. Space must
be released for depots and terminals. In addition, where highdensity ancillary developments are intended, the land must be
assembled into lots suitable for development and the
appropriate densities of development sanctioned.
The most indisputable structuring effect of metros is that
they allow central business districts in large dynamic cities to
continue growing, where service by road, either by car or bus,
would be increasingly frustrated by congestion. Without the
high-capacity links, activities would begin to be decentralized.
This has implications both for city planning and for project
evaluation. A conscious attempt to maintain the growth of the
city centre will save on public infrastructure costs in other
areas; avoiding these extra costs is an important part of the
long-term benefit of metro investments.
Unfortunately, the magnitude of those savings is little
researched, particularly in developing countries, and the
economic evaluation of metro investments is usually based on
the more conventional user cost–benefit appraisal. While that

metro has the largest ridership in the world, and is
located in the world’s most populous urban agglomeration (with some 37 million inhabitants45).
Similarly, major urban agglomerations such as
New York and Mexico City, each with an estimated
population of more than 20 million have metro
systems that carry 4.5 million passengers daily. Being
large also implies that metro cities are often the most
fiscally sound, while small municipalities lack
economies of scale necessary to construct and operate
metros. Some of the links between metro systems
and urban structure are highlighted in Box 3.2, and
further explored in Chapter 5.
Second, urban areas with metro systems have
often extended or grown beyond their established
boundaries, engulfing surrounding areas, adjacent
towns and sometimes into different provinces.
For instance, Mexico City has encroached upon
municipalities in two states. Tokyo (Japan), which
has the world’s largest metro system, has 75 per cent
of its estimated 37.2 million population living in
suburban areas.46 In China, Shanghai encompasses a mega-urban region occupying an area of over
6340 square kilometres, with the Beijing megaurban region extending over 16,870 square kilometres.47 This implies that the governance of metro
systems has to go beyond the traditional city limits.
The metropolitization of neighbouring districts,
municipalities and cities through cross-boundary
institutions offers significant benefits in terms of
efficiency, construction and operation costs, including creating economic synergies among newly

may still be justifiable, in the interest of avoiding the worst
kind of ‘white elephants’, a more wide-ranging multi-criteria
analysis may be the most suitable way of ensuring that those
unmeasured effects are taken into consideration. An
integrated land use, urban transport and air quality strategy,
such as the Integrated Urban Transport Plan in São Paulo, is
needed to ensure that the metro system is adequately inserted
in the urban structure.
Obtaining desirable structuring effects outside the city
centre is more difficult. Clustered multi-nuclear development
associated with station locations sometimes occurs
spontaneously, but normally requires either some planning by
government (as in the cases of Singapore and Hong Kong,
China) or close links between private ownership of the metro
system and contiguous developments (as is common in Japan).
In both cases, this requires land to be assembled for development in relatively large lots. This has been achieved by
comprehensive public ownership of land in Hong Kong, by
compulsory public purchase in Singapore and through market
mechanisms in some Japanese private railway developments.

connected areas. This is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 9.
Third, many of the cities with metro systems are
either capital cities or large cities in their respective
countries. Capital cities account for 9 of the 16 cities
with the world’s largest metro systems (Table 3.4),
and 27 per cent of all cities with metros. The rest
are major cities. For instance, in China, Japan and
Germany, besides the capital cities, 15, 12 and 18
cities in these countries respectively have metros.
Being the national capital or major city can determine
the extent to which countries invest in metro
systems. This is because apart from generating more
revenue, capital or large cities dominate the system
of settlements and perform major administrative,
commercial, diplomatic, financial and industrial
functions. In order to perform these functions
effectively, capitals and other large cities need an
efficient and integrated public transport system that
includes metros.

LIGHT RAIL SYSTEMS
AROUND THE WORLD:
TRENDS AND CONDITIONS
Light rail is a flexible concept that evolved from the
nineteenth century horse-driven rail carts.48 The reemergence as an alternative means of transport to
cars or buses was due to its potential to mitigate
congestion and support mobility in urban centres.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Light rail systems have proliferated in both developed
and developing countries in the last decades. Among
European countries, light rail systems have been
particularly evident in the UK, France, Spain, Portugal
and Italy. These countries have successfully improved
the quality of service and the image of the light rail
system at affordable costs. Consequently, the last 20
years have seen many cities in Asia, Africa and Latin
America reintroduce light rail systems.
In 2013, there are approximately 400 light rail
and tram systems in operation worldwide, while
construction of additional systems is ongoing in a
further 60 cities. An additional 200 light rail systems
are either being constructed or at various planning
stages.49 There is a strong concentration of light rail
systems in Western Europe (170 systems) and in the
US (more than 30 systems). Eastern Europe and
Central Asian countries also have a fair concentration
of light rail systems. The growing popularity of light
rail systems can be attributed to their ability to
provide significant transport capacity, without the
expense and density needed for metro systems.50
Several African countries have developed light rail
systems such as Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia. In Algiers
(Algeria), the tramway commenced service in 2010.
When fully completed and operational, the tramway
is expected to carry between 150,000 and 185,000
passengers per day.51 In addition, the Oran tramway
was launched in May 2013. The Oran tramway is
18.7 km long and can carry 90,000 passengers per
day.52 A number of other African countries have light
rail projects in the pipeline. Ethiopia, for instance,
is implementing a light rail project in Addis Ababa,
covering a distance of 34 kilometres.53 Furthermore,
Mauritius is scheduled to commence work on a light
rail system in 2014, covering a 28-kilometre corridor
between the cities of Curepipe and St Louis.54
Globally, light rail systems are challenged by
ageing or obsolete assets, as well as the increasing
popularity of the private car. As a result, transport
authorities in many cities are rejuvenating their
existing light rail infrastructure or constructing
completely new systems. Increased environmental

consciousness and soaring fuel costs are also
motivating more and more people to opt for public
transport. As indicated in Table 3.5, the leading light
rail systems in the world (in terms of ridership) are
in Hong Kong and Manila.
The last two decades have seen several European
cities either overhauling or implementing new light
rail and tram systems as a cornerstone of their
redevelopment efforts. For example, trams are part
of the transformation of 24 French cities, including
Nantes, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Clermont-Ferrand and
Marseille. Other cities such as Lille and Lyon, Caen,
Brest, Nancy and Toulon are advancing planning
efforts. The tram networks in France are expected
to reach a total track length of 610 kilometres by
2015.55 Even cities without light rail, such as Astana,
Kazakhstan, have reached advanced stages with plans
for the implementation of light rail.56
An expansion of tram networks is evident in
other European cities. A study shows that 40 cities
and municipalities in the 15 EU countries had a total
length of 488 kilometres under construction in 2009.
A further 55 cities and municipalities had planned
1086 kilometres of network developments: 268
kilometres for new systems and 818 kilometres for
expansions.57
Light rail systems are beneficial for their
technology and low emissions, and are also seen as
symbols of national pride. Mayors such as SamuelWeis from the French city of Mulhouse have
indicated: ‘We wanted a tram that called attention
to itself, as a symbol of economic vitality, environmental awareness and civic improvement – transportation as an integrated cultural concept’.58

BRT SYSTEMS AROUND
THE WORLD:TRENDS AND
CONDITIONS
Compared to metro and light rail systems, BRT is a
relatively recent phenomenon, starting with the
implementation of the first busway in Curitiba (Brazil)
in the early 1970s.59 However, bus priority measures
were in place years before the Curitiba BRT system
was implemented. Since then, there has been a
worldwide increase in the adoption of BRT systems.
As of mid-2013, there were 156 cities worldwide
with BRT and bus corridors; most of them implemented in the last decade (Figure 3.4).60
Since BRT and metro systems are both rapid
public transport systems, a comparison of their
growth and performance is inevitable. BRT systems
are concentrated in Latin America and the Caribbean
(64 per cent of global ridership) and Asia (27 per cent)
(Table 3.6 and Figure 3.5). The total ridership for
BRT – 25.7 million passengers per day – is only 23
per cent of the ridership of metro systems. In terms
of system lengths, however, BRT systems cover a total

of 4072 kilometres,61 or almost 40 per cent of the
total length of all the world’s metro systems.
The major BRT systems in the world – i.e. those
with a ridership of over 300,000 passengers per day
– are listed in Table 3.7. BRT systems are not yet
comparable to metro systems in terms of their total
track length and daily demand; the longest metro
system (Beijing) is 3.3 times longer than the longest
BRT system (Jakarta), while the most popular (in
terms of daily ridership) (London) carries four times
more passengers than the most used BRT (São Paulo).
In Bogotá, Colombia, the TransMilenio BRT
provides fast and reliable transport for over 1.8
million passengers per day and in the process reduces
traffic congestion.62 Travel time has been reduced
by 34 per cent and traffic fatalities by 88 per cent.
In the case of Curitiba (Brazil), 70 per cent of commuters use the BRT to travel to work, thus resulting
in a reduction of 27 million auto trips per year.63
When compared with eight other Brazilian cities of
similar size, Curitiba uses 30 per cent less fuel per
capita. This helps achieve air quality and other
environmental goals. By making high-capacity public
transport more accessible, affordable and customer
friendly, BRT has the potential to increase overall
public transport ridership. In Curitiba, the BRT serves

2010

over 1.3 million passengers daily with commuters
spending about 10 per cent of their income on transport – much less than the national average.64
Recently, African cities have made remarkable
strides in developing BRT as part of their public
transport systems. In 2008, Lagos (Nigeria) launched
a BRT ‘lite’ corridor (a high-quality system that is
affordable in the local context, while retaining as
many of the desirable BRT characteristics as possible).
This marked the first substantial investment in public
transport for the city. The system was launched with
a 22-kilometre route, 26 stations and 220 highcapacity buses, and it was designed to carry 60,000
passengers a day. By 2010, it was carrying 220,000
passengers per day, with more than 100 million
person-trips being made in the first 21 months of
operation. The ‘lite’ version of BRT halves the costs
(about US$2.75 million per kilometre), however,
capacity is limited as it uses kerb-aligned busways (not
median-aligned busways) and the total route is not
on a separated busway. As such, the overall speed
(and capacity) of the BRT system is reduced.65
The Lagos BRT has brought about many positive
changes.66 Since its implementation, over 200,000
commuters use this bus system daily, with passengers enjoying a 30 per cent decrease in average

fares. Furthermore, commuters have been able to
reduce their travel time by 40 per cent and waiting
time by 35 per cent, and experience safe, clean and
reliable transport. Other significant socioeconomic
benefits include the creation of direct employment
for 1000 people and indirect employment for over
500,000 people. The Lagos BRT has demonstrated
that local operators can run successful public transport systems.67
The success of the Lagos BRT can be attributed
to the leadership and political commitment at all
levels of government; and a capable, strategic public
transport authority (LAMATA), a focus on user needs
and deliverability within a budget and programme.
Also core to the Lagos BRT success was a community
engagement programme, which assured citizens that
the BRT ‘lite’ system is a project created, owned and
used by them.68 This type of engagement was crucial,
as Lagos residents had little experience with organized public transport. Due to a history of poor delivery
of transport improvements – and with prior systems

that sought to ensure that profit was directed to the
already well-to-do – the community engagement
sought to rid the residents of scepticism and suspicion
of motives and intentions regarding the project.69
With the impetus from the 2010 World Cup,
three South African cities (Johannesburg, Cape
Town and Port Elizabeth) all initiated BRT lines. The
Johannesburg Rea Vaya system was the first full BRT
line in Africa (2009), operating on a 22-kilometre
route, costing US$5.5 million per kilometre, travelling at 25 kilometres per hour and carrying 16,000
passengers daily. In 2011, the completed Phase 1
included 122 kilometres of busways and carried
434,000 passengers daily.70
In Johannesburg, the Rea Vaya BRT links the
central business district with Braamfontein and
Soweto, providing fast, reliable and affordable transport for 80,000 passengers per day, and in the
process, reduces traffic congestion on that route.71
In terms of employment, the Rea Vaya has created
more than 800 permanent jobs and about 6840

temporary construction jobs.72 Approximately 350 of
these employees are recruited among taxi drivers who
were affected by the launch and subsequent
operation of the BRT system.73 Transport authorities
in Johannesburg paid special attention to ensuring
that the Rea Vaya BRT was functional and attractive.
This included pre-paid tickets; level boarding for full
accessibility; multiple stopping bays; and weatherprotected stations. Furthermore, the stations have
been designed with the local urban environment in
mind and local artists have been commissioned.74
Additional BRT schemes are being developed in
Lagos, Nigeria, as well as the aforementioned South
African cities. Similarly, other African cities are also
investing in high-quality, efficient and environmentally clean transport. These include Accra
(Ghana), Kampala (Uganda), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania),
Nairobi (Kenya) and several other South African
cities (Bloemfontein, Durban, East London, Pretoria,
Ekurhuleni, Polokwane and Rustenburg). This
demonstrates the increasing shift from informal
public transport systems to high-technology BRT
systems.75

MAIN CHALLENGES FACING
HIGH-CAPACITY PUBLIC
TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
Despite their growth, high-capacity public transport
systems still face a number of challenges, especially
in developing countries. This section discusses some
of the main challenges, which include: integration
(within the public transport system, with other
modes and with the urban form); quality of service;
finance; and institutions.

Integration within the public transport
system
Integration occurs at three levels: physical, operational and fare. Physical integration allows for direct
connections from one service to another, usually
including transfer facilities and terminals. Operational
integration consists of coordination of schedules and
frequencies so that the service is guaranteed and wait
times are not excessive. Fare integration involves free
or reduced cost transfers, usually through advanced
ticketing systems. Adequate integration requires the
development of information systems to coordinate
services and provide information to the users.
Most cities in developed countries have
advanced integration at all three levels, either through
the consolidation of a single public transport authority
(e.g. Transport for London, UK, or the Land Transport Authority of Singapore), or the coordination
of multiple agencies (Consórcio de Transportes de

Madrid, Spain, or STIF in Paris, France). In contrast,
most metro, light rail and BRT systems in developing countries are still evolving into integrated systems
with the rest of the public transport system. In some
cases, such as Bangkok’s metro, Manila’s light rail
and Quito’s BRT, different lines are not integrated
with one another, requiring passengers to incur
additional fares and walk long distances in order to
connect between stations. This has proved to be a
major disincentive to using the system. Some major
cities have successfully integrated high-capacity public
transport systems with the rest of the public transport systems in their cities. A descriptive list of
these is presented in Table 3.8.

Integration with other elements of the
transport system
Besides the integration between components of the
public transport system, it is important to provide
adequate connectivity with other components of
the urban transport system, such as walking, biking,
taxis, informal transport services, cars and motorcycles. These types of connections complement
public transport systems, as feeder services, to
provide door-to-door connectivity and allow for
expanded coverage of the public transport system.
Walking is usually the most common access
mode to public transport and requires an adequate
environment, with protected, well-lit, signalized and
surfaced sidewalks. Design should consider the needs
of the most vulnerable users: children, the elderly
and people with disabilities. It is important to build
these spaces according to good practices, but perhaps
even more important is to keep such spaces clean
and free of encroachments. Whereas the management
of sidewalks is often outside the jurisdiction of public
transport agencies, adequate coordination with the
responsible agencies is important to ensure safe and
pleasant travel for public transport passengers who
are walking to and from the stations.
In Singapore for instance, adequate facilities
are provided for pedestrians. An inventory of pedestrian facilities in Singapore shows that there are:
491 overhead bridges; 54 pedestrian underpasses;
26 footbridges; 24 kilometres of covered linkways;
and 98,400 street lightings.76 All these provide a
safe and comfortable walking environment, which is
unsurpassed in other Asian cities. Cyclists require
two integration elements: infrastructure and safe
parking. As discussed in Chapter 2, bike travel should
be separated from the walking and the motor vehicle
environment as much as possible – to protect
pedestrians as well as cyclists. Furthermore, bike
lanes should be wide enough to accommodate
bike travel, with strong segregation from the car
traffic.
To ensure usability by cyclists, public transport
vehicles should accommodate bikes inside the trains

Most metro, light
rail and BRT
systems in
developing
countries are still
evolving into
integrated
systems with the
rest of the public
transport system

It is important to
provide adequate
connectivity with
other components
of the urban
transport system,

services, cars and
motorcycles

and develop urban
forms that are

ridership

or buses and/or provide adequate bike parking at
stations. In high-capacity public transport systems,
safe parking at the integration point is recommended.
Other mechanisms to provide last-kilometre
connectivity are taxis, informal transport services and
motor vehicle parking and pick-up or drop-off areas.
In Nairobi, the Kenya Railways Corporation introduced last-mile link buses to convey passengers to
and from the railway station in 2013.77 The last-mile
link shuttle services pick passengers from the
surrounding areas and feed them into the Syokimau
Railway Station, and thereafter drop them off at
various points within the city centre. For this purpose,
the Corporation has contracted a private firm to
provide bus connections for rail transport users
within the city centre.
At important integration points, especially in
the periphery of cities, adequate space is needed for
these mechanisms. This is to ensure that different
types of users are able to connect to the public transport system and avoid using cars to go to the city
centre.

Integration with the built environment
Accompanied by complementary land-use and zoning
policies, high-capacity public transport systems can
encourage compact, pedestrian and public-transport
friendly environments that are integrated into the
surrounding area. Several cities, such as Copenhagen
(Denmark), Singapore and Curitiba (Brazil), have
been able to implement efficient public transport
services and develop urban forms that are highly
conducive to public transport ridership.78 In these
cities, public transport and urban form function in
harmony: either through mixed-use, compact and
accessible development suited for public transport
(also known as transit-oriented development), or
through flexible public transport options suited to
low-density urban development.
Singapore is planned as a public-transportoriented compact city, with high-density residential
and commercial developments around transport
nodes. This improves accessibility to public transport.
Although public bus and train services are provided
on a commercial basis, all forms of public transport

are generally affordable to the public – thus contributing to increased use of public transport and a
reduction in the use of private vehicles. The adequate
integration between public transport and the built
environment makes both the public transport system
and the city successful. High density (combined with
disincentives to private car ownership and use)
increases ridership, while public transport provides
access to dense, accessible, mixed-use urban environments. Consequently, shorter trips can be completed
on foot or bicycle. The result is less vehicle kilometres
travelled and thus lower transport emissions and
fewer traffic accidents.

Quality of service
Quality of service involves several elements as
perceived by the user involving dimensions such as
travel time, reliability, safety and security, comfort
and user information. Travel time includes the doorto-door connectivity, walking to the station, waiting
for the service, travelling on board, transferring
between services and walking to the final destination. Reliability involves the confidence on the
arrival of the service, and the travel time on board.
Safety implies the buses and trains are well
maintained and that passengers would not be exposed
to preventable accidents. Security implies that passengers travel with the realization that they would not
be victims of crime or terrorist attacks. Comfort deals
with several amenities, but mainly with the space
available, or occupancy. User information comes in
many forms to allow the passenger to navigate the
system and be aware of real time information and
contingencies.
The most advanced public transport systems in
the world include all these dimensions of quality to
provide a very attractive alternative to car and
motorcycle use. Many advanced systems in developing countries have high-quality services, but may not
include the first and last leg of the trip (i.e. walking
to and from the station). ‘Universal design’79 – which
is an important aspect of inclusive public transport
systems – is often overlooked.
Cities in developed countries have incorporated
reliability as part of the key performance indicator
metrics. Nevertheless, in developing cities, reliability
is not commonly measured and hence not managed.
Typically, light rail and BRT systems in developing
cities observe train or bus ‘bunching’ (i.e. two or
three vehicles arriving simultaneously at the stage and
gaps between vehicles). This reduces the systems’
capacity and causes high occupancy for some vehicles,
while others have excess space. Advanced control
systems could be used to provide real-time information to the drivers and thereby reduce bunching.
Occupancy levels are the main aspect when
considering comfort. Notably, the occupancy standards in developed and developing countries tend to

differ: four to five standees per square metre vs. six
to seven standees per square metre, respectively. In
general, this is a result of financial considerations,
rather than user acceptance or cultural considerations. Higher occupancy standards mean fewer
vehicles and drivers, and less infrastructure requirements. It also means that the capacity for peak flows
is set artificially high.
As a result, public acceptance of several systems
can suffer.80 For instance, surveys in São Paulo’s
metro (Brazil), Manila’s light rail (the Philippines) and
Bogotá’s BRT (Colombia) indicate that the main user
complaint is overcrowding in trains, buses and
stations. These surveys indicate that the occupancy
standards adopted are not acceptable by users,
irrespective of the public transport mode, and should
be revised. This is important when considering public
transport as an alternative to private motor vehicle
use. In the longer run, the high occupancy standards
may result in more people choosing motorcycles or
cars as they become more affordable due to economic
growth.
User information systems include static and
dynamic information, and are particularly useful for
new users, visitors and for frequent users making
infrequent trips. Modern systems include real-time
information on service arrivals, and voice and visual
announcements for the visually and the hearing
impaired. With the advent of smart wireless technologies this type of information is gradually
becoming available on handheld devices.

Finance
The availability of finance is essential for efficient
urban mobility systems. Conversely, the absence
of finance can constrain the ability of relevant
authorities to implement sustainable high-capacity
public transport options. These issues, which are
addressed in the paragraphs below, are examined in
greater detail with respect to urban mobility systems
in Chapter 8.

Financial risks in public transport project
development
The expansion and maintenance of metros, light rail
or BRT systems require large amounts of funding.
One common issue in developed and developing
countries alike is the tendency to underestimate
time and cost (leading to costly overruns for both),
and overestimate demand during the decisionmaking process. The average cost escalation of
rail, fixed link and road have been estimated at 45,
34 and 21 per cent, respectively;81 in the case of
overestimating demand, 84 per cent of rail projects,
and 50 per cent of road projects have been associated
with inaccuracies larger than 120 per cent.82 This
issue requires substantially improved procedures
during project preparation, with strong institutions

Funding sources

Funding for capital investments in high-capacity
public transport requires the participation of local,
regional and national governments. Several countries
have developed programmes to co-finance capital
investments in public transport, often supported by
multi-lateral development banks and international
technical assistance programmes. It is important to
recognize that the major multi-lateral development
banks – African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Development Bank of Latin America, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank
and the World Bank – pledged US$175 billion
during the Rio+20 Conference to support sustainable transport between 2012 and 2022.83 This fund
will be used to promote all forms of sustainable
transport, including public transport; bicycle and
walking infrastructure; energy-efficient vehicles
and fuels; railways; inland waterways; and road
safety. Additional sources of international funding are
the climate change financial mechanisms, but they
are usually small, as compared with the funding
needs.84
The national governments’ interest in public
transport comes from the importance of cities for the
productivity of the countries, and national energy
security and environmental targets. Other considerations are equity and expanded access, as well as
opportunities for low-income and vulnerable populations living in urban areas. It is also important to
have adequate evaluation procedures to maximize
the benefits of such investments and avoid cost
overruns.85
In addition to transfers from different levels of
government, local authorities require innovative
funding mechanisms to support implementation and
operation of public transport systems beyond the farebox revenues.86 Several potential sources for such
funding are discussed further in Chapter 8.
n

Public transport subsidies

Another important aspect of finance is the issue of
subsidies. Transport economics literature has shown
that public transport subsidies are efficient and
socially worthwhile as public transport involves
several positive externalities (air quality, climate
change, road safety, physical activity). Thus, the
provision of subsidies to encourage operators to
lower their existing fares and/or expand their existing
frequencies is socially desirable.87 The majority of the
social benefits accrue from the ‘Mohring effect’,88
which indicates that subsidies increase ridership,
and ridership increase engenders higher service frequencies, and the higher frequencies reduce the

average waiting times at public transport stops.
Hence, subsidies could be justified because of the
scale economies conferred on riders. Nevertheless,
subsidies need adequate management for them to
be targeted towards service improvements and
serving the needs of vulnerable populations (low
income, elderly, handicapped). Unmanaged subsidies
may result in inefficiencies, such as excessive
overheads, large number of operators and drivers, and
high maintenance costs.89

Institutions
Urban transport involves multiple institutions and
levels of government that are not always well
coordinated. Lack of coordination results in several
issues such as the lack of integration among public
transport components, other transport modes and the
built environment. Very often, the agencies responsible for metros, light rail or BRTs are only responsible
for their respective mode, with minimal (if any)
coordination with other components of the urban
transport system. A second institutional issue is the
lack of technical and managerial capacity. Many
agencies in developing countries are not able to
retain qualified personnel to plan, implement and
manage the complexity of public transport projects.
There is an urgent need to upgrade the technical
capacity through training and professional development programmes. The institutional and governance
dimensions of sustainable urban mobility systems are
discussed further in Chapter 9.
Significant opportunities exist to enhance
technical and managerial capacity, through direct
exchanges among peer institutions and benchmarking. Some examples of these efforts include:
• Nova – a programme of international railway
benchmarking, made up of a consortium of
medium sized metro systems from around the
world: Bangkok (Thailand), Barcelona (Spain),
Buenos Aires (Argentina), Brussels (Belgium),
Delhi (India), Istanbul (Turkey), Lisbon (Portugal),
Montréal (Canada), Naples (Italy), Newcastle (UK),
Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Singapore, Toronto
(Canada) and Sydney (Australia). The four main
objectives of Nova are: to build measures to
establish metro best practice; to provide
comparative information both for the metro board
and the government; to introduce a system of
measures for management; and to prioritize areas
for improvement.90
• CoMET – a programme of international railway
benchmarking, made up of a consortium of large
metro systems from around the world: Beijing
(China), Berlin (Germany), Guangzhou (China),
Hong Kong (China), London (UK), Madrid (Spain),
Mexico City (Mexico), Moscow (Russia), New
York (US), Paris (France), Santiago (Chile), São

Paulo (Brazil), Shanghai (China) and Taipei
(China). Just like Nova, the four main objectives
of CoMET are: to build measures to establish
metro best practice; to provide comparative
information both for the metro board and the
government; to introduce a system of measures
for management; and to prioritize areas for
improvement.91
• The International Bus Benchmarking Group
(IBBG) – a programme of urban bus operations
benchmarking, made up of medium and large bus
organizations located around the world: Barcelona
(Spain), Brussels (Belgium), Dublin (Ireland),
Istanbul (Turkey), Lisbon (Portugal), London (UK),
Montréal (Canada), New York (US), Paris (France),
Seattle (US), Singapore, Sydney (Australia) and
Vancouver (Canada). IBBG was established in
2004 to provide a confidential forum to share
experiences, compare performance, identify best
practices and learn from one another in order for
member organizations to improve performance.92
• SIBRT – whose mission is to cooperate and create
a synergy for the promotion, consolidation and
strengthening of BRT and integrated transport
systems, so that they become paradigms for the
future of mobility in Latin America and the world,
and to contribute effectively to improve the quality
of urban life.93
Additional exchanges are organized through industrial
associations such as the International Association of
Public Transport (global),94 the American Public
Transportation Association (US),95 Canadian Urban
Transit Association (Canada),96 and Associação
Nacional de Transportes Públicos (Brazil).97

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR
POLICY
This chapter has presented empirical evidence of the
trends and conditions as well as challenges with
respect to the role of high-capacity public transport
systems worldwide. These systems play important
social, economic and environmental roles in terms
of facilitating more efficient urban mobility systems
and sustainable urban development patterns. Such
high-capacity public transport systems are primarily
appropriate for large and dense urban agglomerations, and serve as important parts of integrated
public transport systems. Accordingly, they should
be designed to provide a competitive and viable
alternative to private cars and motorcycles.
Globally, metro systems have an average of 112
million passengers per day. Asian cities account for

46 per cent of global ridership, followed by European
cities with 34 per cent of global ridership. As of 2013,
there are only two African cities with metro systems.
Ridership on light rail systems is significantly lower,
although there are some 400 light rail and tram
systems in operation worldwide. Most of these are
found in Europe and the US, although the two light
rail systems with the highest number of passengers
are both located in Asia.
As of mid-2013, there were 156 cities worldwide
with BRT system. The total ridership for BRT, which
is about 26 million passengers per day, is less than
a quarter of that of metro systems. Most BRT systems
are located in developing countries, particularly in
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia.
Metro, light rail and BRT systems have different
characteristics, each with its benefits and drawbacks.
This report calls for an advanced evaluation of the
costs and benefits of high-capacity public transport
systems, prior to their implementation. It is also
important to avoid endless discussions about alternatives, as the worst case scenario is ‘to-do-nothing’.
A major issue relating to the successful implementation of high-capacity public transport systems
is an accurate understanding of the requirements and
perceptions of its potential users. In order to ensure
maximum ridership on metro, light rail and BRT
systems, these need to be designed and implemented
in a manner that meets the aspirations of potential
riders.
Integration is important for public transport
systems to be efficient and sustainable. The most
efficient systems are those that have achieved route
integration; integration with other public transport
systems; integration with private motorized transport (including through encouraging drivers of private
cars to park outside the city centre and use public
transport for parts of their daily commute); integration with non-motorized modes (through easy
access for pedestrians and/or bicycle parking and
allowing bicycles onto public transport vehicles);
and fare integration: allowing users to travel
throughout the urban public transport system on a
single ticket, or at reduced rates when switching
between operators and/or lines. Integration also
includes the built environment dimension: dense,
mixed-use and accessible urban forms enhance ridership and vice versa.
Technical inadequacies in the construction of
public transport systems, such as ramps, gaps, steps
or waiting areas, represent significant challenges for
vulnerable groups. Many high-capacity public transport systems are also characterized by real or
perceived security risks. These challenges and risks
often lead to reduced ridership and exclusion of many
potential users, especially women, children, the
elderly, disabled and minorities.

URBAN GOODS
TRANSPORT

Urban goods transport, also known as urban freight
distribution, concerns a vast range of activities
insuring an adequate level of service for a variety of
urban supply chains. While cities have always been
important producers and consumers of goods
historically, much of these activities were taking
place in proximity to major transport terminals, with
limited quantities of freight entering the city itself.
The functional specialization of cities, the global
division of production, the emergence of intermodal
terminals, the rise of service activities, global consumerism, as well as increasing standards of living
are all correlated with an increased demand for
urban goods transport in cities. This is characterized
by a higher frequency of deliveries, and larger
quantities of freight shipments coming from, bound
to or transiting through urban areas. The scale,
intensity and complexity of urban goods transport
necessitate additional forms of organization and
management in many large cities, which is the realm
of city logistics. City logistics concerns the means to
enable goods transport in urban areas by improving
the efficiency of urban freight transportation and
mitigating the environmental and social impacts.
The need for city logistics is often a derived
outcome of the new demands imposed by global
supply chains on regional and urban landscapes.1
Since most of the goods consumed in cities originate
from outside locations, urban goods transport is
commonly referred to as the ‘last mile’ along a supply
chain. Urban goods transport is thus concerned with
establishing an effective interface between the
regional or global realms of freight transport and
the last mile of urban freight distribution. While maritime shipping, air cargo or rail are the privileged
modes for long-distance goods transport, the vehicle,
particularly the truck, remains the dominant urban
mode as it is perceived to be the most suitable to
service specific origins and destinations within the
complex urban grid of streets and highways. This last
mile requires a shift to different distribution strategies
more suitable to an urban context, often resulting

in congestion, delays and additional costs proportionally higher than the distance concerned.
The sustainability of cities cannot be reviewed
without due consideration to the role of goods
transport.2 Indeed, while a city can be perceived as
an economic, social, political and cultural entity,
urban freight distribution underlines the physical and
managerial activities necessary to support all of the
above. However, compared to passenger transport,
urban freight distribution has to a large extent been
neglected by urban transport policy-makers. Yet, it
is extremely important for the social and economic
viability of urban areas and has widespread ramifications for the environment, transport infrastructures
and overall trends in mobility. The sector is also faced
with a number of challenges such as congestion,
parking for deliveries and reverse logistics (e.g.
recycling and garbage collection).3
This chapter thus reviews the trends and
conditions of goods transport in urban areas, both
within the formal and informal sectors. It outlines
the fundamental contribution of goods transport for
urban life, and points to the externalities generated
by the sector. The elaboration of goods transport processes, in both developed and developing countries,
sheds light on the contrasts and similarities across
countries. Importantly also, the chapter shows how
goods movement interacts with, and is shaped by,
the urban context in quite specific ways.

URBAN GOODS TRANSPORT:
KEY COMPONENTS AND
ACTORS
Urban goods transport, as it relates to cities and their
populations, is the set of all activities ensuring that
their material demands are satisfied. The focus is on
the city as a place of production, distribution and
consumption of material goods, but also the handling of waste as an outcome of these activities.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Throughout history, cities have had to make provisions for distributing and storing goods to their
populations. Commercial areas, including warehouses, tended to be located directly adjacent to
facilities such as ports and main arterials. The
industrial revolution and later suburbanization
offered an extended range of options in the location
of activities supporting urban freight distribution.
These included rail yards and highway interchanges.
The situation became inherently more complex as
the intensity and variety of urban goods transport
services increased. This in turn made the importance of goods transport more salient, to the point
that concerted approaches were developed that led
to the emergence of city logistics.
While the functions of production (e.g. manufacturing) and consumption (e.g. retailing) remain
prominent forms of urban goods transport, globalization has enabled the expansion of the distribution
sector as a more prevalent element of the urban
landscape, with facilities such as terminals and
distribution centres. City logistics have experienced
significant changes, particularly with the concept of
lean management, where demand-based supplychain management has enabled a better management of inventories and less storage requirements.
Under such circumstances, most of the inventory
is in transit using transport modes and terminals as
‘mobile warehouses’; this inventory is consuming
valuable urban space either as land use or as vehicles
circulating in the urban transport system.
Most of the early city logistics projects were
undertaken in Japan and Western Europe4 (e.g.
Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK) as cities in these countries were
more constrained by the lack of available land, and
had well-established urban planning traditions. The
approach was then adopted in other parts of the

world, with the growing recognition that the metropolitan area should also be considered as a freight
planning unit. Still, and in spite of a growing global
awareness, the focus on urban goods transport
remains limited, partially due to an enduring bias in
urban planning concerning freight issues (Box 4.1).
An important technological change relates to
intermodal transportation, which has considerably
improved the capacity and efficiency of moving freight
between modes such as maritime, rail and road.
Of particular relevance is containerization, which has
shaped transportation systems in a fundamental
way by providing a load unit that can be handled
almost everywhere, and by a variety of modes.5 More
recently, the application of new information and
communication technologies for improving the overall
management of freight distribution has received
attention.

Components of urban goods transport
A city is provisioned by hundreds of supply chains
servicing a wide array of economic sectors including
grocery stores, retail, restaurants, office supplies, raw
materials and parts (for manufacturing), construction
materials and wastes. Depending on the circumstances, goods transport accounts for 10 to 15 per
cent of vehicle equivalent kilometres travelled in
urban areas, 2 to 5 per cent of the employed urban
workforce, and 3 to 5 per cent of urban land use. A
city not only receives goods but also ships them: some
20 to 25 per cent of truck-kilometres in urban areas
are outgoing freight, 40 to 50 per cent are incoming
freight, and the rest both originates from and is
delivered within the city.6
There are three main components of city
logistics: the modes that carry the freight, the infrastructures supporting freight flows and the operations

Box 4.1 Urban planning and freight distribution
The consideration of freight distribution within urban planning
remains limited, leading to substantial biases in the analysis of
urban mobility, which overly focuses on passenger issues.
The main factors behind this oversight can be attributed to the
following:
•

•

•

Freight distribution is an activity predominantly controlled
and operated by private interests, with limited oversight
from the public sector. Thus, the public sector tends to
have only minimal understanding about the commercial
dynamics of freight distribution.
Accordingly, the public sector tends to have direct control
and oversight over public transport systems with planning
endeavours focusing on these issues.
Freight distribution is a profit-seeking activity (making
goods available to customers), while public transport is

•

•

more about maximizing utility (providing accessibility).
The planning and operational objectives of stakeholders,
including their mentality, are therefore different.
There is a scale mismatch in the understanding of
urban mobility, since passenger flows are
predominantly the outcome of local processes (e.g.
commuting), while freight flows reflect a dynamic often
being driven by processes taking place at the global
level (global supply chains).
Urban transportation and mobility in academic and
professional programmes mostly reflect the realm of
public engagement, with freight issues remaining a
marginal component. Programmes tend to focus on
passengers, and planners receive limited exposure to
freight issues in their training.

Urban Goods Transport

Freight can be handled commercially by two types
of actors: private and common carriers. For private
carriage, freight is carried out by cargo owners
(manufacturers or retailers) with their own employees
and fleet, or by subcontracting to an independent
carrier with its own vehicles. A common carrier sells
its services to any customer on a contractual basis
and will often consolidate their cargo and deliveries.
There is a significant geographical variation in the role
of private and common carriers in urban goods
transport. While in developed countries private and
common carriers tend to account for an equal share
of urban deliveries, in developing countries private
carriers tend to be dominant. This is reflective of an
urban freight distribution market that is not well
developed and assumed in part by an informal sector
using motorized and non-motorized means.
The global production network concerns an
array of manufacturing activities mostly organized by
multi-national corporations in search of comparative

advantages. This is associated with a growth in
international trade, where cities assume the function
of production zones for parts and finished goods
bound to global markets. Intermodal terminals are
the interfacing means to access the global distribution
network. This network supports international trade
that circulates over a global network of intermodal
terminals linked by modes such as maritime shipping, air freight and for shorter distances by rail
and trucking. In this frame, cities act as distribution
nodes with their major port, airport and rail terminal
facilities. In many instances, a city will play the role
of a gateway granting access to a regional freight
distribution system, implying that freight distribution
will have a spatial imprint well above one justified
by the level of urban consumption.
The global urban network is reflective of the
intensity of material consumption, since from a
material standpoint the main function of cities is to
act as points of final consumption. The multitude of
actors and supply chain concerned requires a growing
level of organization and management of urban
freight distribution. This is particularly problematic
since cities are highly constrained areas, with a
limited amount of space available for circulation,
deliveries and warehousing. However, the differences
between cities in developing and developed countries
remain salient, particularly over freight flows.
In terms of stakeholders of commercial goods
transport in urban areas, it is possible to identify
four general groups that are shaping urban freight
distribution: cargo owners (e.g. retailers, manu-

related to their organization and management (Figure
4.1). Each component has subcomponents with their
own characteristics and constraints. For instance,
transport terminals, roads and distribution centres
are infrastructure subcomponents of city logistics.
The same applies to scheduling, routing, parking
and loading/unloading, which are operational subcomponents.
While trucks remain the dominant mode
supporting city logistics, they face constraints mainly
related to congestion and environmental externalities.
This is in spite of the prominence that road infrastructure takes over urban land use, as well as parking and unloading (or loading) difficulties at the
points of final delivery. The balance in the relative
importance of the depicted subcomponents appears
to be unsustainable in a growing number of urban
areas. A major challenge for city logistics is therefore a rebalancing where alternative modes (such
as electric vehicles) and infrastructure (such as local
freight stations), improved by novel forms of operations, would play a more prominent role. Obviously,
the nature and extent of this rebalancing is city
specific.
City logistics, as a last-mile distributional strategy, can take many forms depending on the concerned supply chains, as well as the urban setting in
which it takes place. It involves two main functional
classes: the first concerning consumer-related distribution and second producer-related distribution.
Independent retailing, chain retailing, food deliveries
and parcel and home deliveries constitute consumerrelated distribution while producer-related distribution involves construction sites, waste collection and
disposal, industrial and terminal haulage.

facturers, wholesalers); residents; distributors (mostly
carriers, third party logistics companies and freight
forwarders); and planners and regulators. The relations between the cargo owners who provide goods
and the residents who consume them, with distributors acting on the cargo owners’ behalf, are particularly important as cargo owners and distributors
strive to fulfil consumers’ needs. Planners and regulators try to set rules under which urban freight
distribution takes place, with the multi-dimensional
aim of satisfying their constituents as well as commercial, transport and distribution interests. Each
stakeholder has its own objectives, and while there
may be inherent conflicts between stakeholders,
under normal circumstances the relations tend to
be on the neutral side. However, when a challenge
in city logistics requiring an intervention from
either a public or private stakeholder emerges, the
relationships between stakeholders are likely to
change, which can lead to four possible outcomes
(Figure 4.2):

• Competition. Standard relationships between
private shippers and freight forwarders as they bid
to access urban real estate and facilities for their
operations. Freight forwarders compete to attract
and retain customers over their freight distribution
services. Commercial and residential developers
are also competing within the land-use zoning
framework for real estate projects.
• Coopetition. A specific form of collaboration
between private stakeholders, particularly when
a stakeholder is unable to individually address
an issue or is incited to do so by regulation. While
they may compete for attracting and retaining
customers, freight forwarders could be involved
in shared operations. Activities related to the
consolidation of urban freight distribution are
particularly prone to coopetition with shared
facilities (e.g. urban distribution centres) or
deliveries (e.g. shippers pooling their demand to
negotiate better terms with a freight forwarder).

• Conflicts. Due to the scarcity of space, as well
as the density and the complexity of the urban
landscape, conflicts between stakeholders are
common. These conflicts arise when the externalities of existing or proposed projects imposed
by urban freight distribution on local communities are judged to be unacceptable by residents,
planners and regulators. Sometimes conflicts arise
between the residents and planners over specific
issues triggering classic NIMBY (not-in-mybackyard) responses. Legal recourse is attempted
to stop a development project (e.g. a new distribution centre) or to more strictly regulate a freight
activity (e.g. access to a commercial district).
• Cooperation. Usually achieved when additional
mitigation strategies are added to a project
(change in design) or to modes of operation. It is
agreed by some form of consensus that the
existing capacity is to be used and shared more
rationally. Public–private partnerships are examples where private goals and public interests can
be accommodated.7

Cities are concomitantly areas of production,
distribution and consumption. The growth in global
trade reflects growing levels of production and
consumption taking place in urban areas. While
specific figures are not readily found, it can be
assumed that most of global trade either originates
in, transits through, or is bound to, an urban area.
The associated growth in global distribution has
reinforced the role of gateway cities, nodes
interfacing with global economic processes, mostly
through ports and airport terminals (Box 4.2).
The city is also increasingly transnational.
Depending on the economic and geographical context, some cities (such as London, UK; New York,
US; Paris, France; and Tokyo, Japan) have a pronounced tertiary function (finance, administration,
culture), implying that consumption accounts for the
main share of the total goods being handled, with
the functions of production and distribution assuming
a more marginal role. Other cities (such as Bangkok,
Thailand; Busan, Republic of Korea; Guangzhou and
Shanghai, China) have emerged as manufacturing
centres where production assumes the dominant
share of goods flows. With the increasing use of the
container and the growth of long-distance trade,
several cities act as intermediaries for the goods flows
bound to large market areas. For instance, gateway
cities often fulfil the material requirements of whole
regions by being a point of freight transit and
distribution to service inland destinations.
Inasmuch as a majority of urban inhabitants do
not interact with freight facilities or have little

Box 4.2 Gateway cities and global distribution
cent of the world’s containerized and air freight traffic is in
this region. Expanding this gateway to the Pearl River
Delta (with Guangzhou), which can be considered a megaurban region (Box 5.11), causes this share to reach 16.7
per cent. For Europe, the Rhine/Scheldt delta (from
Amsterdam to Brussels) accounts for 7.5 per cent of the
global containerized and air freight volume. The most
important North American gateway system is the Los
Angeles/Long Beach system. Some of the gateways are
dominantly hubs transhipping freight from one system of
circulation to the other, such as Colombo (Sri Lanka),
Dubai (United Arab Emirates) or Singapore.

A gateway city is a pivotal point for the entrance and exit of
goods in a region, a country or a continent. The global system
of freight distribution is articulated by major gateway cities,
often composed of a cluster of ports and airports within a
metropolitan area. Altogether, the 39 largest gateway cities
accounted for 90 per cent of the global containerized and air
freight volumes (Figure 4.3). This underlines their fundamental
importance in the handling of the world’s trade and as
intermediary (or final) locations within global distribution
systems.
There is a substantial concentration of freight activity
along the Tokyo–Singapore corridor in Asia. The world’s
largest gateway region is Hong Kong–Shenzhen; 14.8 per

awareness of their existence, these play a fundamental
role in the urban economy or a city’s welfare. Urban
freight activities support the supply chains in urban
areas and there is a clear link between these activities
and the level of economic development of cities as
highlighted below. The following subsection also
points out areas of convergence between the developed and developing countries with respect to urban
goods transport, as well as describing key areas of
divergence as dictated by the level of economic
development priorities, among other factors.

Developed countries
The material intensiveness of urban freight distribution depends on local economic, geographic
and cultural characteristics.8 It is not surprising
that cities in developed countries with high standards
of living are coping with a high intensity of urban
goods transport. Evidence from Europe suggests that
a high-income city generates about one delivery or
pickup per job per week, 300 to 400 truck trips per
1000 people per day, and 30 to 50 tonnes of goods
per person per year.9

also very active in

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

However, conditions vary significantly based
upon local characteristics and the role cities play in
global freight distribution. For example, Chicago
has been preoccupied with maintaining its role as a
major rail hub for North America, and is thus primarily
concerned with rail freight transport between the
numerous rail terminals and large distribution centres
located within its metropolitan area, many of which
are serviced by trucks.10 Los Angeles as a gateway
city to North America is primarily concerned with
air pollution, and thus targets truck transport associated with port terminals and nearby major importbased distribution centres.11 Paris, France, is concerned with limiting the environmental footprint of
freight distribution in order to improve the quality
of life of its residents and maintain its role as one of
the world’s leading cultural and tourism hubs.

Developing countries
The conditions in which urban goods transport takes
place in developing countries show an impressive
diversity. Several segments of economic activity have
a high level of integration to global economic processes and their related freight distribution. Thus, it
is not surprising to find state-of-the-art transport
facilities such as port terminals, airports and distribution centres in developing countries. This aspect of
city logistics is therefore on par with those of developed countries as the same modes, technologies and
management techniques are used.
However, in addition to formal goods transport,
an informal sector – that may rely on less advanced
modes and management techniques – is also very
active in supplying the needs of lower-income groups.
These may include motorized means such as twowheelers, and more significantly, non-motorized

forms of goods transport (Box 4.3). While several
basic consumption goods (apparel, electronic goods,
batteries, etc.) enter a country through formal supply
chains, a majority enter through informal distribution
channels. The informal sector provides crucial city
logistics services in developing countries, but tends
to be more labour intensive, thus increasing the risk
of damage, theft or injuries.
The differences between formal and informal
activities are also linked to gender and age. While
workers involved in formal forms of transportation,
such as delivery truck drivers, are predominantly
male, retail workers dealing with the last segment
of city logistics are predominantly female. In the leastdeveloped countries, the transportation burden of
household needs, such as fuel, water and food,
and many other petty trades, is mainly assumed by
women.12 However, urban goods transport can
also be a source of income, albeit subject to risks,
for the urban poor and other lower-income groups.
For children and teenagers, informal freight distribution is a common source of income, before attaining
driving age.13
As in developed countries, the conditions and
priorities in developing countries substantially
diverge. For instance, Mexico City is coping with
a complex mix of urban growth, rising consumption levels, congestion and environmental externalities where both modern and informal forms of city
logistics are present (Box 4.4). With its function
as a major transport hub supporting China’s exportoriented economic strategies, Shanghai has become
the largest cargo port in the world, with advanced
logistics capabilities. This highlights the contrast
between city logistics of the modern coastal cities
of China, in comparison to a countryside that is much
less integrated.

In Delhi, India motorized tricycles haul small loads requiring
frequent delivery stops, and handle around 60 per cent of
intra-city goods movement, transporting as much as a 5-tonne
truck in a day via multiple trips. As well as courier services,
deliveries of groceries, furniture, electronics, etc. are
increasingly made by auto-rickshaws, vans and tricycles, while
larger informal carriers – such as shared taxis, minibuses and
light vans are used for longer distances. In most of South Asia,
trip-chains involve intermodal connections between microvehicles and large-load haulers at railway stations, bus depots,
distribution centres, etc. Although efficient and affordable, the
limited income earned by indigenous goods haulers
undermines capital investment in more efficient vehicles.
Access to credit can thus be an important factor for improving
city logistics in developing economies.

Non-motorized transport is also frequently used for
goods delivery in African cities, due to it being cheap and
readily available. In Mumbai, India, about 200,000 tiffin lunch
boxes are delivered daily by a combination of non-motorized
means, thereby generating employment for those involved.
Forms of NMT transport for goods in African cities include
three-wheel platform rickshaws (gudrum matatu in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania), waste cart pushers (kayabola) in Accra,
Ghana, and animal-drawn carts in South African low-income
townships for waste picking, scrap metal haulage and coal
delivery.

Box 4.4 Relationships between formal and informal city logistics, Mexico City
Mexico City, with a population of 20 million, typifies very large
and fast-growing metropolises of emerging economies. The
city is a logistics gateway of Latin America where many
regional headquarters of multi-national companies and
associated advanced services are located. It also accounts for a
third of the country’s manufacturing output. The informal
sector is also a significant feature of Mexico City’s economy,
with a high number of very small businesses in operation. As
an enormous urban centre whose activities and population
generate a high and diversified demand for freight, its logistics
features relate to both formal and informal processes.
The part of goods transport that is formal (and
documented) represents about 400 million tonnes annually,
and is mostly based on road transportation. The main and
growing mode of freight supply is trucking, whose flows and
characteristics are well surveyed. Despite recent private
investments, congestion, the lack of space for loading and
unloading, regulatory complexity (e.g. weight and access

GOODS TRANSPORT IN AN
URBAN CONTEXT
Goods transport systems are often specific to distinct
urban built environments, implying that no city is
alike with respect to the nature and challenges of its
city logistics. In addition to broader factors shaping
the conditions of urban goods transport such as
geographical settings, history, levels of economic
development and government policies, the urban
context shapes goods transport trends in specific
ways.
Urban density is closely associated with patterns of goods transport. While cities in developing
countries tend to have higher densities than cities
in developed countries, higher income levels in
developed countries increase the generation of freight
per density level.14 High-density areas are associated with high absolute consumption levels, but
adequately supplying such needs is not without challenges. This tends to be paradoxical, as high densities
are commonly advocated as sustainable urban development goals. However, high urban densities can also
result in congestion if mass forms of transportation
(i.e. public transport) are not adequately provided.
Still, high density provides additional opportunities
to consolidate deliveries and use alternative modes.
The distribution of the density in relation to
the street layout, or urban spatial structure, also
influences goods transport. Many urban areas that
were established before motorization have a street
layout that is not suitable for goods transport, with
narrow and sinuous streets. Up to some density
levels, a motorized and grid-like street layout provides
an efficient setting for urban deliveries but comes

restrictions), public corruption, the risk of theft and the lack of
safety, there are widespread concerns for freight distribution
in the city. Congestion is an acute issue, as it can take up to
four hours for trucks to cross the city. As a consequence,
many companies are moving their logistics facilities to
suburban areas, where several extensive logistics clusters have
grown to accommodate distribution centres and private
logistics facilities. Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure in
Mexico City leads to poor regional accessibility, which hinders
market extension and international integration, and keeps
logistic costs high.
At the same time, informal means of transportation
(foot, wheelbarrows, bikes, motorbikes) represent a significant
share of freight transport, but are difficult to record. All these
features make Mexico City a good example of the challenges
facing urban freight management in very large cities in
emerging economies.

with externalities such as high energy consumption,
noise and emission of pollutants.
The urban land-use structure relates to the
organization of economic activities, which can be
centralized, decentralized, clustered or dispersed, and
impacts upon goods transport. Therefore, a decentralized and dispersed land-use structure is thus
associated with a disorganized urban goods transport
system, as it becomes problematic to reconcile origins
and destinations in urban interactions. For instance,
delivering the same quantity of goods in a decentralized and dispersed land-use setting generally involves
longer trips and more frequent stops than in a
centralized and clustered setting.
The city scale in terms of population size may
also influence urban goods transport trends. While
there is no formal methodology to make such an
assessment, empirical evidence in the US underlines
that congestion starts to be a recurring issue once a
threshold of about 1 million inhabitants is reached.15
This obviously concerns cities having a high level of
motorization, thus applying this threshold to a range
of cities around the world is problematic, since
each city has unique local conditions that influence
the nature and intensity of congestion, such as the
share of public-transport use and land-use density.
For instance, Antwerp (Belgium) with a population
of nearly a million appears to be well below the congestion threshold, but this overlooks the fact that it
is one of Europe’s main port cities. The amount of
truck-based freight circulating within the metropolitan area, particularly on the ring roads, is well
above any city of a similar size.
Freight distribution, as an activity fundamental
to urban life, consumes a substantial amount of

space in urban areas and competes with other
activities for the use of land and infrastructure. Land
requirements for urban goods transport are significant
as both transport modes and terminals consume
space for the setting of their respective infrastructures.16 Industrial land uses are also complementary
to city logistics, as they are important generators and
attractors of freight flows. Additionally, there are
rights of way, mainly roads, that are often shared
between goods and passenger transport.
The land used for freight infrastructure can be
particularly extensive in metropolitan areas that are
points of convergence for global material flows, and
involve several stakeholders (Table 4.1). However,
the amount of land devoted to freight is not necessarily related to the size or the level of consumption
in a city. Some cities (such as Dalian and Ningbo,
China) focus on production such as export-oriented
economic development zones, while other cities
(such as Singapore; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Los
Angeles, US; and Panama City, Panama) are major
gateways or hubs managing regional systems of
freight circulation.
Freight facilities such as intermodal terminals
and distribution centres tend to be highly capital
intensive and mechanized. The sections below highlight how the growing consumption of land by these
facilities has led to new forms of dislocation within
urban areas, in terms of terminal and distribution

facilities. The discussion also describes the tendency
for spatial de-concentration of these facilities in areas
where there is severe land pressure.

Terminal facilities
Intermodal transportation places tremendous pressure on the land in metropolitan areas, particularly
those with container terminals and their ancillary
facilities (e.g. access ramps, container and chassis
storage). The global urban footprint is estimated to
account for 658,760 square kilometres, about 0.51
per cent of the total global land area.17 A sample of
the world’s 453 largest container port terminal
facilities reveals that they jointly account for 230.7
square kilometres of land take (0.035 per cent of the
total urban area).18 Although this figure represents
a very small share of urban land use, container port
terminal facilities occupy prime waterfront real estate,
which is a scarce resource in coastal areas. The construction of new port facilities now requires extensive
land reclamation projects as suitable sites are no
longer readily available. For instance, the construction
of the Maasvlatke II port terminal in Rotterdam
(Netherlands) or the Yangshan container port near
Shanghai (China) are examples of the massive land
reclamation demands that new port terminal facilities
require. The true transportation land take for freight
distribution is difficult to assess as many infrastruc-

tures, such as roads and airports, are mainly used for
passenger transport and can be considered as shared
facilities.
Wherever there is an intermodal facility, there
is a tendency to have an agglomeration of distribution
facilities. This is particularly the case for large airports
located near clusters of distribution centres and
third-party logistics services providers; air freight
being a time sensitive endeavour requiring supply
chain managers to be in proximity. As a result, a new
urban form, the ‘aerotropolis’ is taking shape around
major airports.19 It contains an inner zone of distribution centres, logistics complexes and just-in-time
manufacturers. In addition, it includes a ring of office
parks, hotels, restaurants and convention centres,
and then a largely residential periphery, which serves
as the home to those who work in the aerotropolis.
High-capacity highways and rail lines provide access
to the rest of the metropolitan area, within which
an aerotropolis is set. These activities are competing
at a global level, which commonly implies that the
economy of the aerotropolis tends to be linked more
to global processes than to regional ones. Dubai,
United Arab Emirates, may be the best example of
a planned aerotropolis, but several Asian airports
(such as such as Bangkok, Thailand; Singapore; and
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) have initiated this type of
development. A few examples can also be found in
the US and Europe, including Dallas-Fort Worth (US)
and Schiphol (Netherlands).

Distribution facilities
Distribution land requirements include various
facilities to hold freight in bulk storage facilities (e.g.
oil reservoirs or grain silos) and warehousing facilities
for break-bulk (e.g. consumer goods in containers).
Distribution centres consume a lot of space, as a
wide array of added-value activities are performed
on a one floor design, including consolidation and
deconsolidation, cross-docking and storage. The last
of these can also require specialized facilities, such
as cold storage for supporting urban food distribution.
It was estimated that for England and Wales alone,
warehousing was accounting for 0.8 per cent of nonagricultural and forestry land.20
The spatial distribution of industrial, commercial and logistics facilities has a direct impact on the
number of vehicle-kilometres, and the average trip
length that will be necessary to reach stores, industries and households. In cities such as Chicago, US,
which emerged after the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, most of the freight-related activities such as industries, warehouses and terminals
were located in close proximity to the central business district. A majority (more than two-thirds, in
the case of European cities) of all shipments to and
from urban areas are organized from terminals
and distribution centres. As a result, a contemporary

pattern where logistics are specialized and separated
from other urban activities has emerged.
Global supply chains rely on novel forms of
urban land use such as the logistics zone, which is
a planned area entirely devoted to freight distribution.
While in the past, the agglomeration of freight distribution activities would organically take place where
land was available, and where (road) accessibility was
suitable, logistics zones are often set by large transnational real estate promoters and some, labelled
as ‘freight villages’, can include ancillary activities
such as hotels, convention centres and restaurants.
In some developing countries (Brazil, Malaysia), the
export-oriented free trade zone has become a city
within the city, with a value proposition based on
foreign investments and access to global markets
through port and airport facilities. China, with its
special economic zones, epitomizes this type of
development, which sheds light on Chinese urbanization processes along its coastal areas. In the last
30 years, employment opportunities in special economic zones such as Shenzhen (China), were a
strong driver behind the migration of 100 to 140
million people from inland provinces.21

Logistics sprawl
Another key trend is logistics sprawl, or the spatial
de-concentration of logistics facilities in metropolitan
areas. Confronted with the severe land pressure in
large cities, as well as with the large urban renewal
projects that took place during the 1960s and 1970s,
logistics and transport companies began to follow
centrifugal locational patterns (Box 4.5). The physical
moves were achieved through small-scale changes in
their spatial organization, with the closing of urban
distribution centres and the opening of new ones in
the periphery. Greater land requirements and better
accessibility to highways were two of the main driving
forces.
While it results in the creation of new spaces,
better fitting the functional and operational characteristics of freight distribution, logistics sprawl also
creates challenges. With globalization, large terminal
and warehousing facilities have generated demands
for land to support urban goods distribution, but also
conflicts and dislocations. Another impact of logistics
sprawl concerns the patterns and the modes of
commuting. Due to their low density and suburban
settings, logistics zones are generally not well serviced
by public transport and contribute to automobile
dependency.
The spatial structure of metropolitan areas
has led to forms of city logistics that seek to provide
the most suitable distribution strategy, based upon
the level of density. While higher density levels are
associated with congestion and difficulties for urban
deliveries, they also offer additional opportunities
for alternative forms of urban distribution (Box 4.6).

Box 4.5 Logistics sprawl, Paris, France
An important feature of urban and regional freight
transportation is referred to as ‘logistics sprawl’; the
relocation of freight facilities and distribution centres in
remote suburban areas. During the 1970s and 1980s, terminals
that were used for freight transport and logistics activities in
Paris relocated to outlying municipalities (Figure 4.4).
However, the economic activities have not dispersed as much
as logistics facilities. This has increased distances for delivery
trucks to reach destinations, adding a lot of vehicle-kilometres
to the regional traffic.

Paris can be considered one of the most active European cities
in the field of urban freight management. The city-region has a
population of 11 million, and is among the largest and most
economically developed metropolitan areas in the world. Ilede-France is an important logistics hub, concentrating 17
million square metres of warehouses, which represents a
fourth of the French warehousing market. Paris has a very high
commercial density; it hosts many independent retailers and
food stores, and a high proportion of hotels, cafés and
restaurants, due to Paris’ role as one of the world’s most
popular tourist destinations.

Box 4.6 Land use and forms of city logistics
A metropolitan area can be serviced through several freight
distribution strategies that vary in scope depending on the
level of urban density.a An urban freight distribution strategy
that is frequently used in high and low urban densities alike is
illustrated in Figure 4.5 and constitutes the following three
elements:
•

•

Urban logistics zones try to rationalize the multiplication
of freight distribution transport, as well as their longer
distances, by providing space in relative proximity to
central areas. They are commonly developed over
brownfield sites that can provide additional benefit if
adjacent (co-located) to existing port, airport or rail
terminal facilities. Users have the opportunity to
consolidate their urban deliveries.
Urban freight distribution centres are shared facilities
interfacing with a set of distribution centres, each being

•

connected to their respective supply chains.b Thus, a wide
array of supply chains can achieve a better efficiency within
the central city. In this case, the last mile’ is assumed by
shared vehicles operating on the behalf of the urban freight
distribution centre’s customers. On some occasions, urban
freight distribution centres can combine several activities
within the same facility, such as office and retail functions,
to maximize revenue generation.
Urban freight stations are small facilities where cargo can
be dropped and picked up. A common problem in parcel
delivery or pickup is that it requires both the customer
and the carrier to be available at the same time and
location. Urban freight stations near highly frequented
locations offer the highest proximity level to customers,
and can therefore mitigate the matching issue between the
delivery vehicle and the customer.

Stations

As the density of urban land use increases, specialization becomes more effective and enables a narrower scope of city logistics. However, a distribution
centre servicing a low-density area often needs to
carry a large variety of goods in its inventory for a
longer period of time.

CHALLENGES OF URBAN
GOODS TRANSPORT
The diffusion of modern freight distribution systems
on the urban landscape generates environmental
and social externalities, ranging from vehicle emissions, accidents and congestion to logistics sprawl.
Addressing these externalities represents a set of

environmental, economic, social and institutional
challenges (Table 4.2).

Environmental challenges
Road transportation is the most polluting land transport mode per vehicle kilometre travelled, but
urban freight distribution offers limited alternatives
to roadways.22 Air pollution has decreased with the
gradual phasing out of leaded petrol and better
engine design.23 However, diesel trucks, the
dominant mode of urban deliveries, remain a major
source of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide
emissions.24 The share of urban freight depending
on the informal sector is hard to evaluate, as are
economic, environmental and social indicators for
these unreported activities.25 For the same number

Key challenges in urban
goods transport

of tonne-kilometres, urban freight distribution tends
to be more polluting, often twice as much as longdistance freight transport. The main reasons are as
follows:

Trucks account
for 22 per cent
of the global
greenhouse gas
emissions
generated by
transportation,
but due to
circulation
conditions in
urban areas this
share is higher

• Vehicle age. Urban delivery vehicles are older
than the average freight transport truck. It is
common that trucks end their lifecycle in drayage
operations26 between port or rail terminals and
urban distribution centres. The renewal of freight
fleets is generally slower than that for non-urban
road freight traffic, because urban freight involves
numerous competing small operators that cut
costs as much as possible. This problem is compounded in developing countries where vehicles
are even older, and thus more prone to higher
emissions and accidents.
• Vehicle size. Urban delivery vehicles tend to be
smaller than standard freight trucks, implying
that some economies of scale advantages are lost.
While smaller vehicles may be prone to fewer
emissions per kilometre travelled, at an aggregate
level, this may result in more emissions because
of a greater number of vehicles required to carry
the same amount of freight.
• Operating speeds and idling. Urban operating
speeds are slower due to congestion and traffic
restrictions, implying that the engines of delivery
vehicles are running at speeds consistently lower
than the optimal speed. This results in higher fuel
consumption and higher emission levels. Constant
acceleration and deceleration due to traffic lights
and traffic congestion result in an increase in fuel
consumption, as well as the wear on vehicles.
Vehicle idling is frequent either for deliveries or
at stops, which contributes to emissions.

Table 4.2

Greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution are
other environmental effects of urban freight transport. Trucks account for 22 per cent of the global
greenhouse gas emissions generated by transportation,27 but due to circulation conditions in urban areas
this share is higher. For instance, in large European
cities, freight transport is responsible for a third
of transport-related nitrogen oxides and half of

transport-related particulate matter emissions, mostly
due to a higher reliance on diesel fuels for trucks.
In London, freight distribution accounts for less than
10 per cent of urban traffic but contributes to 30
per cent of nitrogen oxide emissions and 63 per cent
of particulate emissions.28 In the metropolitan area
of Mexico City, about 60 per cent of particulate
matters generated by mobile sources were from
freight vehicles.29 While little is known about the
potential vulnerability of urban goods transport to
climate change, it is assumed that events such as
floods, storms and heat waves will be as disruptive
to urban goods transport as they are to urban activities
in general.30
Since urban areas are large consumers of final
goods, the issue of reverse logistics deserves
consideration, as it involves the collection of wastes
and recycling of materials.31 City logistics and environmentally sustainable logistics (green logistics) are thus
decisively linked. Most developed countries have
formal recycling programmes, while in developing
countries cities essentially leave a significant share
of the recycling of goods to the informal sector. The
recycling of used goods, packages and cardboard
takes specific forms; scavengers and recyclers are an
important feature of city life, with active informal
supply chains. The urban landscape of developing
countries also includes active street vending,
providing a wide range of retail and food goods.
Informal settlements are also an important component of the city landscape in many developing
countries, and have specific characteristics and supply
needs that are not well documented.

Economic challenges
The growth in the amount of freight circulating
within urban areas has further exacerbated traffic
congestion. Urban goods transport is usually subject
to smaller volumes but with frequent deliveries, as
inventory levels in urban stores tend to be low. Due
to the limited availability of storage space in central
areas, urban goods are delivered regularly from
distribution centres at the periphery. However,
despite peak-hour traffic congestion, a regular flow
of deliveries must be maintained. This incites freight
distribution activities to take place during the night
if possible. Furthermore, many stores in high-density
areas have limited capacity to accommodate deliveries, implying that delivery trucks must park along
the street in the vicinity of the store, preferably in
front. This induces the usage of smaller trucks better
able to circulate within urban areas and find parking
space for deliveries. It is not uncommon for trucks
to double-park for short deliveries, thus seriously
impeding local circulation.
Since real estate is at a premium in urban
areas, stores tend to have limited warehousing space
and are smaller in size. Urban freight distribution

Box 4.7 Cities and logistical performance
No international comparative analysis of the logistical
performance of cities has yet been undertaken, but
country-wide surveys have been compiled in recent years
by the World Bank. The logistics performance index
(LPI) is a composite index based on proxy measures for
transport and information infrastructure, supply chain
management and trade facilitation capabilities. These
indicator scores are calculated using a world survey of
international freight forwarders and express carriers. LPI
values range from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) and show that
building the capacity to connect firms, suppliers and
consumers, is key, in a context where predictability and
reliability are becoming as important as costs in supply
chain management. An LPI value of less than 3 reflects an
array of problems within a country’s freight distribution
system, causing undue delays and additional costs. For
instance, a difference of one point lower in the LPI is
related to two to four additional days of port hinterland
access, and a 25 per cent higher physical inspection rate
at customs. The performance metrics of the LPI do not
capture the environmental and social externalities of
logistics.

is subject to smaller volumes, with time-sensitive
freight necessary to replenish a constant demand.
This requires a high frequency of deliveries, particularly considering high sales volumes, which
imposes a contradiction in the cargo load. Stores in
central areas would benefit from the economies of
scale of larger deliveries, but the setting does not
permit this advantage. This is one of the reasons why
retailing has emerged in suburban areas. Large stores
with ample parking space can have their own cargo
docking bays that can accommodate the largest
delivery trucks available; the benefits of economies
of scale are multiplied with economies of distribution.
The tendency of large urban areas to have high
congestion levels poses a challenge towards the
reliability of freight distribution. This is particularly
the case for the disruptions and lower driving speeds
that urban congestion imposes, making urban freight
distribution prone to inefficiencies, compared to
circulation taking place in a suburban or non-urban
setting. Although there have been some attempts to
assess countries’ performance on trade logistics (see
for example Box 4.7), the logistical performance of
cities remains problematic and difficult to assess.
However, evidence shows that port and airport cities
tend to have more capabilities for city logistics
because of the availability of international trade infrastructures and a concentration of third-party logistics
service providers. A share of these capabilities is used
for urban freight distribution.
The diffusion of e-commerce has also created
new forms of demands and new forms of urban dis-

While the LPI reflects global trade and supply chains, it
can also be reflective of the logistical capabilities of cities.
For instance, a low LPI is reflective of inefficient customs
procedures, including governance that does not appropriately
regulate and mitigate urban freight distribution. Of the world’s
cities with more than 1 million inhabitants, 334 million
inhabitants lived in cities within countries with a low LPI (less
than 3), and 593 million lived in cities with below average LPI
conditions (between 3 and 3.5). Only 330 million people were
living in cities of more than 1 million inhabitants, with good LPI
conditions (more than 3.5). It can thus be inferred that more
than half of the world’s urban population are living in cities
where the logistical capabilities are deficient. This assessment
should be interpreted with caution, as significant national
differences exist, for example, between coastal China, which
has efficient export-oriented freight distribution systems, and
its interior provinces where the quality of transport infrastructures is more inadequate. Port and airport cities tend to have
more capabilities for city logistics, because of the availability of
international trade infrastructures and a concentration of third
party logistics service providers.

tribution with a growth in home deliveries.32 The
parcels industry has been booming, largely because
of e-commerce, and in some cases has been proactive
at establishing novel forms of last-mile deliveries.

Social and institutional challenges
From a social standpoint, the interactions between
people and freight in cities create many disturbances
related to health, safety (accidents) and the quality
of life (Table 4.3). Urban goods transport can have
substantial impacts on the communities they originate
from, are bound to or are transiting through. This
is particularly the case when large freight facilities
such as a port, airport, rail yard or distribution
centres are operating. Passenger and freight transport do not mingle well, particularly during commuting around peak hours where both systems
seriously impair their respective capacity and performance. In developing countries, traffic congestion
is a significant operational problem for city logistics,
with slow non-motorized vehicles sharing urban
roads with motorized traffic.
Freight-intensive activities such as terminals,
container storage areas, warehouses and truck depots
can be an aesthetic blight on the urban landscape,
and are associated with lower property values. As
many freight facilities operate on a 24-hour basis,
lights can be an annoyance and a source of potential sleep disruption. Furthermore, living or working
in proximity to roads or terminals with substantial
freight activities exposes residents, particularly

women and children, to harmful pollutants such as
particulate matters emitted by diesel engines. Other
disadvantages include associated healthcare costs,
productivity losses for workers and general impairments in the quality of life. Noise emissions by urban
freight distribution, including terminal operations, are
also a salient issue, as trucks are noisier than other
vehicles.
Safety is an important consideration for both
citizens and freight operators. Freight vehicles are
not necessarily more unsafe than other vehicles,
but because of blind spots, slower vehicle reaction
times, larger loads or loads of hazardous materials,
freight should always be considered in the planning
process. It may be particularly important to understand how freight vehicles interact with motorized
and non-motorized passenger transportation. Therefore, the risk of accidents by heavy freight vehicles
and the reconciliation of truck traffic with nonmotorized transport is an emerging policy concern.
This is mainly due to the safety issues that arise
when heavy freight vehicles encounter pedestrians
on local streets. Given that freight contributes to
traffic congestion, it has a negative impact on the
social cohesion of communities, resulting in lower
levels of social interaction.33
Workers in the freight distribution sector, from
drivers to warehouse workers, have a higher
occupational risk than most professions.34 A majority
of freight-related jobs offer low wages and limited
benefits to their employees, in a work environment
that is fast paced and prone to accidents and injuries.
Safety issues can also arise during the frequent
shipment and transportation of hazardous materials
taking place along urban corridors. Also, the prevalence of sexual risk behaviour among truck drivers
along urban corridors and in some cities has had
negative social impacts and exacerbated the spread
of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
in many developing-country cities. In Brazil, for

instance, high levels of sexual risk behaviour were
recorded among truck drivers in two port cities,
Santos and Itajai.35
From a regulatory standpoint, urban areas are
highly constrained with a variety of rules related to
zoning, emissions and even access conditions to
roads and terminals. High population densities imply
a low tolerance for infringements and disturbances
brought by freight distribution.36 Actors involved
in urban goods transport are thus prone to more
regulatory pressures than freight forwarders operating
outside major urban areas. This represents an
additional risk of having urban freight activities
deemed a nuisance, which could result in costly
mitigation strategies. For example, several major
airports within metropolitan areas have had their
night operations curtailed due to noise emissions over
nearby residential districts.
Furthermore, compensation and resettlement
mechanisms are often not adequate, particularly in
developing countries where the state and local
governments use the power of eminent domain to
create spaces for transportation infrastructures,
thus increasing the vulnerability of the poor in cases
of involuntary resettlement. Another issue gaining
prominence in urban goods transport is the need to
address environmental justice, since concentrations
of the poor and minority populations suffer disproportionately from negative social impacts from
transportation-related developments.37 This is far
from being a recent phenomenon, as the siting
of communities with lower economic status was
historically associated with proximity or adjacency to
terminals and industrial areas. Often, communities
are caught in a vicious circle of deriving limited
benefits from activities integrated in global and
national supply chains that generate strong externalities. In this context of growing conflicts between
freight and the city, port authorities tend to be more
proactive in mitigating the social impacts on adjacent

For instance, in 2010 the Port of Los Angeles (US),

where capital derived from port operations was set
aside to be invested in social and environmental
mitigation efforts.38

EXISTING POLICY
RESPONSES
Urbanization and its associated growth in material
consumption have reached a point where a more
concerted approach to freight distribution is advocated.39 This requires an understanding of the key
challenges in urban freight distribution and the
dissemination of practices and methods, notably data
collection, to enhance urban mobility and sustainability.40 As stated earlier, urban areas are constrained
and subject to a complex regulatory framework.
Thus, the urban space is prone to conflicts between
different stakeholders, but there are also opportunities for collaboration as space for urban logistics
must be recognized as a fundamental element of
urban planning.41 It can be complex for a distributor
to adapt homogeneous freight distribution practices
to a specific urban environment with its particular
regulations.
Furthermore, priorities diverge. In Europe and
Japan, an enduring concern relates to the circulation
of heavy vehicles in urban areas, as density and the
physical characteristics of streets challenge urban
freight distribution. In North America, due to lower
densities, the focus has been on load consolidation
as urban deliveries are commonly less than a truckload. In many developing countries, the lack of
resources often hinders adequate policy responses.
Still, an array of policies have been considered to

mitigate urban freight distribution problems, most
of which are related to traffic congestion (Table
4.4).42

Rationalization of deliveries
Night deliveries are emerging as a preferable strategy
for city logistics since they take place at a time when
there is less traffic congestion and fewer conflicts as
a result of commuting. However, night deliveries
impose important changes in the organization of
labour, for both the freight forwarder and the consignee. Distribution centres must be open at night,
even intermodal terminals, while the consignee must
have labour available to receive deliveries. For smaller
stores, night delivery could impose prohibitive additional labour costs. In such a setting, carriers tend
to prefer night deliveries, since their vehicles can
operate in a less-congested setting, with the possibility of using larger vehicles, while retailers would
prefer daytime deliveries that correspond to the
availability of their workforce. In high-density areas,
night deliveries can also result in local disturbances
such as noise at a time when families are at home.
Extended delivery windows provide additional
options, particularly outside peak hours. Like night
deliveries, they impose challenges in the organization
of labour with longer and irregular hours. Developing countries are better placed to see the implementation of this form of rationalization as labour
conditions are more ‘flexible’,43 but operational
margins for activities such as retail are tight.

Freight facilities
Freight facilities can be designed and adapted to suit
the requirements of city logistics. An important
aspect is to achieve a level of consolidation of loads,
many of which are less than a truckload, so that more

cargo can be placed per delivery vehicle. One such
facility is labelled the urban freight transhipment
centre, where deliveries bound to specific commercial
districts are grouped even if for different customers.
It is similar to cross-docking facilities used by retailers
to organize their regional distribution. These facilities
encourage a better usage of delivery assets, resulting
in less traffic congestion in central areas. This is linked
with higher costs, as an additional consolidation
stage takes place at the urban freight distribution
centre. This again involves additional delays and
undermines the potential profitability of such a
strategy. It is also likely that the common delivery
service does not necessarily meet the requirements
of the consignee in terms of delivery time and
frequency.
Local freight stations are an additional alternative
in high-density areas, by offering a local point of
consolidation or deconsolidation for pickups and
deliveries. Cargo is delivered by trucks to local freight
stations, with the final deliveries from the freight
station to the consignee commonly done on rolling
carts. The implementation of local freight stations
has received limited attention, particularly due to its
higher costs and lack of flexibility to accommodate
the needs of specific supply chains. Automated
locker banks are a type of local freight station that
is gaining momentum, since it fits well the needs of
e-commerce. In Germany, the Deutsche Post (DHL)
has installed thousands of ‘PackStations’ at strategic
locations, so that consignments can be delivered
at any time of the day. In the US, the giant online
retailer Amazon initiated a similar initiative with the
setting of delivery lockers in the central areas of large
cities, mostly in collaboration with pharmacies and
convenience stores that have long opening hours.
An important element of urban freight distribution in developing countries is the bus station,
which doubles as a nexus for regional passengers’ transportation and a common point of entry
for freight.44 These stations are particularly relevant
since vehicle ownership tends to be low, with the
population relying on intercity bus services. Small
freight forwarding companies and distribution
centres, often informal, are filling an important role
in city logistics. Appropriate design of bus stations
– i.e. with a section allocated to freight (e.g. delivery
areas and warehouses) – is a strategy that could help
mitigate city logistics problems in several developing countries, particularly since bus stations tend to
be centrally located.
Another strategy concerns the implementation
of designated delivery areas, ensuring that delivery
vehicles have better access to consignees, and that
deliveries take place in a less disruptive fashion (e.g.
avoiding double-parking). However, reserving parking
space for deliveries implies that less parking space
is available for passenger vehicles, which can lead to
conflicts with residents (even if freight parking spaces

are available during the night). Despite the availability
of delivery areas, the intensity of freight distribution
may create a parking demand beyond the capacity of
available delivery areas.

Modal adaptation
Urban delivery vehicles can be adapted to better
suit the density of urban distribution, which often
involves smaller vehicles such as vans, including
bicycles. The latter have the potential to become a
preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly in highdensity and congested areas. In locations where
bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery
bicycles are also used to carry personal cargo (e.g.
groceries).45 Due to their low acquisition and
maintenance costs, cargo bicycles convey much
potential in developed and developing countries
alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in
Indonesia.46 Services using electrically assisted
delivery tricycles have been successfully implemented
in France47 and are gradually being adopted across
Europe for services as varied as parcel and catering
deliveries. Using bicycles as cargo vehicles is
particularly encouraged when combined with policies
that restrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of
a city, such as downtown or commercial districts, or
with the extension of dedicated bike lanes.
Efforts can also be made to have less polluting
and more energy-efficient vehicles, including CNG
and electric vehicles, which can reduce energy
consumption and lower environmental impacts.
However, these vehicles tend to be more expensive,
which can be prohibitive in developing countries.
Furthermore, greener vehicles and alternative fuels
cannot mitigate the increasing traffic levels worldwide. Information technologies that are actively
used by parcel carriers, such as vehicle tracking, load
management and navigation, have the potential to
improve the usage of distribution assets such as
warehousing space and vehicles. The introduction of
such technologies can lead to new forms of urban
distribution, such as collaborative distribution (competing activities, such as stores, hotels and restaurants, using the same distribution services) with better
trip sequence matching (better order of pickups and
deliveries to minimize travelling distance). Since
information technologies are increasingly low cost
and ubiquitous (e.g. cellular data networks), such
applications are suitable in both developed and developing countries.
The existing public transport system could also
be used to move freight, but this implies numerous
challenges: in terms of the adaptation of modes, the
usage of existing passenger terminals and scheduling issues. One particular point of concern is that
the mandate of public transport authorities does not
involve freight. As a result, many agencies either have
little incentive or do not have the legal authority to

develop freight initiatives. Fares can also be an issue,
since public transport fare systems are per passenger with no equivalent for freight. From a logistics
perspective, the rationale behind using public transport is limited, as it involves load-break and potential
breaches in integrity. Many attempts at developing
‘cargo-trams’ (tramways adapted to carry cargo)
have failed, such as the ambitious cargo-tram project
in Amsterdam (the Netherlands) that went bankrupt in 2009.48 The expansion of passenger rail
services in suburban areas often raises conflicts, due
to the dominance that freight assumes in interurban
services. For instance, passenger rail services and
freight trains that share the same track segments
are likely to result in delays and schedule integrity
issues. Outside building new rail infrastructures,
the options are limited to stringent infrastructure
sharing agreements between passengers and freight
rail services.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
The city of the twenty-first century is a city of intense
flows of people, material and information. As such,
goods transport is a fundamental component of
the urban environment, an issue that until recently
was neglected in the planning process. The challenge
is to balance the need to ensure efficiency of goods
transport, while minimizing externalities such as
congestion, the emission of pollutants, noise and
accidents.

As new strategies and practices are implemented, and also because of a trend towards higher
energy prices, more efficient urban freight distribution systems will emerge as part of a transition
towards greener forms of city logistics. Such strategies are centred mostly around the rationalization
of deliveries; the development of freight facilities
better adapted to the urban environment; and a
modal adaptation (vehicles, including non-motorized
modes, better adapted to urban circulation). While
these strategies are likely to reflect the unique modal
and infrastructural lattice of each city, it remains
uncertain if advances in city logistics will be sufficient
to cope with growing levels of congestion and the
related socioeconomic externalities, particularly in
developing countries. Accordingly, unique forms of
city logistics are emerging in developing countries,
due to significant differences in levels of income and
density. However, these cases are far less documented.
Goods transport remains a fundamental element of urban sustainability. Thus, it is essential that
the role and impact of goods transport in the urban
context is taken into consideration, if planning
accessible mobility for passengers is to be effective.
This is especially so when considering the close
interactions between urban land use, form and
goods transport within an increasingly contested
landscape.

CHAPTER

5

MOBILITY AND URBAN
FORM
Heightened concerns over climate change, rising
gasoline prices, traffic congestion and social exclusion
have sparked renewed interest to explore the link
between mobility and urban form.1 Worldwide, city
officials share relatively similar concerns about travel
time, air quality, road accidents, social integration,
better accessibility and improved use of different
modal transport solutions.
Despite this, most cities, particularly in developing countries and emerging economies, continue
to prioritize motorized transport and related urban
infrastructure. A large number of cities both in the
developing and developed countries are experiencing
fast and uncontrolled growth in their peripheries.
Consequently, there is a wide variety of urban forms,
defined by land-use and transportation systems that
are not conducive to the provision of ‘efficient’ forms
of urban mobility. There can be little doubt that
designing neighbourhoods, cities and regions in a way
that can reduce private car dependency, promote
healthier, more sustainable urban forms and a variety
of travel solutions, can make the city more accessible
to all. The pressure to develop sustainable transportation and mobility systems is particularly acute
in urban areas.
In recent years, city planners, developers and
policy-makers have increasingly looked towards
designing more compact cities with a mixture of land
uses in order to achieve a more sustainable urban
form. The ‘compact city’ policy, although difficult to
implement, can help shorten travel distances, thus
lower emissions and fuel consumption, reduce travel
costs and improve quality of life in many cities.
However, there is need for better solutions on how
to move from current unsustainable trends in urban
form and transportation towards a more sustainable
future.
There is increasing evidence that the form and
functionality of the city is crucial for the promotion
of sustainable mobility. Indeed, transforming cities
wherein a mix of activities is closer together, in a
more compact configuration, and interlaced by

high-quality pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, is
tantamount to the creation of a more accessible city.
As stressed in Chapter 1, accessibility lies at the core
of achieving an urban form that is environmentally
sustainable, socially equitable and inclusive, with
higher potential to generate economic interactions
that lead to productivity and income gains. Sustainable mobility is an outcome of how cities and neighbourhoods are designed and take form, but it also
shapes the urban form itself. This reflects the powerful, bi-directional relationship between mobility
and urban form that underscores the importance of
carefully coordinating and integrating the two. A reinvigorated notion of urban planning, solid institutions and governing structures is therefore required,
which can lead a process for this transformative
change.
A number of pressing mobility and environmental issues, which policy-makers at all levels
of government are wrestling with today, hinge on
changes in the design and form of cities for a more
efficient and sustainable solution. With the transport
sector accounting for nearly a quarter of greenhouse
gas emissions in metropolitan areas worldwide,
campaigns to stabilize the global climate include the
creation of less car-dependent urban forms.2 Stopping sprawl,3 promoting public-transport-oriented
growth and creating compact, walkable neighbourhoods that reduce vehicle-kilometres travelled (VKT)
per person are the cornerstones of such campaigns.
The EU’s Climate Change Programme calls for the
promotion of ‘low-emission land-use activities’ as a
way to moderate VKT growth, making an interesting
connection between urban form and transport.4
It is important to track VKT per capita, as it is the
strongest single correlate of environmental degradation and resource consumption in the urban transport sector. It has been projected that, in the absence
of substantial reductions in VKT per capita worldwide,
all increases in fuel-efficient and low-carbon fuels
will only slow, not reverse, the rise in per capita CO2
emissions.5

Spread-out, car-oriented development patterns, commonly referred to as ‘sprawl’, burden municipal
budgets, imposing high costs for extending infrastructure and public services to suburbs and exurbs. The
‘hard cost’ of providing local roads and utilities for
low-density growth is upwards of US$30,000 more
per household in the US compared to more compact,
mixed-use growth.6 If one-third of the future urban
growth of the US were directed toward central cities
and inner-suburbs, an estimated US$10,000 per
household (in year 2000 US$) could be saved.7 A
recent study estimated that converting peripheral
housing projects to infill planned residential developments in the consolidated parts of Malaysian cities
could reduce the financial costs for municipal services
by 19 per cent.8
Growing concerns over social equity have also
prompted interest in the design of cities. Physical
separation from jobs, schools and health clinics
imposes economic burdens on the poor, many of
whom reside on the urban periphery. Overcoming
this physical separation often means devoting disproportionate shares of income to public transport
fares and enduring long journeys. Besides shortening
journeys and making social amenities more accessible,
the connection between adequate transport solutions
and the provision of public goods can promote more
social interactions and when done properly, gives rise

to urban form that is conducive to community
building and ‘place making’.
This chapter describes current global trends
and conditions that have influenced urban form and
as a result, mobility (or the lack thereof). Forces
propelling the spread-out growth of cities and the
impacts of these trends on urban mobility are
discussed. The capacity of higher urban densities to
encourage alternative means of travel, particularly
public transport usage, is reviewed. Other elements
of built environments, such as the diversity of land
uses and urban designs, like integrated bikeway
networks, and their implications for travel, are also
examined. Creating compact, mixed-use and highly
walkable neighbourhoods and cities can create more
accessible urban landscapes, and in so doing
moderate levels of motorized travel and the ill-effects
associated with it. More accessible cities are also
more socially equitable and inclusive. The other
direction of the relationship – how urban transport
infrastructure, such as motorways and metro-rail
systems, shapes urban form – also receives attention.
The chapter closes with discussions on the potential
of various policy strategies, such as transit-oriented
development (TOD) and regional jobs–housing
balance, to strengthen mobility–urban form linkages
and promote sustainable transport modes.

Box 5.1 Suburbanization in Eastern Europe
The transitional economies of Eastern Europe have witnessed
rapid suburbanization. During the era of centralized planning,
most cities in Eastern Europe were products of integrated
transportation and land development, characterized by
extensive urban rail networks with residential towers,
shopping districts and industrial zones physically oriented to
stations. The change to free-market economies and
privatization of land development quickly unravelled this. In
some Eastern European countries, the rate of suburbanization
has surpassed that of cities in Western Europe. The latest
studies of land-cover changes have ranked cities in Estonia,
Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, as
among the most sprawling urban areas in Europe. By one
account:
‘“communist” urban forms were by many measures more
environmentally friendly and, thus, more sustainable than
capitalist urban forms. They were more compact and had
smaller ecological footprints; they were high-density and
had a clear urban edge rather than sprawling and monofunctional suburban-type peripheries; they had better
integrated land uses and were less socially polarized; they
had abundant parks and greenbelts; and, they had reliable

public transit systems. Ironically, all these aspects of the
communist city are hallmarks of urban sustainability. Most
of them were lost during the post communist transition.’a
Privatization of land development, such as the construction of
mega-malls and housing estates on the periphery, coincided
with the abandonment and often discontinuation of former
state-owned urban rail services, which along with the rapid
growth in private car ownership resulted in motorways being
built in their place. Some observers have criticized
international aid agencies – such as the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the European
Investment Bank – for fanning the flames of sprawl in Eastern
Europe by favouring investments in suburban motorways over
revamping and upgrading aging inner-city rail lines. Hypersuburbanization has spawned dramatic shifts in travel, such as
in Prague, Czech Republic, where former trips by foot or
public transport to central-city shops are rapidly being
replaced by long-distance car trips to freeway-served malls and
large-scale retail outlets, dramatically increasing VKT.

Box 5.2 Dispersed growth in India
In recent years, Indian cities have witnessed an accelerated
transformation of agricultural lands on their peripheries to
new townships, residential subdivisions and commercial
centres. This has lead to marked increases in traffic
congestion, air pollution, demand for roads and parking,
accidents and energy consumption. Around Mumbai, seven
new towns have emerged within 50 kilometres of the old
city. Around Delhi as well, new urban centres have cropped
up within 20 to 50 kilometres radius of the city centre.

DECENTRALIZATION, CAR
DEPENDENCE AND TRAVEL
This section reviews the influences of decentralized
urban growth on mobility and travel worldwide, the
role played by transport in the decentralization
process, as well as the impact of urban densities and
urban land coverage on travel.

The dispersal metropolis
The dispersal of growth from the urban centre is a
worldwide phenomenon. Dispersal, as a form of
decentralization, at least when it is poorly planned,
lies at the heart of unfolding patterns of urban development that are environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable. With dispersal come: lower
densities, separation of land uses and urban activities,
urban fragmentation, segregation by income and
social class, consumption of precious resources such
as farmland and open space and more car-dependent
systems. While megatrends like rising affluence and
modernization have fuelled the dispersal of cities
worldwide, social-cultural factors have played a
role as well. In Latin America, land held by government agencies, military authorities and religious
foundations often triggers leapfrog (i.e. skippedover) development.9 Social exclusion, class segregation and poverty itself can also stretch the boundaries
of cities; tugurios and favelas (i.e. slums) mark the
peripheries of most Latin American cities. In Chinese
cities, peri-urban development is partly driven by
financial motives, e.g. municipalities buy land at low
agricultural prices and lease the land to developers
at higher prices as a way to raise revenues. Like in
China, the transition to free-market economies has
accelerated suburban growth throughout Eastern
Europe (Box 5.1). In India, zoning policies that suppress permissible densities as a means of decongesting central cities have been blamed for inducing
sprawl in recent decades (Box 5.2). Easy-to-obtain
credit for low-income housing has triggered an
explosive growth in low-cost but isolated residential
enclaves on the outskirts of many Mexican cities,

Most public policies in India encourage sprawl. In an explicit
attempt to decongest city centres, government regulations
limit floor to land area ratios for buildings in the centre, and
thus restrict building heights and development densities. By
contrast, government regulations allow higher floor space
indexes in suburban areas, effectively pushing new growth
from the core to the periphery.

which over time has led to abandonments; between
2006 and 2009, some 26 per cent of such housing
that was built was unoccupied.10 Nearly a third of
individuals who abandoned their homes did so
because of poor access to jobs, schools and family.
Urban dispersal has an unmistakable and
profound influence on travel. Spread-out growth not
only lengthens journeys by separating trip origins and
destinations, but also increases the use of private
motorized vehicles. In developed countries, suburban
living, associated with the lowering of population and
employment densities, has contributed to rising
motorization rates and the environmental problems
related to car dependency. When urban dispersal is
driven almost exclusively by market forces and is
largely unplanned, car dependency, energy consumption, environmental degradation and social problems
in urban areas are further exacerbated (Box 5.3).
Over-regulation of urban development (e.g. zoning
codes that require significant supplies of off-street
parking) can also induce car-dependent sprawl by
suppressing market preferences. Increasingly, trends
both in developed and various developing countries
suggest that many young adults want to live in
compact, walkable neighbourhoods.11
Urban sprawl is increasingly prevalent in developing countries. From 1970 to 2000, the physical
expansion of all urban areas in Mexico was nearly
four times more than their urban population
growth.12 In Cairo (Egypt), Sana’a (Yemen), Panama

Box 5.3 Urban sprawl
The term ‘urban sprawl’ describes low-density, dispersed, single-use, car-dependent
built environments and settlement patterns that, critics charge, waste energy, land and
other resources and divide people by race, ethnicity and income/wealth. A cardinal
feature of sprawl is the physical separation of co-dependent land uses – e.g. housing is
isolated from jobs, schools, hospitals, retail activities, etc. – leading to increasingly
lengthy (and thus resource-consuming) journeys. Sprawl is synonymous with poorly
planned, piecemeal and haphazard patterns of urban growth, requiring larger shares of
trips to be made by motorized modes over increasingly longer distances.

City (Panama) and Caracas (Venezuela), sprawl is
blamed for consuming scarce agricultural lands
and dramatically increasing municipal costs for infrastructure and service delivery.13 In urban Sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America and South Asia, sprawl has been
associated with class segregation. Often, higherincome households occupy the most accessible and
expensive districts near the urban core, forcing many
low-skilled, low-income immigrants from rural areas
and displaced low-income inner-city residents to
outlying, marginal areas, where land is cheaper. Class
and income disparities are deeply embedded in the
spatial arrangements and mobility challenges of many
developing-country cities.14

Global urban density patterns and trends
Figure 5.1 shows that Asian and African cities are,
on average, around 35 per cent denser than cities in
Latin America, 2.5 times denser than European cities,
and nearly 10 times denser than cities in North
America and Oceania (mostly from the US, Australia
and New Zealand). Overall, 39 of the world’s 100
densest urban areas were situated in Asia in 2010.15
Cities of developing countries have been sprawling
more rapidly than those in developed countries.
From 1990 to 2000, average urban densities fell from
3545 to 2835 people per square kilometre in
developed countries compared to a drop from 9860
to 8050 people per square kilometre in developing
ones.16
A two-century perspective reveals dramatic
longitudinal declines in urban densities, especially
in developing countries. Figure 5.2 traces the downward trend in built-up area densities for 25 cities
from as early as the late 1700s to 2000. Densities
declined fourfold from their peak, from an average
of 43,000 persons per square kilometre to an average

of 10,000 persons per square kilometre around the
year 2000, at an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent.17
At this rate, urban densities can be expected to
decline another 26 per cent by 2040. According to
one projection, a continuation of the trends in sprawl
translates into a tripling of land area for each new
resident by 2030, converting on average some 160
square metres of non-urban to urban land.18 If past
trends hold, this invariably translates into more cardependent, and thus inherently less sustainable,
cities of the future.

Urban transport as a factor increasing
urban sprawl
As many cities worldwide continue to experience
sprawl, built-up densities become lower. Transport
has played an important role in the sprawl of cities.19
Indeed, the advent of low-cost urban transport modes
– omnibuses, horse cars, trolleys, commuter trains
and later buses and cars – has accelerated the outward physical expansion of cities, making density
declines possible.20 In the pre-automobile era, movements within cities tended to be restricted to walking,
and urban forms compact, in order to reduce the need
for physical travel. The location of homes, shops,
restaurants and even factories kept urban distances
short and walkable. However, extreme overcrowding, lack of privacy and the overpowering stench of
manure from horse-drawn carriages forced many
who had the means to escape. Streetcar cities, which
emerged and expanded with the development of electrical power in most western cities, were heralded
as a triumph over the walking and horse-car city. This
is because they allowed the middle class to move to
lower density suburbs and escape the suffocating
urban densities of the early 1900s. Soon afterwards,
rail-served suburbs blossomed. Streetcars defined the

radial spines of most regions, extending urban boundaries five-fold or more beyond those of the walking
city.21 The internal combustion engine car technology
developed rapidly during the twentieth century,
and with it came the advent of the automobile city.
The automobile city allowed development to fill in
the wedges between radial corridors of the streetcar
city and metropolitan boundaries to extend outward
four to five times.22 The automobile city, and notably
the provision of grade-separated, limited-access freeways, further accelerated the dispersal of economic
activities, unleashing low-density, discontinuous
patterns of urban growth associated with sprawl.23
Alongside the freeways (among other factors), a
more polycentric urban form was developed, marked
by shopping malls, office parks, airports and other
major activity centres, congregated near major access
points.24
Seventy years ago, a noted urban sociologist
observed that urban form is largely a product of the
dominant transportation system that was in place
during a city’s prevailing period of growth.25 European
cities such as London (UK), Madrid (Spain) and
Prague (Czech Republic) that grew, in relative terms,
most rapidly in the 1800s, retain many features of
walking and streetcar cities in their urban core. US
cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Houston,
whose explosive periods of growth coincided with
the construction of freeways, by contrast, are sprawling and car dependent. This increasingly characterizes the outskirts of Jakarta (Indonesia), Lagos
(Nigeria), São Paulo (Brazil) and many other cities in
developing countries that are presently experiencing
rapid motorization and population growth. Further,
the urgency of advancing sustainable mobility and
urban-form practices in rapidly expanding towns
and cities of developing countries, such as India and
China, is underscored.

Urban density and travel
Urban densities strongly influence travel. The impact
of densities on travel – and therefore, energy consumption and natural environments – gained
particular attention in the 1990s, in the wake of a
global energy crisis and economic recession. A 1989
cross-sectional comparison of 32 cities showed
transport-related energy consumption declines precipitously with urban densities (Figure 5.3).26 US
cities averaged the lowest densities and nearly twice
the petrol consumption per capita as Australian
cities, around four times as much as more compact
European cities, and ten times that of three compact
Asian cities – Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo.
These results were attributed to far higher usage and
kilometres travelled by private cars in sprawling
cities than in compact, public-transport-oriented
ones. Follow-up studies of 37 cities in 1999 found
similar results: low-density cities averaged considerably higher VKT per capita than high-density ones.27
Even within countries, this relationship remains
strong. Panel studies of density and travel in the US
and the UK have associated the doubling of urban
densities with 15 per cent and 25 per cent declines
in VKT per capita.28 However, what accompanies
density – e.g. lower car ownership rates, less road
space per capita, fewer and more expensive parking
and better quality public transport services – can also
be important factors associated with density.29 In
most instances, density is a necessary, though not a
sufficient, condition for moderating private car use
and fuel consumption.
City-level studies such as shown in Figure 5.3
have also been criticized for being too aggregate,
thus masking variations within cities, and differences among subpopulations. However, even within
the same metropolitan area, substantial differences
in VKT per capita have been recorded. A study of

and San Francisco – found, after controlling household size, income effects and using odometer readings, that car ownership and use declined in a
systematic and predictable pattern as a function of
increasing residential density.30 Similarly, evidence
suggests a negative association between urban
densities and vehicular travel in other big cities that
are rapidly motorizing including Santiago (Chile),
Beijing (China), Lisbon (Portugal) and Moscow
(Russia).31 Once average density levels are reached,
the rate of drop-off tapers, offering a useful policy
guide to the association between mobility and
urban form. For example, Hong Kong style high-rise
densities are not needed for major declines in
energy consumption and motorized movements to
be achieved. Rather, going from very low-density
sprawl (e.g. the suburbs of car-oriented Houston) to
modest densities of town homes and duplexes,
produces the biggest declines in transport-sector
energy consumption and VKT.
The risk of potential self-selection bias is also
worth noting. Might less car travel be due to density
or the fact that those who walk or bike more in
compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods choose such

places because of lifestyle and personal preferences?
One way to control for such possible effects is to
study changes in travel among individuals who moved
from one neighbourhood type to another. A study
from Seattle, US, found that those moving to neighbourhoods with higher accessibility (e.g. dense,
mixed-use settings closer to other destinations)
logged far fewer kilometres in vehicles.32 Furthermore, a recent review of 38 studies that statistically
controlled for self-selection effects revealed that
virtually all studies found that built environments,
including density metrics, still had statistically
significant influences on travel.33

Other attributes of urban form
influencing travel
Density is but one element of urban form that influences travel. The spatial distribution of population
and employment densities are also important.34
Where people live, work, shop and socialize, sets the
stage for travel by defining the location of trip origins
and destination, and thus the length of trips and the
energy they consume.

Urban land area (square kilometers)

Density gradients – i.e. the rate at which densities taper with distance from the core – are another
way to represent urban form. Figure 5.4 shows that
densities fell sharply from the centres of Asian and
European cities. This is characteristic of a monocentric or strong-centred metropolis. In contrast, the
density gradients of US cities are more flat, revealing
a more sprawling, car-oriented urban form (even for
greater New York City). Higher densities in the core
than the outskirts reflect higher market demand,
and higher real estate prices for more central and
accessible locations. The regulation of permissible

densities through zoning restrictions along with
factors such as rising affluence and the construction
of high-capacity freeways, have flattened the density
gradients of US cities and increasing numbers of
European cities. It has also resulted in the lengthening
of journeys and induced private car travel in the
process.35
Urban land cover (i.e. the total built-up area of
a city) and compactness (i.e. the degree to which a
city’s footprint approximates a circle rather than
a tentacle-like shape) are additional ways to characterize urban form.36 Figure 5.5 shows that, on

average, North American cities take up more than
twice as much land as Latin American cities, which
consume slightly more land than European, Asian and
African cities.
Tracing city footprints of Bandung (Indonesia)
and Accra (Ghana) reveals the types of land consumed
by new development in two fast-growing developingcountry cities. Between 1991 and 2011, Bandung’s
urban footprint roughly doubled, from 108 to 217
square kilometres.37 Of the newly built-up area, 60
per cent consisted of urban expansion into farmland
and open space, 17 per cent was leapfrog or noncontiguous development, and the rest was urban infill
(i.e. redevelopment of existing built-up areas).
Leapfrog development can be costly to serve since
basic infrastructure, such as sewerage and pipedwater, must be extended to far-flung, outlying settings. Overall, Bandung’s urban densities declined 1.4
per cent annually over this ten-year period. From 1985
to 2000, Accra’s land area grew 153 per cent, which
is twice as fast as its population growth. Accra’s urban
growth consisted largely of the extension of city
boundaries into former agricultural areas.

Urban form and travel

Polycentric
regions can mount
successful public
transport services
by using subcentres to
interlink highquality and
synchronized rail
services

Just as density influences the distances and modes
of travel, other attributes of urban form – including
the spatial distribution of population and employment
and land coverage – shape the spatial patterns of trips.
A monocentric urban form, wherein the vast majority
of jobs and commercial activities are concentrated
in the city centre and most households reside on the
periphery, mostly produces radial trips (Figure 5.6).
Whereas the convergence of vehicles near the centre
often gives rise to extreme road congestion, it also
allows for heavily patronized radial public transport
networks to thrive. A multi-centred, or polycentric,
form results in more dispersed, lateral and cross-town
travel patterns, which generally favour flexible forms
of mobility, such as private cars.38 Polycentric regions
can mount successful public transport services by

using sub-centres to interlink high-quality and
synchronized rail services, such as those in Singapore
and Paris. Suburban centres and nodes effectively
become the interchange points for connecting largescale public transport networks. The degree to which
station nodes average higher densities depends on
the larger shares of trips by non-motorized modes
such as walking and cycling.
Like densities, urban land coverage influences
travel. From 1980 to 2005, average kilometres driven
per person in the US increased by 50 per cent, a
change partly explained by the nearly 20 per cent
increase in land consumed per person over the same
period.39 In India, trip lengths are more influenced
by land area (Figure 5.7) than by urban densities
(Figure 5.8). Among India’s 21 largest cities, the
relationship between population density and average
trip length is slightly positive. The slope of the plot
of urbanized land area and trip length, however, is
noticeably steeper. This reflects the sprawl-inducing
effect of floor space index (FSI) restrictions in the
urban cores of most Indian cities, used to decongest
the centre. Redirecting growth to the periphery
might lessen central-city traffic congestion at the
expense of longer distance trips, which are more
dependent on motorized transport (including twoand three-wheelers).
The larger the city, the greater its complexity
and the potential to influence future traffic conditions, particularly if not well managed. Larger cities
have significantly higher average urban densities
than smaller cities and thus higher traffic densities
(e.g. vehicles travelling roads per square kilometre).
Between 1990 and 2000, a doubling of population
among 120 cities worldwide was associated with a
16 per cent increase in density.40 As city size and
spatial coverage increase, so do the average lengths
of trips, the severity of traffic congestion and environmental pollution. Traffic congestion is part of the
territory of megacities, regardless of the quality of
metro services.41 The rate of congestion growth is
also increasing rapidly in medium-sized cities that

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 5.4 Mobility and over-concentrated development in Beijing, China
Beijing’s 2005 master plan called for the creation of 11 new
towns in peripheral regions of the city. The primary aim of
shifting growth to the outskirts has been to mitigate overcrowding in the city’s central built-up area. The city has built a
total of seven ring roads in an attempt to connect the new
towns and divert traffic from the city’s core. While new town
development embraced the idea of China’s capital city
becoming a polycentric one, Beijing’s urban form is
characterized as high-density monocentric, rather than multicentred. The city has witnessed a seemingly continuous
outward expansion from the central built-up area, with
densities tapering only slightly from the core. That is, the
region has become a high- to moderate-density development,
from the traditional core to the outskirts, with few dominant
centres.

suffer from deficient street layouts, poor connectivity
and inadequate public transport. These conditions are
further exacerbated when traffic demand approaches
or exceeds the available capacity of the transport
system during peak hours. The expansion of cities
and high densities inevitably creates challenges in
the urban environment, particularly in developing
countries. For example, the large concentration of
employment and economic activities, coupled with
inadequate public transport in megacities such as
Manila (the Philippines), Lagos (Nigeria), Jakarta
(Indonesia) and Mexico City, have resulted in
exceedingly high traffic densities, and comparatively
long trips by motorized transport.42
While urban agglomeration allows for job
specialization, efficient market transactions and
knowledge spillovers, if concentrated growth is not
well planned – such as the integration of urban
growth with metro investments – the resulting
economic benefits tend to erode. Agglomeration diseconomies – i.e. the inefficiency and loss resulting
from poorly planned concentrations – is expressed
in the form of lost labour productivity from extreme
traffic congestion, increasing air pollution and an
overall decline in the quality of urban living. The overconcentration of activities in the city’s urban core
has been blamed for Beijing’s increasing traffic
congestion and environmental problems (Box 5.4).
Evidence from recent studies conducted in UK cities
revealed that decongesting the core by dispersing
growth to sub-centres can raise economic productivity without increasing transportation energy
use, greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution
levels.43

The high and continuous concentration of urban
activities over a large geographic territory has led to extreme
traffic congestion and air pollution. The fact that the city has
failed to create relatively self-functioning suburban clusters has
undermined its ability to develop cost-effective high-capacity
public transport services, leading to high levels of car usage
and VKT per capita. Beijing’s failure to implement a multicentred urban form stems from the tendency for ring roads to
spread development evenly in all directions, from the
traditional core. Expanded rail investments and a policy
commitment to TOD – i.e. concentrating more growth
around metro stations – could give rise to a more clustered
pattern of suburban development in the future, with increased
mobility and environmental benefits.

URBAN DENSITIES AND
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
THRESHOLDS
No aspect of urban form and travel has been more
closely studied than the influences of urban densities
on public transport ridership. It is widely accepted
that high densities are essential for sustaining costeffective public transport services. Mass transit, it is
said, needs ‘mass’, or density. As observed almost a
half-century ago, ‘nothing is so conducive to the
relative economy of rail transit as high volumes and
population density. High population density increases
the costs of all urban transportation systems, but
substantially less for rail than for other modes’.44 Rail,
with its high up-front capital costs and economies of
scale, needs to attain a threshold density of trips, in
order to cost less than accommodating the same trips
by car or bus. Since rail-based public transport needs
high passenger volumes to be cost-effective, it also
needs high concentrations of people and jobs around
stations.
Figure 5.9 indicates a relationship between
public transport ridership and urban form. Very lowdensity cities with a predominantly polycentric form
are unabashedly autocentric. In spread-out cities
such as Atlanta (US), public transport has a difficult
time competing with the private car. Public transport
that is cost-effective can only be achieved through
high urban densities and a large share of jobs and
retail activities concentrated in the urban core (such
as in Shanghai, China), or in polycentric cities with
multi-directional travel patterns (such as Stockholm,
Sweden). Many large cities, such as Jakarta (Indonesia) and Paris (France), lie somewhere between the
aforementioned extremes: both private mobility and
public transport can compete for trips when densities

Figure 5.10 shows that there is a positive
correlation between urban population density and
public transport ridership per capita. Hong Kong,
with extremely high densities, is a statistical outlier
– averaging comparatively low transit trips per capita
relative to its high densities. This maybe attributed
to the fact that many trip destinations are close to
each other, thereby resulting in an extraordinarily
high share of trips made by foot. Removing the Hong
Kong case from the database produces an even
stronger statistical fit.
The reliance of public transport on urban
densities has prompted efforts to define the minimum
density thresholds required to support successful
public transport services. On one hand, cities need
to average 3000 inhabitants per square kilometre to
support reasonably cost-effective public transport
services.45 On the other hand, for wealthier, more
car-oriented countries such as the US, UK, Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, a minimum threshold of
3500 people and jobs per square kilometre is
necessary if public transport is to generate sufficient
ridership to cover costs.46 Evidence suggests that new
suburbs in these countries rarely achieve more than
half of this minimum threshold.47 A similar study in
Athens (Greece) found that public transport trips per

Very high density

capita sharply increased to 20,000 persons per square
kilometre and then tapered, suggesting this figure as
a planning norm for successful public transport
services.48 While density thresholds have long been
set to guide public transport investments and TOD
planning in the US, these benchmarks are based on
limited data points and experiences (Box 5.5).
A recent US study examined the job and
population densities that are associated with costeffective public transport investments, based on the
country’s experiences with recent light-rail and
BRT investments.49 Figure 5.11, which is based on
this study, shows that a BRT system that costs US$30
million per kilometre would need around 4000 jobs
and residents per square kilometre within 800 metres
of its station to be in the top 75 per cent of costeffective investments. A light-rail investment at the
same per-kilometre cost requires 11,000 jobs and
residents per square kilometre; and a heavy-rail
investment requires nearly 14,000 per square
kilometre to fall in the top quartile.
However, as there are many city features that
influence public transport ridership, some observers
have cautioned against a fixation on density.50 The
walkability and land-use mixes of neighbourhoods
that surround stations are also important to viable
public transport services. If people cannot safely and
conveniently walk the half kilometre to or from a

Box 5.5 Density thresholds for cost-effective public transport in the US
The development of minimum density thresholds for
successful public transport investments in the US has been the
focus of numerous studies undertaken and policy initiatives
introduced to the world’s most car-dependent country.
Between the 1960s and 1970s, it was estimated, that the high
costs of heavy-rail investment required a minimum net
residential density of at least 3000 households per square kilometre. A minimal light-rail investment, by comparison, would
require at least 2400 households per square kilometre.
A more recent study of 59 capital investments in public transport in the US since 1970, found light rail to be more costeffective than heavy rail, resulting in approximately 7000
people and jobs per gross square kilometre. Across these
59 US projects, a 10 per cent increase in total population and

jobs per square kilometre corresponded with a 3.2 per cent
decrease in annualized capital costs per rider.
While capital investment costs also rise with density,
US experiences show the increased ridership more than
offsets these costs per passenger kilometre. As a result, the
justification for fixed-guideway public transport investments
has led to the adoption of density thresholds in US cities. The
city of San Diego, for instance, has adopted TOD guidelines
that call for a minimum of 6300 dwelling units per square
kilometre for light rail services serving urban transit-oriented
districts. In its TOD guidelines, metro Portland has set slightly
higher thresholds – 7500 dwelling units per square kilometre
for development within one city block of light rail stations.

Box 5.6 Dysfunctional densities of Los Angeles, US
The city of Los Angeles averages the highest overall population
density in the US matched by a thicket of criss-crossing
freeways and major arteries, which form a dense road
network. The city also averages the highest level of vehicular
travel per capita, and the worst traffic congestion in the US.
This dysfunctional combination of high population and road
densities has been called the ‘worst of all worlds’ – because
traffic congestion increases exponentially with car density and
city size; so do the externalities associated with car travel.
The suburbs of Los Angeles are dotted with three to four

station, chances are they will not use public transport. Conversely, if they can easily run errands and
coordinate trips on the way to or from a station, they
are more likely to take public transport. Further, the
presence of a convenience retail store along the walkaccess corridor to a public transport stop increases
the odds of public transport riding.51 The manner in
which densities are designed also matter. Lineal and
well-articulated densities aligned along busways,
such as the case of Curitiba (Brazil), are far more
conducive to public transport travel than the uniformly spread-out, poorly planned densities in Los
Angeles, US (Box 5.6). Where there is a mismatch
between the geometry of transportation systems

story walk-up garden-style apartments, horizontally stretched
within superblocks, creating long walking distances. Whereas
densities are high by US standards, they are not public
transport-oriented by European standards. In Los Angeles,
densities are generally too high for a car-dependent city and
are not organized along linear corridors in public transportfriendly manner. Such population densities are too high for
cars and too poorly organized for successful public transport –
they are, in effect, dysfunctional densities.

Box 5.7 ‘Compact cities’ or ‘smart growth’
‘Compact cities’ or ‘smart growth’ are terms that have gained
currency in the field of urban planning for describing urban
development that is compact, resource-efficient and less
dependent on the use of private cars. The term of ‘smart
growth’ is most commonly used in North America, while in
Europe and Australia the term ‘compact city’ is often used to
connote similar concepts. As an antidote to sprawl, these
terms aim to reduce the municipal fiscal burden of
accommodating new growth, while at the same time
promoting walking and cycling, historical preservation, mixedincome housing that helps reduce social and class segregation
and diversity of housing and mobility choices that appeal to a
range of lifestyle preferences. Ten accepted principles that
define such developments have:

signature feature of ‘compact cities’ or ‘smart growth’
(Box 5.7).53 Successful integration means making the
connections between transport and urban development work in both directions. As noted, the design
and layout of a city strongly influence travel demand.
At the same time, transportation infrastructure is an
essential feature that shapes the city. The coordination and integration of transport planning and development, as well as spatial planning and development
are key.
The coordinated planning of urban mobility and
land development starts with a collective vision of
the future city, shared by city government and major
stakeholders of civil society. Thereafter, a strategic
plan that orchestrates urban development is developed to realize the shared vision, and must include,
among other things, building the institutional,
regulatory and fiscal capacities to implement the plan.
A strategy plan aims to translate urban development
goals into long-range implementation in terms of
where and in what form development and redevelopment occurs, and the tools (e.g. laws and regulations, fiscal instruments, organizational reforms)
necessary to achieve desired outcomes.54 Visioning the future city as a precursor to transportation
decision-making reflects the derived nature of travel.
People travel to reach places, and it is these places
that serve the purposes of trips and the aspirations
of people who make them. Well-planned cities, such
as Singapore, Stockholm (Sweden) and Curitiba
(Brazil), crafted cogent visions of the future to shape
transportation investments and achieve the best
outcomes, whether measured in economic prosperity,
energy resourcefulness, cleanliness of the natural
environment or quality of life.55
The city of Copenhagen (Denmark) and its
celebrated ‘Finger Plan’ is a text-book example of a
long-term planning vision, which shaped rail invest-

ments and urban growth. A five-finger hand became
the metaphor for defining where growth would
and would not occur. Each finger was oriented to
a traditional Danish market town within the orbit
of metropolitan Copenhagen. The construction of
rail-based public transport was purposed to steer
growth along the desired growth axes, in advance of
travel demand. Also, greenbelt wedges set aside
as agricultural preserves, open space and natural
habitats were designated and major infrastructure was
directed away from the districts.
Ottawa, Canada, with a population under
900,000, offers a good example of concordance
between urban vision and transportation investments. The 1974 plan called for a multi-centred
urban structure, with five directional corridors of
future growth emanating from the city centre.
Ottawa’s leaders began with a concept plan that
defined desired growth axes, thereafter invested in a
high-quality, high-capacity busway to drive growth
along these corridors. A combination of land-use
regulations and incentives (e.g. targeted infrastructure investments) channelled commercial and employment growth to the busway corridors. The plan
mandated, for example, that all shopping centres over
354,000 square metres gross leasable space had to be
sited near the busway or future extensions. Transportation demand management measures such as
mandatory parking charges were also introduced. In
2007, Ottawa adopted guidelines that called for
building designs and set-backs that create attractive
human-scale development; public art to enliven
station areas; and short street blocks to make it easier
and more enjoyable for pedestrians to access busway
stations.56 Since 1990, the public transport’s mode
share in Ottawa has remained steady at 15 per cent
of daily trips, while declining in nearly all other
Canadian cities.57

The two examples above of where the urbanform ‘horse’ leads the transportation ‘cart’, with
transport investments that have been used as tools
to create hoped-for outcomes. Similarly, local authorities can utilise a range of tools to influence urban
growth such as land-use regulations; infrastructure
investments; tax policies (e.g. enterprise districts);
and land purchases (e.g. greenbelts). However,
experience shows that transportation investments are
one of the most important.58 This is particularly the
case in fast-growing cities with vibrant economies,
worsening traffic congestion and a high pent-up
demand for mobility. Arguably, ‘transport-land use
links are the most important ones in infrastructure
plans and thus should take precedence’.59
Rather than being site or corridor specific about
where growth should take place, and in what form,
some cities opt to advance principles and ideals,
expressed in fairly general terms, about desired
growth. This is often in the form of strategic spatial
plans that contain long-range directives and conceptual ideas, as opposed to detailed spatial designs.60
An example is Barcelona’s recent strategic plan,
which calls for maintaining a compact urban form,
preserving the city’s legacy of high-quality urban
design and keeping the city walkable.61 The plan
provides a framework for this vision to be refined and
set into motion, through a series of local multisectoral projects, such as housing development and
brownfield redevelopment, as well as proactive investments in sustainable transportation infrastructure.62
With a population similar to Atlanta’s, Barcelona’s
longstanding commitment to planning and designing
a compact, mixed-use walkable city has produced a
spatial coverage and carbon footprint that is only a
fraction of Atlanta’s (Figure 5.12). The short distances
created by a compact city have meant that 20 per
cent of trips made by Barcelonans are by foot.63
In developing countries, long-term strategic
plans governing the growth of cities tend to be
less clearly defined. In its ‘Accessible Ahmedabad’
plan, the city of Ahmedabad (India) embraced the
principle of creating a city designed for accessibility
rather than mobility, without specific details on
the siting of new growth.64 The plan calls for guid-

ing development and investing in transportation so
as to: (1) reduce the need for travel; (2) reduce the
length of travel; and (3) promote the use of public
transport and non-motorized vehicles to reduce car
dependence. The city’s BRT system forms the backbone of Ahmedabad’s evolving transportation network. A better articulation to urban development was
needed to make ‘accessibility’ a key element of
mobility and city growth.
Planning the accessible city also involves
increasing the percentage of urban land allocated to
streets, to enhance connectivity. Studies show that
the overall connectivity of the city can be measured
by proxy, by comparing the ratio of urban land
allocated to streets with the total land area of the
city.65 Current trends indicate that the bulk of urban
population growth is occurring in developing countries, most of which have a limited street and other
infrastructure required for increased accessibility.
While it is important for these cities to invest in
streets, it should be noted, however, that having a
high percentage of urban land allocated to streets is
only the first step in making a city more accessible.
There is, in addition, a need to take into account the
efficiency of the street system and its adaptability to
essential urban mobility modes such as high-capacity
public transport systems (such as metros or BRTs),
walking and cycling. An efficiently laid out street
system integrates three main variables, namely; the
proportion of land area allocated to streets, the
number of street intersections and the distance
between these intersections. Furthermore, the
hierarchy – arterial, primary and secondary, as well
as bikepaths and footpaths – of the street system
constitutes another essential element of the connectivity matrix for the city, which is a fundamental
aspect of accessible urban mobility systems.66 Each
city thus needs to invest in adequate and well-laid
out street networks, according to its economic,
institutional, social and environmental capacities.
Integrated mobility planning and urban growth
need to occur at multiple spatial scales – e.g. the
region as a whole, districts and corridors, as well
as neighbourhoods. Such multi-level planning is a
centrepiece of Portland, Oregon’s widely celebrated

approach to smart-growth development. There, a
long-term regional vision of multiple, hierarchical
growth centres, interlaced with high-quality public
transport and secondary bikeway/pedway systems, has
been adopted. The formation of an urban growth
boundary has been pivotal to Portland’s efforts to curb
urban sprawl, reduce car-dependence and create a
healthier, more liveable city. This boundary works
at the regional scale, ensuring that future growth is
inward and upward, not outward. The regional scale
best captures the ecological contexts in which cities
exist, and spatially corresponds to fragile resources
such as airsheds and water tributary areas. The
district or corridor scale captures the spatial context
in which many day-to-day economic transactions
take place, such as going to work and shopping for
everyday items. For a public transport corridor, say,
a necklace of pearls urban form (Figure 5.15) might
take shape wherein nodes of mixed-use, public
transport-served centres encourage residents to use
public transport for their daily activities. In the case
of the neighbourhood scale, activities such as convenience shopping, socializing with neighbours and
walking to school usually take place where urban
design approaches such as gridded street patterns and
TOD are targeted. Spatial harmonization between
these three levels – regions, districts/corridors and
neighbourhoods – can be crucial for the successful
integration of transportation and urban development, as experienced in Portland (US) and Curitiba
(Brazil).
The next three sections of this chapter refer to
each of these three scales, namely: neighbourhoods,
corridors and regions. In addition, the directions
of the transportation–urban form relationship are
discussed at these scales. In particular, these sections

look at how urban development and land-use patterns
influence travel, and how transportation investments
and policies influence the growth and shape of the
city. Examples are cited that highlight the successes
and challenges of integrating transportation and
urban development at each scale.

BUILT ENVIRONMENTS
AND TRAVEL AT THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD SCALE
The mobility influences of finer-grain features of
the city – such as the size of city blocks, the layout
of street networks, parking arrangements and the
intermixing of land uses – are best measured at
the neighbourhood scale. Contemporary forms of
smart growth, such as TOD and new urbanism, both
discussed in the next section, aim to place many
daily activities within a five to ten minute walk of
each other. This corresponds to the spatial coverage
of a typical neighbourhood.
Many studies have been conducted on the
potential to reduce motorized travel through changes
in the built environment.67 Analysts often express
features of built environments along five core
dimensions or the ‘5 Ds’: density, diversity, design,
destination accessibility and distance to transit
(Box 5.8). These 5 Ds strongly influence travel
demand – notably, the number of trips made, the
modes chosen and the distances travelled – and are
evident in many contexts and settings.68 Both
singularly and collectively, the 5 Ds affect VKT per
capita.

Box 5.8 5 Ds of built environments that influence travel
•

Density gauges how many people, workers or built
structures occupy a specified land area, such as gross
hectares or residentially zoned land.
Diversity reflects the mix of land uses and the degree to
which they are spatially balanced (e.g. jobs–housing
balance), as well as the variety of housing types and
mobility options (e.g. bikeways and motorways).
Design captures elements such as street layout and
network characteristics that influence the likelihood of
walking or biking – e.g. pedestrian and bike-friendliness.
Street networks vary from dense urban grids of highly
interconnected, straight streets, to sparse suburban
networks of curving streets forming loops and
lollipops.
Destination accessibility measures ease of access to
trip destinations, such as the number of jobs or other
attractions that can be reached within 30 minutes travel
time.

•

Distance to transit is usually measured as the shortest
street routes from the residences or workplaces in an area
to the nearest rail station or bus stop.

These are not separate dimensions and indeed are often codependent. Having high-rise housing and office towers will
yield few mobility benefits if the two activities are far from
each other. A diversity of uses and improved accessibility to
destinations from home or work are needed if denser development is to translate into more pedestrian and transit trips.
City downtown areas are considered the densest part of most
cities. They also tend to be the most diverse in terms of land
use and the most walkable – e.g. small city blocks, complete
sidewalk networks and fine-grain grid street patterns.

Most evidence on this comes from developed
countries. A recent meta-analysis of more than 100
studies in North America, Table 5.1 shows the
average influence of each D factor on VKT, expressed
as elasticities (denoting the per cent change in VKT
for a 1 per cent change in each D factor). The study’s
conclusion is that ‘destination accessibility’ is by far
the most important land use factor that strongly
influences travel – on average, a doubling of access
to destinations (e.g. the number of jobs that can be
reached within 30 minutes by public transport) is
associated with a 20 per cent decline in VKT. Almost
any development in a central, accessible location will
generate less motorized travel than the best-designed,
compact, mixed-use development in a remote
location.
Other attributes that influence travel include:
urban design (e.g. street connectivity and safe,
complete sidewalk provisions) and well-sited pedestrian routes. Box 5.9 describes the importance of
land-use diversity such as level of mixing, which tends
to exert strong influences on travel modes and
distances to the workplace, rather than the residential
end of trips. The rather weak statistical relationship
between density and travel in the US reflects the fact
that density is intertwined with other D variables –
e.g. dense settings commonly have mixed uses, small
city blocks, and central locations, all of which shorten
trips and encourage walking. While individual
elasticities might appear low in Table 5.1, their
influences are additive.
European studies on the 5 Ds and travel, largely
corroborate US experiences. As in the case of the
US, location within a region matters. Isolated neighbourhoods with poor accessibility result in a high
level of car use. A study in Copenhagen, Denmark,
revealed that VKT increased by 30 per cent with a
doubling of distance to the city’s downtown area.69
The importance of road designs and land-use mixes
is revealed by a study of two European cities with
similar land areas and household incomes – the

master-planned British new town, Milton Keynes, and
the more traditional Dutch community, Almere.70
Almere was designed for walking and cycling, while
Milton Keynes is a car-oriented city laid out on a
super-grid of four-lane thoroughfares, separating
homes, offices and shops into different quadrants.
The study found that two-thirds of the out-of-home
trips made by urban residents in Milton Keynes
were by car, compared to 42 per cent in Almere.
In addition, the average trip distances in Almere
were 25 per cent shorter. A more recent comparison
of Milton Keynes with another Dutch masterplanned new town, Houten, that was more consciously designed for bicycle travel revealed greater
differentials. In 2010, 55 per cent of all trips made
by Houten residents were by bike, as compared to
20 per cent of the trips made by urban residents in
Milton Keynes.71
While very little is known about the 5 Ds and
travel in developing countries, evidence is beginning
to trickle in. In Santiago (Chile) evidence revealed
that between 1991 and 2001, the effect of urban
densities on car ownership doubled, with increasing
population densities reducing the likelihood of
households owning a car.72 Being close to a subway
station also reduced car ownership rates. However,
land-use diversity had a minimal influence on travel.

Box 5.9 Land-use diversity
Mixing up land uses can shorten trips and encourage nonmotorized travel. A recent study of six mixed-use activity
centres across the US found that 30 per cent of generated
trips were internal to the project – i.e. short journeys, mainly
by foot. Trips meant for private cars to external destinations
away from the development were instead on-site and often
by foot. Such trips put no strain on the surrounding road
networks and generate relatively few vehicle kilometres of
travel. Unless such benefits are accounted for in traffic impact
studies, the traffic-inducing impacts of mixed-use developments become overstated.
Other benefits of mixed land uses include opportunities
for shared parking and an even distribution of trips (and thus a

91

flatter peak period) throughout the day and week. Situating
employment and entertainment activities close to each
other, for example, means the parking used by white-collar
employees during working hours can also be used in the
evenings and weekends by theatre-goers and restaurant
patrons. In such settings, co-locating land uses whose
parking demands vary by the time and the day of week can
shrink the footprints of impervious parking surfaces by as
much as 35 per cent. Parking regulations and liability laws
might need to be adjusted to allow shared parking among
various activities in mixed-use settings.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

In Colombia, a study of Bogotá residents found that
while density and land-use diversity had very little
influence on the amount of time spent walking
and cycling, neighbourhood design attributes such
as street connectivity and sidewalk provisions had
significant impacts.73 Moving from a neighbourhood in Bogotá with low levels of road connectivity
(measured by the ratio of links to intersections) to
higher levels, resulted in an increased likelihood
(by 220 per cent) that residents walked 30 minutes
or more per day.74 Many of Bogotá’s older neighbourhoods that evolved organically during the precar era had strict zoning laws, thereby resulting in
urban neighbourhoods that exhibit similar densities,
mixes of land use and access to public transit. The
quality of the walking environment varied, however,
and did not strongly influence non-motorized travel.
Similarly, in Taipei and Hong Kong (China) street
designs tend to strongly influence walking, as compared to high densities and mixed land uses (which
are commonplace in both cities).75
The quality of the walking environment has
important age and gender dimensions. In Teheran,
a recent study found highly walkable neighbourhoods to be most conducive to the elderly, resulting
in their walking more often.76 Environments designed
with more street lighting and a mixture of land
uses that generate foot traffic are likely to decrease
the risk of violence to women.77 Further, people of
all ages and genders tend to socialize more and are
physically active in compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods.78 Well-designed streetscapes with destinations
close by tend to draw city residents to sidewalks and
public spaces, creating what urban designers call
‘natural surveillance’ and more ‘eyes on the street’.79
Bogotá’s proactive investment in walkways, plazas and
sidewalks close by, and the city’s connection to the
Transmilenio BRT system has further enhanced public
safety and encouraged households to upgrade their
homes and neighbourhoods.80
Expanded, improved and better connected
pathways are important features of slum upgrading
programmes. In La Vega Barrio, one of Caracas,
Venezuela’s largest and oldest informal settlements,
30 pathways that criss-cross steep hillsides have
been built or rehabilitated to enhance access to jobs,
schools and medical clinics, as part of a major neighbourhood upgrading initiative.81 Design features
such as smaller city blocks can also encourage foot
travel in developing cities. Smaller blocks mean
that trips made by foot are likely to be less circuitous.
In Ahmedabad, India, only 13 per cent of trips made
by those living in neighbourhoods with an average
block size of 4 hectares, were by foot, compared to
the recorded 36 per cent in a similar neighbourhood,
with average block sizes of 1.2 hectares.82
Experiences from China reveal how changes in
built environments fundamentally change travel
in rapidly growing settings. Paralleling China’s shift

to a market economy have been dramatic transformations of urban environments – from a traditional
high-density, pedestrian- and cyclist-oriented urban
form to an increasingly spread-out, auto-oriented
one.83 The liberalization of land markets in the 1990s
resulted in the displacement of many Chinese
working-class households to the periphery – often
to isolated superblock development enveloped by
wide streets.84 The change from organically evolved,
mixed-use enclaves – where many people lived,
worked and shopped in the same area – to caroriented large-block suburbs, dramatically enlarged
households’ travel footprints. A study on the travel
impacts of 900 households that moved from Shanghai’s urban core to isolated, superblock and gated
housing units on the periphery revealed dramatic
shifts from non-motorized to motorized travel and
journeys of far longer duration. This resulted in a
50 per cent increase in VKT from the households
surveyed.85 Another study found that residents
living in higher-density areas in Shanghai, with
smaller blocks and denser street networks averaged
around one-half of the car ownership levels, compared to the urban residents living in more caroriented, superblock districts.86 Moreover, residents
of pedestrian/cycle-friendly neighbourhoods travelled
shorter distances than those of other neighbourhoods, even in cases whereby the travel mode was
the same.
Globally, various neighbourhood designs and
retrofits are being introduced to reduce the need for
travel by private cars and invite more sustainable
forms of mobility. Among these are: traditional neighbourhoods, also known as new urbanism; TOD; and
car-restricted districts.

Traditional neighbourhoods and the new
urbanism
Before the advent of the private car, traditional
neighbourhoods were compact and highly walkable. Daily activities (e.g. shops, restaurants and
schools) that were no more than five minutes away
were characteristic of the pre-automobile era.87
In the early 1980s, an urban design movement,
called ‘new urbanism’, was developed in the US. This
movement sought to return neighbourhoods to
their pre-automobile designs and ambiances – places
that promoted walking, allowed daily face-to-face
interaction of people from all walks of life and provided a range of housing types, workplaces, commercial-retail offerings and public places.88 Diversity and
place-making became catchwords of the movement.89
In contrast to the sameness and sterility of suburban
sprawl, new urbanism emphasized the fine details of
what makes communities enjoyable, distinctive and
functional – such as gridiron street patterns well
suited to walking, prominent civic spaces that draw
people together (and thus help build social capital),

tree-lined skinny streets with curbside parking and
back-lot alleys that slow car traffic, and a mix of
housing types and prices.90
More than 600 new urbanism neighbourhoods have been built, planned or are under construction in the US.91 Most notable is Seaside, Florida,
that was launched in the early 1980s. In Europe, a
number of former brownfield sites have been
redeveloped since the 1980s, based on traditional
versus modernist design principles. One example
is Poundbury, England, on the outskirts of Dorchester.92 Other notable European new urbanism
communities already built or taking form include
Heulebrug (Belgium), Pitiuosa (Greece), Agelada de
Cima (Portugal), Hardelot Plage (France) and Kemer
in Istanbul (Turkey). In developing countries, recent
examples of neighbourhood designs and redevelopment projects that follow new urbanism principles
to varying degrees are Orchid Bay (Belize), Rosetown
outside of Kingston (Jamaica), Timphu (Bhutan) and
Melrose Arch in Johannesburg (South Africa).93
However, these projects mainly cater for the middleor high-income households that can afford the neighbourhood amenities (e.g. civic squares, streetscape
enhancements, etc.) that accompany new urbanist
communities. Accordingly, they have contributed
little to relieving deeply entrenched social problems
such as slums and concentrated poverty.
Among the objectives for designing communities, like those proposed by new urbanism, is
that there will be a reduction in car dependence by
making the communities pleasant places to walk
and cycle. Experience largely bears this out.94 In the
Research Triangle area of North Carolina a study
found that VKT reductions were due to the substitution of out-of-neighbourhood car trips for withinneighbourhood walk trips.95 At similar income levels,
those living in compact, mixed-use ‘traditional’ neigh-

93

bourhoods made as many daily trips as those in lowdensity, single-family suburban neighbourhoods.
However the switch from driving to walking and the
shortening of trip distances resulted in around 20
per cent fewer VKT per household each weekday.

Transit-oriented development (TOD)
TOD is traditional or new urbanism development that
is physically oriented to a public transport station.96
By concentrating a mix of pedestrian-oriented development around public transport nodes, residents
and workers are more likely to catch a train or a bus
for out-of-neighbourhood trips, and walk or bike for
shorter within-neighbourhood trips.97 TODs aim to
function as community hubs, and places where
people not only ‘pass through’ but also choose ‘to
be’ – e.g. for public celebrations and demonstrations,
outdoor concerts, farmers’ markets and other
activities that help build community (Box 5.10).98 If
there is a logical place to concentrate urban growth
and redevelopment, it is around public transport stops
– an idea that planners, politicians and lay-citizens
alike understand. Of course, high-quality, wellconnected public transport service must exist to
draw passengers to the station area in the first place,
thus TOD relies on and implicitly assumes public
transport is safe, reliable and time-competitive with
the private car.99
Increasingly, TOD is globally recognized as a
viable model for shaping urban growth. TOD is most
fully developed in Europe, and particularly in Scandinavia. Step one in making TOD a reality is the
formulation of a vision and conceptual image of the
future metropolis, such as Copenhagen’s celebrated
‘finger plan’ and Stockholm’s ‘necklaces of pearls’
(Figure 5.16). In both these cities, corridors for
channelling overspill growth from the urban centres

Box 5.10 Transit-oriented development
The term TOD refers to compact, mixed-use, pedestrianfriendly development that is ‘oriented’, and not just adjacent
to, urban rail and busway stations. Besides being the ‘jumping
off’ point for catching a train or bus, TOD also serves other
community purposes. In the Scandinavian model, TOD is
characterized by a large civic square that functions as a
community’s hub – a gathering place for public events, such as
open-air concerts, farmers’ markets, public demonstrations
and civic celebrations. Thus, TOD can serve both functional
and symbolical purposes, as the centrepiece of communities.
Experience shows that the Scandinavian approach to TOD
designs can have significant benefits to communities such as:
increasing public transport ridership; providing mobility
choices; increasing public safety; reducing air pollution and
energy consumption rates; building social capital; and
increasing commerce and economic activities.

were defined early in the planning process, and rail
infrastructure was built, often in advance of demand,
to steer growth along desired growth axes.
Traditionally, few cities in developing countries
were public-transport oriented, featuring fine-grain
mixes of land uses, plentiful pathways for pedestrians
and cyclists, and ample transit services on major
roads. In Latin America, TOD is being planned or has
taken form to varying degrees around BRT stations
in Curitiba (Brazil), Santiago (Chile) and Guatemala
City. Other noteworthy experiences with bus-based
TOD can be found in Asian cities such as Kaoshiung,
Qingdao and Jiaxing (China) and Kuala Lumpur
(Malaysia).
Many cities in China are looking to TOD in order
to manage growth and capitalize upon massive rail
and BRT investments. Recently, Beijing and Guangzhou adopted TOD as a guiding design principle in
their long-range master plans.100 However, failure to
articulate densities (e.g. tapering building heights
with distances from stations), the siting of stations
in isolated superblocks and poor pedestrian access
have undermined TOD efforts in many Chinese
cities.101 Over the past two decades, Beijing’s investment in a massive 372-kilometre subway metro
network has seen housing projects gravitate to rail
corridors outside of the urban core, with a few
jobs and consumer services following suit.102 Many
rail-served neighbourhoods have become veritable
dormitory communities, skewing commuting patterns. A study of three residential neighbourhoods
in Beijing’s rail-served northern suburbs found as
many as nine times the number of rail passengers
heading inbound in the morning peak as those rail
passengers heading outbound.103 In addition, poor
integration of station designs with the surrounding
development has produced chaotic pedestrian
circulation patterns and long passenger queues at
suburban stations.104
Evidence on how TOD has influenced travel and
environmental quality comes mainly from the US.
There, studies show that TODs can reduce car use
per capita by half, thus saving households around
20 per cent of their income since they have, on
average, one less car or often none.105 Typically,
TOD residents in the US commute by transit four
to five times more than the average commuter in a
region.106 Similar ridership bonuses have been
recorded for TOD projects in Toronto, Vancouver,
Singapore and Tokyo.107 In China, a recent study
found smaller differentials of around 25 per cent in
rail commuting between those living near versus away
from suburban rail stations.108
While TOD planning tends to focus on residences, experience from the US shows that concentrating jobs around rail stops in well-designed,
pedestrian-friendly settings can exert even stronger
influences on the choice of travel mode.109 The
location of TOD in a region and the quality of con-

necting public transport services can strongly influence the choice of travel mode. A TOD as an island
in a sea of auto-oriented development will have little
influence on travel.

Traffic-calmed and car-restricted
neighbourhoods
Many European cities have brought liveability and
pedestrian safety to the forefront of transportation
planning. Initiatives have sought to tame and reduce
dependence on the private car.110 Traffic calming
is one such example, pioneered by Dutch planners
who have added speed humps, realigned roads,
necked down intersections and planted trees and
flowerpots in the middle of streets to slow down
traffic. With traffic calming, the street becomes an
extension of a neighbourhood’s liveable space – a
place to walk, chat and play. Car passage becomes
secondary. After traffic calming its streets in the early
1990s, the city of Heidelberg, Germany, witnessed
a 31 per cent reduction in accidents and 44 per cent
fewer casualties.111
An even bolder policy in the same direction has
been the outright banning of cars from the core
of traditional neighbourhoods and districts, complemented by an upgrading and beautification of
pedestrian spaces. This practice has become commonplace in many older European cities, whose narrow
and winding inner-city streets were not designed for
motorized traffic. Today, car-free historical districts
thrive in Athens (Greece), Seville (Spain), Lübeck
and Bremen (Germany), Bologna and Siena (Italy) and
Bruges (Belgium), as well as substantial portions of
university towns such as Groningen and Delft (the
Netherlands), Oxford and Cambridge (UK) and Freiburg and Münster (Germany). Extended pedestrianonly shopping streets and promenades have also
gained popularity, such as Copenhagen’s Strøget
(Denmark), Lisbon’s Baixa (Portugal) and Gamla Stan
in old town Stockholm (Sweden). Similarly, multiblock car-free streets and enhanced pedestrian zones
are also found in developing-country cities, including
Curitiba, Brazil (20 city blocks), Buenos Aires, Argentina (12 blocks of Florida Street and several car-free
waterfront redevelopment projects), Guadalajara,
Mexico (15 downtown streets) and Beirut, Lebanon
(much of the historical core). Entire residential
communities, either newly built or redeveloped,
that are car-restricted can be found such as Vauban
(Box 7.12) and Rieselfeld outside of Freiburg (Germany), Amsterdam’s GWL Terrein brownfield redevelopment (the Netherlands), Vienna’s Mustersiedling
Floridsdorf housing project (Austria), Munich’s
Kolumbusplatz neighbourhood (Germany), the
Stellwerk 60 project in Cologne (Germany) and
Masdar City outside of Abu Dhabi (United Arab
Emirates).112

Some European communities have opted for
traffic calming measures using cellular neighbourhood
designs that require motorists to follow round-about
routes, while providing direct connections to cyclists
and pedestrians when going from one cell to another.
One example is Houten, a master-planned, largely
bedroom community of 41,000 inhabitants south
of Utrecht (the Netherlands), which was designed
and built to prioritize travel by bicycle and walking.
Despite some initial uneasiness by business merchants, residents and politicians, global experiences
with creating car-free districts, auto-restricted neighbourhoods and pedestrian-only streets have generally
been positive. However, consideration needs to be
made to ensure that high-quality and frequent public
transport services are in place to absorb displaced
car traffic. A study of pedestrianization in German
cities recorded increases in pedestrian flows, public
transport ridership, land values and retail sales
transactions (Table 5.2), as well as property conversions to more intensive land uses, matched by
fewer traffic accidents and fatalities.113 A study of over
100 cases of road-capacity reductions (e.g. car-free
zones, pedestrian-street conversions as well as street
and bridge closures) in developed countries found
an average overall reduction in motorized traffic of
25 per cent, even after controlling for possible
increased travel on parallel routes. This ‘evaporated’
traffic represented a combination of people forsaking
low-value, discretionary trips and opting for alternative modes, including public transport, walking and
cycling.114

CORRIDOR CONTEXTS
A transportation ‘corridor’ consists of ‘one or more
primary transportation facilities that constitute a
single pathway for the flow of people and goods
within and between activity centers, as well as the
abutting land uses and supporting street network’.115
Corridors represent the spatial context in which
significant challenges are often faced in coordinating transportation and land development across
multiple jurisdictions. They are also where ‘access

management’ – trading off the mobility versus siteaccess functions of roads – can pose significant policy
challenges, particularly in fast-growing cities and
regions.116 If well planned and designed, corridors
also present a spatial context for designing a network
of TODs.

Mobility and development trade-offs
Transportation corridors function to move people
and goods but often face intense development pressures that over time can erode their mobility function.117 Experiences show that building motorways
without carefully managing urban growth is a surefire recipe for future traffic tie-ups.118 This is particularly the case of developing country cities. New
roadways open up access to new territories, spawning building construction and land development
and thus more traffic.119 In Sub-Saharan Africa, road
improvements have stimulated the local production
of cash crops, spurring urbanization in secondary
towns where farmers sell their products and buy
services and imported goods.120 Access to port cities
is especially crucial since most African trade is transoceanic. A study of 287 cities in 15 African countries
found that cities relatively closer (465 kilometres)
to a major port via paved roads grew 6 per cent faster,
between 2002 and 2008, than otherwise similar
cities.121 Another study of proposed road upgrades
between northeast Congo and the Central African
Republic estimated that, in addition to stimulating
urban growth, goods traded via this route would
increase from a current value of US$16 million to
US$142 million, nearly 800 per cent increase.122
The study concluded that trade expansion promoted
by the upgrading would exceed costs by about
US$220 billion over a period of 15 years.
With time, induced economic growth and new
urbanization generates new trips, congesting roadways. Unless such growth is properly managed, economic and urbanization benefits will diminish.123
Effectively, the roadway’s role and function transforms from one of providing mobility to providing
site access (Figure 5.14). The two are in fundamental

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

and auxiliary lanes are common in wealthier countries
where sufficient rights of way have been preserved
to accommodate them. However, these can be difficult to build in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia because
of land constraints. Limited-access toll-ways can also
be built to allow those willing to pay for travel-time
savings to avoid local congestion.127
In lieu of supply-side corridor-management
responses (e.g. construction of frontage roads and
curb-cut restrictions), corridor-level growth management plans that link land use to new or expanded
improvements can also be developed. Both land
development and transport infrastructure need years
for implementation. Therefore, coordinated and strategic long-range planning is essential. Once a transport investment is committed and land-use policies
are adopted, the two can co-evolve over time.
Freeways and rail systems can complement
rather than compete with each other through multimodal corridor planning and design.128 In the suburbs
of Munich (Germany), suburban trains and motorways are physically integrated to allow motorists to
efficiently switch to trains. Large digital screens
inform motorists of downstream traffic speeds and
expected travel times for reaching the city centre via
train.129

conflict. High corridor access, marked by frequent
driveways, curb cuts and slow-moving cars accessing/
exiting sites interferes with through-traffic movements. Further, travel speeds decline and accident
levels increase. The problem is often accentuated
when different institutions control infrastructure
and land development along the corridor. If a national
government or state builds a new road to improve
cross-city traffic flows, the intention of local governments is to take advantage of the added capacity by
allowing new development – a means to grow the
local economy and generate property tax income.124
Such scenarios whereby localities exploit newly
provided roadway infrastructure, in order to leverage
new growth and increase tax revenues at the expense
of intercity mobility, are particularly problematic in
parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern Asia.125
One approach to mitigating unintended consequences is improved corridor access management.126
This can be done through growth management,
road designs, price signals or other policy instruments
(e.g. license-plate restrictions on travel). An example
of a road-design response is the construction of
frontage roads that separate through-moving traffic
from local, slower-moving traffic. This is a common
practice in North America and Europe. Front roads

Some cities have directed land uses that are scattered
throughout suburbia – e.g. housing, offices, shops,
restaurants, strip malls – to corridors served by
public transport.130 Scandinavian cities such as Stockholm (Sweden), Helsinki (Finland) and Copenhagen
(Denmark) have created networks of linked TODs
– that is, public transport-oriented corridors. This
‘necklace of pearls’ built form (Figure 5.15) not only
induces public transport riding but can also produce
balanced, bi-directional flows (and thus more efficient
use of infrastructure) through land-use intermixing.
While some stations have a balance of land uses,
others are more specialized, functioning as either
employment centres or residential communities.
However, within the 10–15 kilometre linear corridors
served by rail, one finds a balance of jobs, housing,
retail and population services. Consequently, there
are multi-directional flows of traffic during peak
hours. Public transport is efficiently used in both
directions, rather than the asymmetrical flows found
in imbalanced settings.
Greater Stockholm has evolved along public
transport-oriented corridors. During the last halfcentury, strategic regional planning has given rise to
regional settlement and commutation patterns
that have substantially lowered car-dependency in
Stockholm’s middle-income suburbs.131 The city’s
investment in radial rail lines has produced a
necklace-of-pearls urban form and a balanced use of
land for work and housing. A number of mixed-use

neighbourhoods dot the region’s extensive radial rail
network, interspersed by lower-density development
and open space (Figure 5.16). Stockholm planners
consciously created jobs–housing–retail balance along
rail-served axial corridors, leading to a high share of
trips self-contained within sub-regional corridors,
and a directional balance of travel flows during
peak hours. Less cross-hauling from one quadrant of
the region to another has reduced traffic burdens
on the region’s transportation networks and rationalized travel flows to produce short-to-moderate
distance trips that are well served by railway and fastbus services. This has resulted in high modal splits
for public transport (higher than in larger rail-served
cities such as Berlin, Germany; and London, UK) and
comparatively low CO2 emissions per capita in the
transport sector (lower than Tokyo, Japan; New York,
US; and Rome, Italy).132 Most residents in Stockholm
use public transport to commute to work, and
selectively use private cars for grocery shopping or
when travelling on long weekend excursions.
Curitiba, Brazil, one of the world’s most sustainable, well-planned cities, is another text-book
example of successful public transport-oriented corridors, albeit using a lower-cost public transport
technology than in Stockholm, namely: BRT. By
emphasizing planning for people rather than cars,
Curitiba has evolved along well-defined radial axes
lineal corridors that are intensively served by dedicated busways. Along some corridors, streams of

double-articulated buses haul 16,000 passengers
per hour, comparable to what much pricier metrorail systems carry. The city’s current system of 390
routes served by 2000 vehicles carries 2.1 million
passengers per day, double the count of 15 years ago.
To ensure a public transport-oriented built form,
Curitiba’s government mandates that all medium- and
large-scale urban development be sited along a BRT
corridor.
A design element used to enhance accessibility
and ensure balanced corridor growth in Curitiba is
the ‘trinary’ – three parallel – roadways with compatible land uses and building heights that taper with
distance from the BRT corridor (Figure 5.17). Zoning
ordinances and urban design standards promote
ridership productivity and environmental quality.
The first two floors of buildings along the busway
– which do not count against permissible plot ratios
(building height/land area) – are devoted to retail
uses. Above the second floor, buildings must set back
at least 5 metres from property line to allow sun to
cast on the busway. The inclusion of upper-level
housing entitles property owners to density bonuses,
leading to vertical mixing of uses within buildings. Further, the higher densities produced by
the trinary design have resulted in increased ridership. Concentrated commercial development has
also channelled trips from residences beyond BRT
terminuses to the trinary corridors. In 2009, for
example, 78.4 per cent of trips boarding at the ter-

VKT per capita (7900) was only half as much as in
Brazil’s national capital Brasília, a city with a similar
population size and income level but a sprawling, autocentric built form.136 Based on 2002 data,
Curitiba’s estimated annual congestion cost per
capita of US$0.67 is only a fraction of São Paulo’s
(US$7.34).137 The strong, workable nexus that exists
between Curitiba’s bus-based public transport system
and its mixed-use linear settlement pattern deserves
most of the credit.
Sustained political commitment has been an
important part of Curitiba’s success. The harmonization of transport and land use took place over 40
years of political continuity, with forward-looking,
like-minded mayors who built on the work of their
predecessors.138 A cogent long-term vision and the

Figure 5.18 shows daily ridership at stops along

that when densities increase, so does public transport ridership. In addition, the mixing of land uses
along the trinary corridors has produced bi-directional
flows, ensuring efficient use of bus capacity.
The mobility and environmental benefits from
Curitiba’s three-plus decades of integrated development along public transport corridors are well
celebrated. Curitiba has Brazil’s highest public transport mode splits (45 per cent), the lowest congestionrelated economic losses and lowest rate of urban
air pollution (despite being an industrial city).134
On a per capita basis, Curitiba is one of Brazil’s
wealthiest cities, yet it averages considerably more

crucial in allowing the city to chart a sustainable urban
pathway.
In recent years, Curitiba has begun to experience the limits of rubber-tire technologies. With
buses operating on 30-second intervals on main
routes during the peak hour, bunching problems have
disrupted and slowed services. Veritable elephanttrains of buses have increased operating costs and
precluded the kinds of economies of scale enjoyed
by single-driver operated trains. Extreme overcrowding has prompted many middle-class choice travellers
to switch to driving.140 A long-discussed light-rail line,
to replace overcrowded buses, has yet to gain
momentum due to cost concerns.141
Curitiba has also been criticized for giving short
shrift to intermodal connections to BRT corridors.
Only six of the city’s 22 BRT stations, for example,
are connected by dedicated bicycle paths, which is
a smaller share than Bogotá’s Transmilenio BRT.142

REGIONAL CONTEXT
Cities have grown and spilled beyond their walls
and jurisdictional boundaries for centuries. However,
the development of city clusters and large urban
agglomerations is more recent. The modern approach
to new town development began with Ebenezer
Howard’s concept of the ‘Garden City’ in 1898,
leading to the evolution of Letchworth and Welwyn
Garden City.143 This development was followed by
the UK new towns movement in the late 1940s,
which has since been emulated in many countries,
particularly in the building of new national capitals
such as Canberra (Australia), Dodoma (Tanzania)
and New Delhi (India), which are designed as cluster
or regional cities. Many countries, especially China,
have adopted new towns as the preferred planning approaches previously adopted in European and
US cities.144 For example, Shanghai has developed
extensive plans for its metropolitan region. Other
Asian cities, such as Delhi (India), Kuala Lumpur
(Malaysia) and Jakarta (Indonesia), are perusing
new town approaches to the planning and development of their region based on clusters. Navi Mumbai,
adjacent to the Indian city of Mumbai, is being
planned as the largest new town in the world.145 Latin
American cities such as Buenos Aires (Argentina), Rio
de Janeiro (Brazil), Santiago (Chile) and Mexico City
have also adopted new town approaches to regional
development based on clusters. The concept of city
cluster development was applied to the planning of
Abuja (Nigeria) and Brasília (Brazil), Shanghai (China),
Mumbai (India) and Hanoi (Viet Nam), promoting
cross-river expansion into new urban growth areas.
Growth triangles, such as in Singapore, Jahor Baru
(Malaysia) and Bintan (Indonesia), and Shenzhen,
Hong Kong and Macau (China), are examples of
network planning approaches based on a regional
agglomeration concept.

99

Connectivity and large urban
configurations
Cities of different sizes have increasingly started to
merge and form new spatial configurations that
typically take three principal forms, namely: megaregions, urban corridors and city regions. These
forms act as nodes where global and regional flows
of people, capital, goods and information combine
and commingle, resulting in faster growth, both
demographic and economic, than the growth of the
countries where they are located.146 Connectivity and
regional transport are crucial for the development of
these large agglomerations.
In some cases, large cities such as Cairo (Egypt),
Mexico City or Bangalore (India) are creating large
urban configurations in which they dominate the
surrounding regional space, amalgamating other
cities and towns within their economic orbit. In
other cases, two or more large cities, such as Mumbai
and Delhi in India; São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in
Brazil; or Ibadan, Lagos (Nigeria) and Accra (Ghana)
form transport corridors for the purposes of industrial development, business services and trade.
Still, in other cases, the government creates planned
‘supra-agglomerations’ as part of a regional and
national development strategy. This is the case in
China, where the Guangdong Provincial Government
recently announced the development of the Pearl
River Delta mega-region, which would include nine
large cities, with an aggregate surface area of 40,000
square kilometres, and an impressive transport infrastructure (Box 5.11). Similarly, the large economically prosperous cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou
have invested in infrastructure to connect peripheral
towns and enhance the large urban configuration.147
Such large urban configurations, grouped in
networks of cities, amplify the benefits of economies
of agglomeration, increasing efficiencies and enhancing connectivity. They also generate economies of
scale that are beneficial in terms of labour markets,
as well as transport and communication infrastructure, which in turn increases local consumer demand.

City cluster variances and transport
responses
There are significant differences in the patterns of
city clusters between regions and sub-regions. These
are explained by factors related to geography, climate,
population size, natural resources, culture, land
management, political history, infrastructure, markets
and levels of development. In addition, they are also
defined by economic activities and the roles played
by transport and connectivity.
In Europe, urban and regional planning has had
much more influence than in any other region of the
world. Large urban configurations have been located
along major transport routes that use multi-modal

Megacities have become so large that some countries have moved to
planning supra-cities. These are network cities with populations of over 40
million. In 2010, the Guangdong Provincial Government in China announced
it was planning to create the world’s biggest ‘mega-city’ by merging nine
cities into a mega-region metropolis. The new megacity would incorporate a
large part of China’s manufacturing heartland, and stretch in an arc from
Zhuhai to Shenzhen and include the cities of Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan,

networks that integrate land, sea and air transport
systems. The Trans-European Transport Network
(TEN-T) has constituted a key element in boosting
competitiveness and employment through a better
connectivity that allows goods and people to circulate
quickly and easily for higher economic, social and
territorial cohesion.148 TEN-T is working to improve
citizens’ quality of life and strengthening the econ omy by promoting sustainable urban mobility and
increased use of clean energy-efficient vehicles.149
The regional infrastructure looks at specific intermodal platforms at city level for better mobility and
connectivity at different scales.
Large urban configurations in Europe have
emerged as specialized industrial and business
centres along key transport routes. However, these
urban configurations have populations that are less
dense than their counterparts in developing regions.
Many European capital cities have become so called
supra-clusters150 of cities, with massive integrated
national transport systems and the national capital
as a hub. Eastern and Southern European city clusters

are becoming much more dispersed, taking the
form of regional city dominated clusters. Cities
such as Warsaw (Poland) and Moscow (Russia) have
expanded in a concentric pattern from the historic
city centre. Moscow has many features similar to
Beijing (China) and Dallas (US), with an expanding
ring road system and decentralized employment and
residential development.
City clustering in North American cities,
particularly in the US, is the result of massive investment in freeway systems and planned urban/regional
development, with dispersed urban settlement patterns and specialized functions. Most cities in these
large urban configurations have populations of over
1 million, and the typical morphology is polycentric
in terms of both urban form and economic structure.
Most North American cities have well-established
central business districts. However, an increasing
proportion of economic and employment activities
is occurring outside these areas. The Washington
DC region, for example, has expanded as a large
polycentric city into adjacent Maryland and Virginia.

It is made up of cluster or sub-regional global employment centres located near the intersection of the
beltway and freeway systems. This is repeated in
cities such as Dallas, Boston, San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Chicago, to name just a few.
A network of strategic highways made up of
260,000 kilometres, known as the National Highway System, connects major airports, ports, rail or
truck terminals, railway stations, pipeline terminals
and other strategic transport facilities in the US.
Although the system includes 4 per cent of the
nation’s roads, it carries more than 40 per cent of
the highway traffic, 75 per cent of heavy truck traffic
and 90 per cent of tourist traffic. All urban areas
with a population of over 50,000 and about 90 per
cent of America’s population live within 8 kilometres
of the network, which is the longest in the world.151
Inter-city or high-speed rail systems in the US are
undersized, with only one high-speed rail line in
operation. The Acela Express runs between Washington and Boston via New York City (633 kilometres).
As a result of the dispersed population and great
distance between major cities, high-speed rail in the
US is of less value than air or car travel. In comparison, China with its high population densities has
a high-speed railway network that spans over more
than 8300 kilometres already in service, and about
17,000 kilometres under construction.152
Large urban agglomerations in Asia are more
dispersed and less well planned. Densities of large
urban agglomerations in newly industrialized countries are typically much higher – over 15,000 persons
per square kilometre – but in city regions, they
can be twice as high, particularly in inner-city areas.
Large urban configurations are becoming more
specialized, including industrial cluster development
(high technology and traditional manufacturing)
and services (health, technology and transport). There
is significant variance in the city cluster development in Asian sub-regions. The lack of basic services,
overcrowding and high levels of congestion and
pollution in South, Central and South-Eastern Asia
have led to a dispersed pattern of urban city cluster
development, with industrial/commercial development moving out from the congested inner-city
areas. Cities in these sub-regions are becoming
much bigger, more decentralized and specialized.
Some cities, such as Manila (the Philippines), Delhi
(India) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), have well
developed sub-metropolitan centres of employment,
including commercial centres and large export enterprise zones. However, the links and integration of
transportation systems and services between the
city centres are poor. Uncontrolled leapfrogging of
urban development and satellite city develop
ment has occurred unabatedly in most cities in these
sub-regions. As a result, urban densities across these
city clusters are rapidly declining, with some cities

recording annual decreases in density rates of more
than 3 per cent.153
Based on the regional planning principle to use
large cities to drive the development of small cities,
China has pursued its strategy of spatial concentration of urban population and industries. Clusters
of cities are grouped along the horizontal axes of
Longhai Railway (Lianyungang–Lanzhou) and the
coastal area of China, along Beijing–Guangzhou and
Beijing–Harbin Railways and Baotou–Kunming transportation corridors, respectively. Africa has very few
large urban configurations. Those in existence tend
to be linear along transport corridors or coastal
trading routes (e.g. the Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire)–
Accra (Ghana)–Lagos (Nigeria) corridor) and major
arterial roads between adjacent provincial cities
(Johannesburg–Pretoria, South Africa, and Lagos–
Ibadan, Nigeria). The Abidjan–Lagos coastal corridor
(998 kilometres) links some of the largest and
economically most dynamic capitals in Africa, such
as Abidjan, Accra, Lomé, Cotonou and Lagos. The corridor serves a population of over 35 million people
with up to 10,000 people and several thousand
vehicles crossing borders daily, accounting for the
highest traffic in West and Central Africa.154 These
corridors are not properly planned. As a result, transport services are poor and so are infrastructure and
transport logistics. Employment in these areas is
driven primarily by trading, natural resources and
low-level services. The typical pattern combines high
population density in inner cities and low densities
in outer areas. Eastern, Middle and Southern African
large urban agglomerations tend to form into lowdensity urban cluster development, dispersed over
large peri-urban areas. This results in poor connectivity and nascent transport infrastructure.
Despite having the highest proportion of urban
population in the world, Latin American and the
Caribbean region has very few large urban configurations. Initially, the historic pattern of urbanization
was monocentric. However, with the development
of secondary cities and better connectivity, a city
cluster pattern has emerged resulting in a polycentric
urban growth. Recently, a small number of megaregions have emerged, such as the one that stretches
from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) that is home
to 43 million people. This mega-region is mainly
served by road and commercial flights, though there
is a project to develop a high-speed train in the near
future. City regions such as Rio de Janeiro, Santiago
(Chile) and Caracas (Venezuela) are constrained by
physical geography, leading to spillover corridor
development along valleys and inter-provincial
highways. Various other large cities are growing in
a diffuse, low-density pattern with peripheral industrial development and housing.

Just as urban form and land-use patterns shape
transportation, transportation investments shape
urban form. The opening of a new road or public
transport line influences the locations, intensities and
types of development as well as the value of land. It
is the changes in accessibility, not the physical infrastructure itself, that drive urban-form and land-use
changes, following transportation infrastructure
investments. Matching the infrastructure hardware
with supportive policy software is essential, if hopedfor land-use outcomes are to follow. Supportive
policies might include permissive zoning that allows
densification near metro-rail stations, or complementary expansion of sewerage/water-supply trunk
line capacities that accommodate new growth.
The section below reviews the impacts of public
transport investments on urban form. This is followed
by discussions of motorways and their urban development impacts. Collectively, experiences show that
transportation is a necessary but hardly a sufficient
precondition for land-use changes.

Impacts of public transport investments
History shows that urban rail systems, like metros
and light rail, are potential city-shapers.155 They often
define the growth spines and axes of cities, leading
to higher density concentrations of industries,
offices and businesses along rail-served corridors.
Rail-based public transport investments – matched
by frequent, high-quality services – strengthen the
economic primacy of central-city locations. They
also spur sub-centring and decentralization, and

are contingent on levels of proactiveness in leveraging new development and minimizing the growthrestricting impacts of onerous regulations (Figure
5.20).156 In cities such as Toronto (Canada), Portland
(US) and Munich (Germany), regional governing
systems help orchestrate TOD through a combination of regulation and incentive-based policies (e.g.
assistance with land assembly and underwriting development costs in redevelopment districts). The new
rail systems in these cities have attracted significant
shares of new developments to station areas.157
Public transport investments in rail-based services exert their strongest spatial influence in large,
congested cities.158 While most empirical knowledge
is drawn from developed countries, theory suggests
that the city-shaping impacts of new rail investments
in developing countries might be stronger. This is due
to rapid rates of population growth and motorization,
high levels of congestion (and thus a pent-up demand
for siting new development in accessibility-enhanced
locations) and rising disposable incomes. In developing-country cities, however, weak institutions for
regional-scale planning and an orientation toward
near-term project investments versus long-term
strategic planning are working against successful
public transport and land-use integration.159
Often, rail-based public transport investments
end up being a stronger force toward decentralization
than concentration, by adding new layers of accessibility to outlying settings (Figure 5.20). While growth
might be funnelled in a particular direction as a result
of a new public transport line, more often than not,
this direction will be outward.160 Metro-rail investments in Santiago, Mexico City and other Latin
American cities have also contributed to the segregation of households by income and class, displacing
the urban poor to the metropolitan periphery, while
modernizing and opening the inner city to wealthier
segments of the population.161 Critics argue that such
mal-distributive impacts are rooted in transportation investments that favour the mobility interests
of wealthier individuals. This situation is further
exacerbated by lack of compensatory programmes,
such as affordable housing requirements, to moderate
such displacements.162 A more balanced portfolio of
transportation improvements that ensures benefits
accrue to all socioeconomic groups can help mitigate
such unintended consequences. The desire to better
serve the mobility needs of the poor partly explains
Bogotá’s proactive investments in world-class BRT and
bikeway networks over the past decade.163
Global experiences show that a number of
preconditions are necessary for urban public transport investments to spawn sustainable urban-form
outcomes. Some of these are outlined in Box 5.12,
and are based on insights from a number of empirical
studies on the impacts of high-capacity public transport systems on urban form in both developed and
developing countries.

Box 5.12 Prerequisites to urban-form changes
Proactive planning is necessary if decentralized growth is
to take the form of sub-centres. Whether decentralized
growth takes a multi-centred form rests largely with the
degree of public commitment to strategic station-area
planning, carried out on a regional scale. Experiences in cities
such as Toronto (Canada), Stockholm (Sweden), Munich
(Germany), Hong Kong (China) and Singapore show that an
aggressive stand to leverage the benefits of rail services can
lead to more concentrated forms of decentralized growth.
Given public-resource commitments, railways and busways
do not only strengthen the core but also produce multiple
sub-centres.
Railways and busways can spur central-city
redevelopment under the right conditions. When
government agencies are willing to absorb some of the
risks inherent in redeveloping economically stagnant
neighbourhoods, public transport can help attract private
capital and breathe new life into struggling areas, as revealed
in large cities such as Tokyo (Japan), Hong Kong (China),
London (UK), San Francisco Bay Area and metropolitan
Washington (US).
Other pro-development measures must accompany public
transport investments. In addition to financial incentives,
experiences show that supportive policies and public actions
must be in place to leverage land development. Foremost
among these are:
•
•
•
•
•

•

permissive and incentive zoning (e.g. density bonuses);
the availability of nearby vacant or easy-to-assemble and
developable parcels;
support for land-use changes among local residents (i.e.
organized opposition and NIMBY forces);
a hospitable physical setting (in terms of aesthetics, ease of
pedestrian circulation and a healthy neighbourhood image);
complementary public improvements (e.g. upgrading of
sidewalks, expansion of water and sanitation trunk-line
capacities and burying utilities);
an absence of physical constraints (e.g. pre-emption of land
development by park-and-ride lots or the siting of a station
in a busy freeway median).

Public transport and land price
appreciation
Accessibility benefits conferred by rail systems get
capitalized into land prices. Higher values of railserved parcels in turn exert market pressures to
intensify land development. Land-value premiums of
commercial parcels within walking distance of metrorail stations are sometimes as high as 100 per cent
in the downtowns of some large cities.164 A survey
of 150 rail projects in the US, UK and Europe found
that public transport services generated positive
effects on residential as well as commercial proper-

Public transport service incentives and private car
‘equalizers’ (disincentives)a help induce station-area landuse changes. The provision of frequent and reliable rail and
feeder bus connections is needed if private capital is to be
enticed to station areas. Only then will railways become timecompetitive with the private car. Such pro-public transport
measures often need to be accompanied by ‘equalizer’
policiesa that remove many of the built-in incentives to drive,
such as the availability of plentiful, low-cost parking.
Congestion pricing in Singapore, Stockholm (Sweden) and
London (UK) partly explains why railway services in these
cities are heavily patronized and not unrelated, and why new
land development is occurring around these cities’ rail stations.
The combination of TOD and transportation demand
management can be especially powerful, yielding synergistic
benefits, as suggested by experiences in Singapore,
Copenhagen (Denmark), Stockholm and Ottawa (Canada).
Network effects matter. For fixed-guideway public transport
systems (e.g. railways and BRT systems with exclusive rights of
way) to induce large-scale land-use changes, it is essential that
they mimic the geographic coverage and regional accessibility
of their chief competitors, limited-access freeways and
highways. Good intermodal connections between high-capacity
public transport systems and secondary systems, like bus and
paratransit feeders, serve to extend the spatial reach of
backbone systems. The strong city-shaping influences of
metros in Paris (France), London (UK) and Tokyo (Japan) are,
to a large extent, a result of such network effects, wherein
railways serve shares of origin-destination combinations that
are comparable to freeway and motorway networks. The
addition of a new railway or BRT line creates spillovers and
synergies, benefiting not only the newly served corridors but
existing ones as well. For existing metro lines, newly opened
lines increase the number of regional origin-destination
combinations that can be served.
Note: a The term ‘equalizer’ is preferred to ‘disincentive’ as such policies are not
punitive, and aim to ‘level the playing field’ so as to remove any unfair advantages to
private car travel.

ties, though the magnitude of impacts varied considerably.165 When rail investments are carefully coordinated with land development through public–
private partnerships, as in Portland, Oregon, the
results can be dramatic and catalytic. Portland’s east
and west light rail lines attracted over US$2.4 billion
in investment within walking distance of their
stations.166 The city’s new streetcar line through the
mixed residential-commercial Pearl District triggered
US$2.3 billion in private investments. According to
estimates, every dollar in public investment in public
transport leveraged US$31 in private investments in
Portland.167

Land-value appreciation presents an opportunity
to recapture the value created by public investments
in public transport, as practiced in Hong Kong,
China (Box 8.7) and Tokyo, Japan (through private
railway consortia). Public transport value captures not
only add revenues to the public coffers, but also by
sharing the value-added from public investments, land
speculation is reduced. In Hong Kong, the ‘Rail+
Property’ approach also creates market demand that
ensures high-ridership services.168 Hong Kong’s
version of public–private partnership is not about
off-loading the cost of building railways to the
private sector. Rather, it is about ‘co-development’
– each sector bringing a natural advantage to the
table (e.g. land acquisition powers in the case of
the public sector; access to equity capital in the case
of the private sector). The resulting ‘win–win’ situation leads to financially viable investments and an
intimate connection between rail systems and nearby
real-estate development that attracts tenants, new
investors and public transport riders. Public-transport
joint developments (e.g. the leasing of air rights
above metro-rail stations to private developers) are
another way to financially capitalize on the accessibility benefits conferred by public rail investments.169

Conventional wisdom holds that traditional bus
services have imperceptible influences on urban
form and land-use patterns because, in contrast to
many rail systems, they fail to deliver appreciable
accessibility benefits. This is especially the case in
developed countries where high levels of private car
ownership mean conventional buses are considerably
slower than cars for the vast majority of trips. The
ability to alter bus service levels, change bus routing,
as well as the stigma attached to the low-income
status of bus patrons, most likely suppress the
land-development impacts of conventional bus
services. An exception, however, is BRT wherein
buses are provided with an exclusive, dedicated lane,
which significantly improves the quality of service.
BRT investments in Ottawa (Canada), Pittsburgh
(US), Brisbane (Australia) and Curitiba (Brazil)
generated land-use benefits that were as large as
those that would have been created by railway investments.170 Thus, it is not public transport ‘hardware’
– i.e. steel-wheel trains or rubber-tire buses – that
unleash land-use changes, but rather the quality
of service and more specifically, the comparative
travel-time savings of taking public transport vis-àvis the private car.
As with rail, where BRT investments have
triggered land intensification, property markets
have responded. Significant land price increases
have also been recorded near BRT stops in Bogotá
(Colombia), Seoul (Republic of Korea), Brisbane
(Australia) and Los Angeles (US).171 One study

revealed that multi-family housing units within fiveminutes walking distance of Bogotá’s TransMilenio
BRT, were rented for appreciably more per square
metre than those units located farther away.172
Pedestrian-friendly environments near TransMilenio
stops, further increased land-value benefits.173
Bogotá’s TransMilenio has also enjoyed network
effects: the addition of new TransMilenio lines
increased housing rents for currently served residences more than opening new lines to previously
unserved ones.174 Such land-value appreciations
create opportunities for value capture, just as with
urban rail systems. Bogotá practices value capture to
finance urban infrastructure under a programme
called Plusvalia, however implementation problems
– including high revenue collection costs and charges
of assessment biases and institutional corruption –
have undermined the programme.175 More successful
has been Ahmedabad’s programme of exacting
surcharges from landholders, for the right to increase
their building densities by up to 30 per cent, along
the 89-kilometre Janmarg BRT system in India. Some
of the funds received are channelled towards building
affordable housing, particularly for low-income
households displaced by BRT expansion. In addition,
the construction of parallel cycle tracks to the
Janmarg BRT is helping to create multi-modal
corridors and an ethos of ‘complete streets’ in the
minds of system designers and local citizens.176

Impacts of motorways
Motorways generally exert stronger influences on
urban form than public transport lines.177 Since
access is nearly ubiquitous with a car-based system,
activities tend to be dispersed and segregated. US
metropolises such as Los Angeles and Phoenix are
testaments to the sprawling effects of motorways.
Like a rail system, whatever clustering and agglomeration occurs tends to be around freeway interchanges – e.g. shopping malls and large stand-alone
retail outlets. Also, impacts are often context specific,
shaped by the permissiveness of land-use regulations and local real estate market demands. Other
impacts include the institutional capacity to supplement roadways with other supportive infrastructure to accommodate new growth, and the ability to
moderate potential neighbourhood opposition to
nearby infrastructure investments.
Worldwide, the impacts of new roads may vary
considerably. In poorer countries, road investments
generate new economic growth, opening access to
new markets and expanding trade-sheds. Developed
countries, by contrast, experience impacts that are
largely redistributive, hence shifting growth that
might otherwise occur in some settings to newly
served highway settings.178 This is mainly due to the
fact that accessibility levels are usually already so high
in developed settings that the economic impacts of
any new highway tend to be marginal.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
A paradigm shift is occurring in the relationship
between transportation systems, mobility and cities.
Public-policy turnarounds, like the removal of
elevated freeways, the building of high-rise downtown
towers interlaced by great pedestrian infrastructure and transit-oriented corridors, all recognize that
travel is a ‘derived demand’ – secondary to the
primary objective of connecting people and places.
As long as transportation is rightfully cast as a means
to an end, and not an end in and of itself, policies
can be put into place that enhance mobility while
avoiding (or at least reducing) negative externalities
and promoting community stability and cohesion.
Urban form is principally a product of the
dominant transportation system in place during
the period of a region’s prevailing growth. Cities that
grew rapidly when high-capacity public transport
systems were being built, such as Toronto (Canada)
and Curitiba (Brazil) have high-density and lineal built
forms. Those that sprouted at the time when freeways were being built – such as in Phoenix and
Houston (US) – have low-density, autocentric layouts.
As cities develop and prosper in developing countries, unprecedented opportunities will arise for
linking land development and transport infrastructure. While levels of motorization are stabilizing
in developed countries, they are increasing rapidly
elsewhere. Given the fact that a vast majority of
future urban growth is projected for cities with a
current population of less than 500,000 inhabitants,
a bus-based form of smaller scale TOD interlaced
by high-quality infrastructure for pedestrians and
cyclists may be appropriate in many urban settings.
Cities introducing railway and BRT solutions are
bound to trigger meaningful land-use changes,
including rapid growth and rising real incomes. This,
of course, assumes there is supportive planning and
zoning, public-sector leveraging and risk sharing, a
commitment to travel-demand management to
remove many built-in incentives to car use, and the
capacity to manage the land-use shifts that are put
into motion by transportation infrastructure
investments.
There are signs that cities in different parts of
the world are moving towards the development
of more compact forms. Numerous cities have unveiled development plans that emphasize urban
designs that shorten trips, create complete streets,
encourage mixed-use developments and make
cities more liveable.179 Globally, there is a growing
appreciation in various developing-country cities
that integrated transport and land-use planning is
critical toward future economic success, more equitable development and environmentally sustainable
solutions.

Global experiences reveal that a cogent regional
vision helps considerably in ensuring transportation investments produce desired urban-form outcomes. Visions need visionaries, such as Curitiba’s
Jaime Lerner, Bogotá’s Enrique Peñalosa and Seoul’s
Myong-Bak Lee. However, visions are malleable, and
are therefore subject to change as realities unfold.
Often, cities are path dependent in their spatial
evolutions, thus breaking away from established practices can be difficult and slow. Traditionally, highways were built to serve urban sprawl, which in turn
requires the construction of more highways. This
vicious cycle of road construction and urban growth
feeding off each other is often difficult to break.
Accordingly, sustained leadership in working toward
a common urban-form visionary becomes all the
more crucial.
While the importance of linking land use and city
form to transportation and mobility is increasingly
recognized, moving from rhetoric to reality is not
always easy. The list of true success stories is quite
short. Whereas the experiences of Curitiba (Brazil),
Portland (US), Singapore, Copenhagen (Denmark)
and Stockholm (Sweden) are well-chronicled, there
is a need for best-case practices that are directly
applicable and relevant to the unique problems of
cities in developing countries. Another notable gap
is the limited knowledge about the influences of
‘goods movements’ on urban development patterns
and vice versa. The siting of large warehouse distribution complexes on urban peripheries no doubt
contributes to sprawl. As noted in Chapter 4, the
spatial needs for goods handling and freight terminals,
warehousing, commercial markets and the array of
formal and informal delivery carriers are rarely given
due priority in urban planning. Opportunities exist
for improving urban logistics, such as the creation
of freight consolidation centres on the periphery that
allow a single truck to deliver goods to multiple
destinations. Compact, mixed-use development,
moreover, can promote efficient urban logistics by
allowing few-stop deliveries.
The integration of transportation, city form and
function and mobility strategies are not, in and of
themselves, a panacea to the multitude of problems
facing today’s major cities. Transportation and landuse integration, with the development of more sustainable densities in strategic locations, is but one
of a number of strategies that must be pursued if
substantial headway is to be made in shrinking the
transport sector’s ecological footprint. In addition to
the environmental dividends of improved transportation and land-use integration, there are other
reasons – such as social inclusion, economic growth
and municipal cost savings – for creating more
accessible, more liveable and less car-dependent
cities of the future. Such issues are discussed in the
next three chapters of this report.

NOTES
1 In this report, the term ‘urban
form’ is used broadly to express
the physical layout, design, space
and morphology of cities,
including buildings, roads and
streets. It represents the spatial
configuration of a city and, as
discussed throughout the
chapter, is both shaped by and
gives form to transportation
infrastructure and services.
The term ‘built environment’ is
often used to reflect the many
physical dimensions of a city and
its neighbourhoods that
influence travel. In this report,
terms such as urban form, land
use and built environment are
used interchangeably.

CHAPTER

6

EQUITABLE ACCESS TO
URBAN MOBILITY
Mobility is a social and economic need. The availability of transport options, and the way they are
delivered, can present major challenges to the
mobility of many residents in today’s cities. Investments in urban transport infrastructure do little to
alleviate the mobility difficulties of the urban poor
or other vulnerable and disadvantaged groups if the
services provided are unaffordable or physically
inaccessible. Such barriers contribute to socio-spatial
inequities in urban areas, including discrimination
against vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. These
barriers are not only fiscal or technical in nature, but
arise from political, social and institutional factors that
prevent progress towards socially sustainable urban
mobility systems. Thus, this chapter focuses on the
aspects of urban mobility that relate to providing
affordable access to opportunities, minimizing social
exclusion and improving the quality of life for all.
In recent years, transport policy has begun to
focus more intently on new assessment and evaluation regimes, to better articulate the impacts of
transport investments. Whereas transport projects
undergo environmental and economic impact assessments, the application of social impact assessments
is relatively less advanced.1 Integrating social dimensions throughout the lifecycle of transport projects
enhances their potential to bring life-changing
benefits to the end users, while reducing the risk of
negative social outcomes.2 The additional effort
invested in social analysis can bring disproportionate
returns: projects that are more appropriate, sustainable, safe and high quality, and that enhance community engagement and participation.
As city mobility systems become increasingly
motorized, travellers are vulnerable to traffic-related
conflicts and accidents, congestion, as well as the
costs of motorized transport, while penalizing those
who cannot afford a car. Without a good public
transportation system, travellers face a complex
trade-off between shelter security, travel distance and
travel mode.3 At the same time, non-motorized road
users (primarily pedestrians and cyclists) and public

transport users – particularly in developing countries
– are often overlooked in the design and modernization of transportation infrastructure.4
As noted in Chapter 1, the main purpose of
urban mobility systems is to provide access to
basic goods, services and activities – such as work,
education, medical care, shopping, socializing – and
to enable people to participate in civic life. The
Habitat Agenda explicitly calls for full accessibility to
work, goods and services – to affordable public transport – including for those belonging to vulnerable
and disadvantaged groups, stressing that priority
should be given to the needs of women and children
‘who often bear the greatest burden of poverty’.5 Yet,
in reality, people and communities do not have equal
access to urban opportunities. The unequal access
per se is not necessarily problematic, however, the
distribution of impacts (benefits, disadvantages and
costs) can be considered ‘unfair’, in which case this
becomes an issue of social equity. Considerations of
equity in urban mobility systems frequently analyse
disparities in access to urban opportunities, as well
as disparities in income and travel-related costs. In
light of these challenges, the satisfaction of the
mobility needs of all groups of society is a necessary
condition for supporting equal chances in life.6
Ultimately, restrictions in access to urban opportunities may imply an abuse of human rights, most
notably economic, social and cultural rights (such as
the rights to free choice of employment; the right
to public health, medical care, social security and
social services; the right to education and training;
and the right to equal participation in cultural
activities) and the right of access to any place or
service intended for use by the general public.
This daunting information raises the question:
what do we mean by socially sustainable urban
mobility? As there are competing perceptions and
applications of ‘social sustainability’,7 some cities opt
for a single, encompassing definition that denies
much of the concept’s complexity. Additionally,
translating the complex subjective, qualitative and

political dimensions of social sustainability into easyto-measure quantitative indicators is complicated (at
best).8 In order to produce meaningful results,
metrics must be tailored to reflect unique sociocultural characteristics of contexts and locations,
hindering the adoption of any one common measurement. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the
elements of social sustainability in any evaluation of
mobility modes, since these social implications affect
behavioural choices, which are ultimately responsible
for the success or failure of any urban mobility
system.
Meeting the mobility needs of burgeoning urban
populations in a socially inclusive (and equitable)
manner will not be an easy task. The most critical
challenge is the heterogeneity of urban populations
and the spatial dispersion of social and economic
activities. The best way to meet the mobility needs
of the poor and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups
is to provide adequate public transport and appropriate infrastructure for non-motorized modes of
travel. Furthermore, improved urban planning, new
technologies and infrastructure measures are needed.
Notably, emphasis should be placed on moving people
and goods, freely and safely, and facilitating equitable
access to services.
This chapter documents global trends, conditions
and challenges with respect to equitable access to
urban mobility. It highlights actual and potential
policy responses and practices that may address
social equity and enhance social sustainability in
urban mobility systems. The first section discusses
affordability as an important aspect of equitable
access. It notes that transport expenditures affect
low-income households disproportionately. The
second section discusses the access of disadvantaged groups to urban mobility systems. This provides
the necessary background to understand and accommodate the differential mobility needs of various
population segments. The third section explores
issues relating to safety and security in urban mobility
systems. It distinguishes between the problems of
transport safety (accidents and damages) and the
problems of transport security (privacy and freedom

from fear). The final section provides concluding
comments and lessons for policy.

AFFORDABLE URBAN
MOBILITY
In order for urban mobility systems to be socially
sustainable, urban public transport must be affordable to the majority of the urban population, and
in particular for those that have no other way of
travelling to access basic goods, services and activities.
This is a critical equity objective that can reduce
burdens and expand opportunities, particularly to
persons who are vulnerable and/or disadvantaged.
Based on the discussion in earlier chapters, this
section analyses challenges and impacts related to
equitable access and public transport affordability.
It also examines policy responses designed to
promote affordable transportation. It finishes by
presenting good practices and policies from around
the world, pointing the way towards successful
transformation of urban mobility culture.

Challenges and impacts of urban poverty
An understanding of the travel patterns of urban
public transport users is required to determine the
extent of their mobility challenges. The notion of
motility implies the balance between accessibility
(i.e. transportation opportunities: public transport and
other modes) and individual skills (i.e. how to use
the transportation on offer), with the user’s appropriation of the mobility system (i.e. their experiences,
habits, perceptions and values linked to travel mode
and space).9 As such, access is the most important
facet of motility, because it sets the scene for possible
mobility. Improved transport connections can help
in tackling social exclusion through addressing
barriers posed by the accessibility, availability,
acceptability, and affordability of the urban
mobility system (Box 6.1). In such cases, information
from and the participation of all stakeholders,
throughout the planning process, is needed in the
development of mobility systems.

Box 6.1 Understanding the parameters of urban transport
Affordability refers to the extent to which the financial cost
of journeys puts an individual or household in the position of
having to make sacrifices to travel, or to the extent to which
they can afford to travel when they want to.
Availability of transport is used to refer to route possibilities,
timings and frequency.
Accessibility describes the ease with which all categories of
passenger can use public transport. For example, buses with
high steps are difficult to board, particularly if they are one-

person operated and there is no assistance. Accessibility also
includes ease of finding out about travel possibilities, i.e. the
information function.
Acceptability is another important quality of public transport,
either because of the transport or the standards of the
traveller. For example, travellers may be deterred from using
public transport due to lack of personal security on buses and
trains.

International research into the relationships
between transport and poverty indicates that the
poor are increasingly concentrated on the periphery
of urban areas.10 As a result, they travel longer
distances than many better-off groups and their need
for affordable transport is increased. This implies that
where (transportation) inequities persist, these
exacerbate social exclusion and poverty, both at the
individual and at the society level. In this case,
poverty is viewed as the lack of financial resources
to meet basic individual or household needs, while
social exclusion refers to existing barriers that make
it difficult for people to participate fully in society.11
The choice of mobility mode is related to income
levels.12 For those with low incomes there are very
few affordable choices. As a result, in many developing countries, only a small proportion of trips are
undertaken using motorized vehicles.13 The prevalence of long walking trips indicates poor access and
lack of affordable mobility options. Therefore, it is
essential that pedestrians must be accounted for in
any public transport policy. In Tianjin, China, 80 per
cent of all commuter trips are by non-motorized
modes, mainly bicycles.14 Cycling offers an inexpensive means of improving accessibility for all. In some
European countries, the use of bicycles as a mode
of transport is steadily increasing, both as a main
mode and as a subsidiary or feeder mode.15 However,
in Africa and Latin America, it is often neglected in
terms of design and safety, due to negative social
representations, associating bicycle use with
poverty.16
In developing countries, car ownership remains
the privilege of a small (although rapidly growing)
minority. In some countries of Africa and parts of Asia,
vehicle ownership rates are as low as three motor
vehicles per 1000 population.17 Hence, financially
deprived households depend exclusively on public
transport (formal or informal) for motorized trips, and
are exposed to the risks of increasing transport costs.
In many developed countries, the dependency on
private motorized transport tends to increase per
capita transportation costs and reduce transportation affordability.18 As most road infrastructure is
subsidized, there is no incentive for car owners to
shift to cleaner travel options, as it costs so much
less to drive. Yet, urban sprawl and car-dependent
urban growth continue worldwide, and can compromise the levels of accessibility among vulnerable
and disadvantaged groups, such as the elderly and
children.19
Socioeconomic differences in travel patterns in
many developed countries (such as the UK and the
US) indicate that the poor and ethnic and other
minorities are less likely to have cars and are more
likely to travel by public transport. From Delhi to
Shanghai and Brussels to New York, the provision of
economical and convenient ‘last-mile connectivity’ –
i.e. from the trip ends to the point of accessing public

transport systems – remains a major issue of
concern.20 Poor walking and cycling environments
further accentuate the problem for public transport
users, particularly the disabled and elderly. In larger
cities, the trend is towards fixed-route bus services,
which often implies that journeys become more
complex, often involving interchanges and lengthy
waiting and walking times. Evidence suggests that
public transport deficiencies in urban areas have a
greater impact on the poor than on other groups.21
However, the fares charged by private informal
operators are often higher than publicly operated
ones, particularly if one takes into account the lack
of fare integration between routes. While a passenger of a public transport service may often pay a flat
rate for a trip that involves several individual legs,
such fare integration is rare among informal transport providers. Consequently, the poor are forced to
carefully prioritize their mobility needs and
expenditure.
For many urban dwellers, the cost of mobility
is very high in relation to their household incomes.
In cities of developing countries, between 8 and 16
per cent of household income is spent on transport.
Among the poorest households in large cities, this
rises to more than 25 per cent.22 Thus, the level and
quality of transport services are often lower for those
in low-income areas, where commuters are heavily
dependent on public transport for their mobility
needs. People have little option but to endure a
deteriorating service. The disproportionate financial
burden felt by the poor in reaching job opportunities
is not limited to developing countries. Data from the
US suggest that low-income earners spend nearly
twice as much of their income reaching their place
of employment compared to the non-poor (6.1 per
cent versus 3.8 per cent).23
Constrained mobility is an important element of
the social exclusion that defines urban poverty.24 As
outlined above: without effective transport systems,
poor households are unable to access basic goods,
services and activities. It is important also to consider
the flow of social capital in the form of information,
news or job opportunities facilitated through transport networks.25 Table 6.1 illustrates how improved
mobility has a significant impact on the four major
dimensions of poverty.
As indicated in Table 6.1 there are several
important links between transport infrastructure
and services and different dimensions of poverty.
Poor people’s lack of assets and technologies means
that production – for the market as well as for
the household – is time and energy intensive. The
greatest proportion of the lowest productivity, most
time-consuming work is done by women.26 By
focusing more investment in the infrastructure and
services used by (and appropriate to) women, their
‘time poverty’ can be drastically reduced.

Other direct impacts on poverty that the transport sector can help achieve include employment
generation – in transport infrastructure projects, as
well as in the transport service industry. Delivery of
infrastructure can be done in ways that optimize the
use of local labour and resources. Similarly, local
transport services have a potential for providing
employment to operators and providers of other
support services. However, improved infrastructure
planning and service provisions are resources that,
in combination, either enhance or disadvantage the
livelihood of urban dwellers.27
A key example is eviction and resettlement
resulting directly from urban transport infrastructure
projects. As illustrated in Box 6.2, these projects often
disrupt lives and livelihoods, and may form physical
barriers that cause community severance. Streets that
were once a place where people stopped for
conversation and children played are transformed into
the exclusive domain of cars. Furthermore, the
quality of the local environment is vastly reduced with
noise and air pollution.28 Moreover, without secure
tenure the poorest groups risk being displaced
through gentrification. The narrow focus on solving
congestion tends to mostly benefit high-income

private vehicle users. More thoughtful and holistic
solutions are thus needed to bring benefits to a
wider population.
Detailed and systematic consideration of social
issues in urban mobility appraisals maximizes the
opportunities for positive outcomes and reduces or
mitigates the risks and negative impacts of transport
infrastructure projects. Unfortunately, the urban
poor are often marginalized in transport planning and
project evaluations. However, the establishment of
good relationships with stakeholders and a focus on
their concerns have the potential to generate
significant positive opportunities for the project and
the organizations involved.
In summary, the access and mobility of the
urban poor is constrained by: city planning,
socioeconomic characteristics, transport facilities and the availability of services. The next
section outlines some general ways in which policy
can be refocused to give particular assistance to the
poorest groups, through concentration on the
needs of specific social groups, or indirectly through
assistance to those modes of transport on which
the urban poor are known to be particularly
dependent.

Box 6.2 Nairobi–Thika highway improvement project, Kenya
The Nairobi–Thika highway is one of the three major
corridors linking downtown Nairobi to the suburbs and
satellite towns. Jointly financed by the African Development
Bank, and the Chinese government, the project aims to
contribute to and improve the accessibility, affordability and
reliability of the transport infrastructure, as well as reduce
traffic congestion. The expanded Thika Road, which was
completed in July 2012, has drawn mixed reactions from
residents living along the highway, who are particularly
concerned about the socioeconomic impact the new road will
have on their lives.
The construction of the highway disrupted neighbourhoods by relocating urban residents to the periphery and
increasing their travel distances and expenditures. Severance
of communities by traffic and the highway is a particular
problem for people without access to a car, some older

people, people with disabilities and school children, because
they often rely on walking. The project’s focus on fast and
free-flowing traffic has resulted in the need to construct
pedestrian overpasses and barriers, which often leads to
community severance and inconvenience for the local
population.
The skyrocketing property values along the new road
have been reported to threaten food security in an area whose
residents rely on subsistence farming for sustenance, as
farmland is bought up for new development. Furthermore, due
to the increased cost of living, many tenants in the area have
been forced to move out, as they could no longer afford the
rents. Moreover, inadequate or unaffordable transport has led
to excessive building and population densities, causing
deterioration of the living environment.

Policy responses and innovative practices
This section highlights some ambitious policy responses that have been introduced in recent years to
address the challenges outlined above. Achieving
transport affordability objectives requires actions
that support non-motorized transport; reduce the
financial costs of transport services; and increase
transportation affordability through improved landuse accessibility.
n

Supporting non-motorized transport

Transport policy measures can reduce levels of car
use by supporting walking and cycling.29 These modes
are relatively low cost, and they are important for
short trips, which make up the largest share of trips
in urban areas.30 Non-motorized transport can be
stimulated by a policy package consisting of investments in facilities, improved transportation networks,
awareness campaigns, as well as disincentives for
the use of private motorized vehicles. Many cities in
developed countries recognize the need to plan
walkable environments and street network designs
that promote neighbourly interactions, and through
this, the development of social capital.31
Some significant transport interventions offer
interesting lessons. Amsterdam (the Netherlands)
and Copenhagen (Denmark) have high levels of
bicycle use and very low death rates from road traffic
accidents.32 The high modal shares were made
possible through decades of investment in nonmotorized transport infrastructure. This includes
wide-scale improvements to pedestrian and bicycle
facilities; development of facilities for intermodal
connectivity; and adoption of complete pedestrian
and bicycle design standards, wherever feasible.
Many other cities have moved away from car-centric
urban models and embraced full pedestrianization of
downtown commercial areas such as observed in
Shanghai (China) and Curitiba (Brazil).33 This has
provided economic savings and benefits, reflected in
increased land values. 34
Combining public transport and cycling can
provide a high level of affordable mobility. A case in
point is vélib, a free public bicycle rental scheme
in Paris, France.35 Hangzhou (China)36 and Mexico

City have also established bicycle hire schemes to
encourage cycling at a minimum cost to taxpayers
and users of the scheme. Such policies are increasingly linked with investments in BRT systems, for
instance in Delhi (India), Guangzhou (China), Jakarta
(Indonesia) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), placing
non-motorized transport infrastructure as important
feeder networks for BRT ridership.37 Box 6.3 highlights recent developments in Africa that encourage
increasing investments in non-motorized transport
infrastructure.
The need to consider bicycle designs that will
accommodate both environmental requirements
and commuters’ needs is essential.38 Recently, the
Institute for Transportation and Development Policy
(ITDP) succeeded in the commercial adoption of an
improved Indian cycle rickshaw. Reduced weight
and greater comfort have allowed rickshaw operators to increase their wages by 20–50 per cent.39
However, whereas they are important for the survival
of numerous owner-drivers, rickshaws had been
banned from major roads in Dhaka as a way to reduce
road congestion. Such policies can have adverse
impacts on vulnerable and disadvantaged persons,
such as loss of employment and reduced mobility
levels.40 Uganda, meanwhile, was home to about
200,000 boda bodas (bicycle-taxis) in 2000, 41 which
provide employment for large numbers of previously
unemployed youth. Subsequently, there has been a
widespread increase in the use of motorcycle taxis
within both Uganda and Kenya.42
Training is an important strategic instrument
not only for disseminating new knowledge but also
for capacity building and increasing the awareness
of the needs of non-motorized transport users. The
private sector could be a key partner in supply-side
interventions to increase bicycle ownership and use
through the promotion of micro-credit programmes
and providing cycling education. In the 1990s,
women in Pudukkottai, India, were provided with
loans to purchase bicycles and given cycling lessons,
so that they could access a literacy programme.
Additionally, the programme provided employment
opportunities for the women, who were trained as
bicycle mechanics. Five years later, it is now socially
acceptable for women to ride a bicycle, and bicycles

Box 6.3 Supporting non-motorized transport investments in Africa
In 2008–2009, African government ministers participated in
workshops that developed framework agreements that
recognized the importance of transport infrastructure and
urban planning. The need to raise investments in nonmotorized transport infrastructure is identified as a key
component to an integrated approach in transport for Africa.
The agreed article in the ‘Eastern Africa Regional
Framework Agreement on Air Pollution’, endorsed the idea

of a 10 per cent investment policy as follows: ‘Encourage the
use of non-motorized transport systems that have many
advantages and are used by an overwhelming majority, but are
constantly overlooked. At a minimum 10% of infrastructure
costs should be dedicated to this majority and the focus
should be on safety. Particular emphasis should be given to
high-demand, mixed-use roads in urban and peri-urban areas’.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 6.4 Integrating non-motorized transport into transportation systems in Bogotá, Colombia
During the administration of Mayor Enrique Peñalosa, Bogotá’s
visionary goal was centred on liveability, social equity and
reclamation of public space. To achieve this, the administration
established policies in seven areas: institutional strengthening,
restraining private car use, public space, public transport, nonmotorized transport, road maintenance and traffic
management.
Large investment in infrastructure for non-motorized
and public transport was justified by its impact on equality.
Inclusive investments for all, such as bicycle lanes, pedestrian
highways and the BRT system, demonstrated a commitment to
public good over private ownership. Likewise, actions such as
the removal of cars from sidewalks, car-free Sundays and
establishing a highway solely for Transmileno, exhibited

are being used for going to school, fetching water
and going to hospital during an emergency. The
example of Bogotá, Colombia, shows that strong
non-motorized transport policies, awareness campaigns and political commitment can bring about a
shift in public attitudes towards non-motorized
transport, as well as enhanced social inclusion (Box
6.4).43 However, there is still a lot to be done, and
the Transmileno system still needs to be further
developed to fulfil its promises. One of the major
critiques is the lack of coverage, as many groups of
people are excluded from the current 84-kilometre
system simply because it is not yet operating in their
neighborhoods. Thus, many of Bogotá’s residents are
still relying on the traditional bus system, which is,
in effect, operating in competition with Transmileno.44
Most cities in developing countries are high
density and therefore suitable for policies promoting
non-motorized transport. Travel-demand management has a key role to play in this context. Such urban
policies affect the demand for travel through the
pricing and regulation of different modes of transport.
An important benefit of travel-demand management strategies, besides improving the quality of
low-cost transportation modes, has been increasing public transport affordability for low-income
groups.45 In the UK, there has been a change from
road building towards the introduction of demandmanagement initiatives. Progressively, London has
experienced a modal shift, in part due to its congestion charging scheme, making it possible to
convert traffic lanes to bicycle lanes.46 The adoption
of automated bus lane enforcement has dramatically
improved the speed and reliability of bus services.
Generally, consumers are able to save money if they
use alternative modes, routes or travel times to avoid
driving on congested roads.47

consideration to those on low incomes who do not benefit
from investment in motorized transport infrastructure. The
theme of equality was a key driver in the development of a
357-kilometre long bicycle network (known as cicloruttas). The
bicycle network was deliberately designed to run through lowincome and wealthy areas in order to promote integration and
a sense that all citizens had an equal stake in city-wide development. These developments acted as ‘social equalizers’,
providing the poor with better transport links and free leisure
facilities. People supported the measures once they saw
results, and Peñalosa left office with a record approval rating.
Decisive leadership, political will and strong institutions were
the critical factors contributing to success.

Improving affordability and quality of service
of public transport
Public transport fares should be set at rates that allow
commuters to use it. In developing countries, fares
are often set above competitive equilibrium levels.48
This promotes excessive entry of buses, and is further
exacerbated by the capture of the regulator. Since
buses are not perfect substitutes, price competition
is not an effective mechanism for regulating the
optimal quantity of buses in the market. To minimize
waiting time, most riders prefer to use the first bus
that arrives, even though a cheaper bus may come
along in a few minutes. Time, not fares, seems to be
the most important variable for the rider. This
simplifies the bus operator’s market power to raise
fares.49
Notably, consideration should be made to ensure
that the fare (plus subsidies) covers the cost of
operation, and at the same time remains affordable
to the public. This is particularly important, as setting
fares artificially low – without compensating service
providers – can undermine the viability of a transport system. For instance, the bus fare needed to
cover the operating costs in Lomé (Togo) was 295
CFA Francs. Yet, the fares charged were 250 CFA
Francs, which was later reduced to 200 CFA Francs
(by the government), thereby resulting in an operating deficit of 22 million.50 Thus, a delicate balance
must be struck between the consumer’s convenience
and willingness to pay, and the operator’s need to
balance its budgets (or to make a profit, in the case
of private-sector operators).51
The promotion of affordable transportation
requires a robust framework that defines and measures transportation affordability appropriately.
Conventional planning tends to consider a relatively
limited range of transport affordability impacts and
objectives. To address this limitation, the World
Bank has developed an affordability index to address
the need for easily available and comprehensive,

comparative information on affordability of public
transport fares across the globe (Table 6.2). The index
values may be defined as the fare expenditure (for a
total of 60 10-kilometre trips per month) as a
percentage of income. It can be computed for various
income groups and the results may be used to
determine whether the proportion of income spent
on fares is reasonable, high or onerous.
The data in Table 6.2 show huge variances
between cities, due to their different contexts. The
low-income residents of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and
Brasília (Brazil) are all faced with unbearable
situations, as transport expenses would account for
more than half of their incomes. Cities such as
Bangkok and Cairo, by contrast, have low fares, due
to the low public transport fares (Bangkok) and the
absence of extreme poverty in the lower quintile
(Cairo).52 Despite this improvement, the index is
limited by the simplified nature of the indicators
employed, as well as the questionable quality of

available statistics. As such, there is need for a more
precise analysis.
Transport subsidy is an important policy option
for ensuring equitable transport access for the poor
and other road users. However, such subsidies are
blunt instruments and require careful design to be
both socially and economically justified. Poorly
targeted subsidies may result in the rich deriving a
disproportionate benefit compared to the poor. A
more efficient approach is a strategy involving
appropriately targeted subsidies by route or through
employer-based schemes.53 In Brazilian cities, since
1987 employers must, by law, subsidize the transport costs of their employees (if these costs exceed
6 per cent of their salaries) under the Vale-Transporte
(‘transportation vouchers’) system. This system
implies that the employer buys public transport
vouchers or tops up the electronic transport passes
of their employees directly (i.e. without involving the
government). Employers can, as an alternative,

provide staff transport.54 However, the system applies
only to the employees of the formal sector, meaning
that more than 50 per cent of the urban workforce
(including the major part of the poor and low-income
population) is excluded from the scheme.55
The reform of the urban public transport sector
in Kazakhstan is an illustration of a project resulting
in poverty alleviation for the poor. Prior to reform,
the public transport system was characterized by
inadequate services, as well as crowded and lengthy
waiting times. A transport intervention was initiated
to deregulate and liberalize the provision of transport services, as well as improve the quality of the
service.56 Consequently, transportation affordability
for transport users improved due to the reduction in
fares.
Many cities (and regions) are modernizing their
fare payment technologies, and integrating fare
systems between different public transport routes,
modes and even operators, for users’ convenience.
Experience with the ‘Oyster’ smartcard ticketing
scheme in London, UK, has resulted in increased bus
patronage, due to the simplified fare system and ease
of interchange. This has also empowered commuters
with information on the range of fully integrated
fare products and improved service coordination.57
Another positive development can be observed in
Seoul, Republic of Korea, where the implementation of ‘smart cards’ allows commuters to transfer
from one mode to another at a discounted rate.58
A receptive institutional environment helps to
create integrated and unified tariff systems, resulting
in cost-effectiveness in ticketing. An exemplary
model is Germany’s transport federations (verkehrsverbund).59

Improving affordability through urban form
and land use
The affordability of urban mobility can be increased
by improving land-use accessibility, and addressing
the physical separation of activities and the means
by which distance can be reduced. The intention
is to build sustainable mobility into the patterns of
urban form and layouts, and make public transport,
pedestrian and bicycle use practical and affordable.
Accessibility planning60 offers a new way to ensure
that urban residents can reach the services and
facilities they need by walking, cycling and public
transport. Box 6.5 presents institutional arrangements created in Atlanta, US, that allow for the
coordination of land-use and transport infrastructure
investments, which could improve affordability and
accessibility, particularly for ethnic minorities.
The integration of land use and travel-demand
management measures can substantially enhance
accessibility and lead to improved public transport
affordability. Curitiba, Brazil, is a case in point, with
40 years of carefully integrating urbanization and
transportation improvements.61 By replacing cars
with people, Curitiba has evolved along five welldefined linear corridors that protect the city centre.
Zoning laws encourage high-density commercial
development along these transport corridors, thus
reducing the amount of travel needed to access basic
goods, services and activities. Minibuses are used to
quickly and efficiently transport individuals from
residential neighbourhoods to express bus lines.
Compared with other Brazilian cities of its size,
Curitiba uses 30 percent less petrol per capita, and
affordable fares make it possible for the average lowincome family to spend around 10 per cent of its
n

Box 6.5 Metropolitan regional transport plans and priorities, Atlanta, US
The State of Georgia and the Atlanta metropolitan region have
experienced constant growth since the 1990s. Suburban areas
continue to expand, resulting in large-scale needs for transport
infrastructure projects. However, this urban sprawl
encourages disinvestment in housing and infrastructure
decline, placing a strain on the provision of public transport
services, particularly in older inner-city areas where African
Americans and other minorities are concentrated.
Recognizing the spatial distribution (and economic and
environmental impact) of highway spending, there is a growing
need for Atlanta’s metropolitan region to connect its evolving
plans for infrastructure investment with the realities of landuse patterns. The regional transport plan for 2000–2025 helps
guide the prioritization and funding of transportation
investments. It has been hailed as ‘an excellent example to
illustrate how the metropolitan growth can be managed by
proper land use-transportation planning and policy-making
without compromising sustainability’.a However, Atlanta’s

regional transportation policies have actually exacerbated
sprawl-related problems, with unintended consequences that
are not evenly distributed. The transport strategies were
designed to serve commuters from distant (more affluent)
suburbs, with no provision for reverse commute that might
help lower-income (primarily African American) communities
reach suburban employment opportunities (for example as
domestic workers, gardeners, etc., in the more affluent
suburban households).
This resulted in a lawsuit and subsequent
reconsideration of objectives. US$300 million state funds
allocated to the proposed sprawl-inducing road programme
was redirected to public transport, footpaths, bicycle paths
and road safety and maintenance projects. It also led the
federal government to scrutinize the distribution of
transportation benefits and burdens among ethnic groups in
the Atlanta metropolitan region.

income on transportation, which is relatively low in
Brazil.62
Public support for suitable low-cost housing
near large employment centres, or for public transport is a fundamental aspect of land-use planning.
Singapore has successfully created self-sufficient
new towns (in terms of jobs) and is systematically
addressing the housing needs of the poor.63 The
regional centres are planned as commercial centres
surrounded by high-density housing, integrated with
an efficient public transport system. Improving the
variety of services within the neighbourhood can be
an effective way of reducing the transport expenditure of low-income households. However, the Singapore experience may not be readily applicable to cities
suffering urban sprawl, with low-density suburbs.
Linking urban mobility systems and housing
policy makes good financial sense. Together, transportation and housing often make up a good half or
more of household consumption expenditures. To the
degree less is spent on transport, more income is
freed up for housing consumption. This is partly
the philosophy of Europe’s successful car-sharing
schemes. Location-efficient mortgage policies in the
US encourage residents to live in high-density, highaccessibility areas that reduce their need for cars.64
They allow a household to commit what it saves from
not owning a car to buy a more expensive home in
an area marked by location efficiency.65

VULNERABLE AND
DISADVANTAGED GROUPS
AND URBAN MOBILITY
Vulnerable and disadvantaged groups – women,
ethnic minorities, elderly, disabled people, youth,
children, etc. – stand to gain important social benefits
from improved urban mobility networks, technologies
and facilities, as improved access and mobility reduce
isolation, vulnerability and dependency. However,
mobility networks will need to cater to the specific
needs of such groups if they are to access the
benefits.66 Even in well-functioning public transport
systems, some passengers may be unable to afford
the services offered. Furthermore, it may also be
difficult for some to travel alone due to poor security,
or the public transport service may be physically
inaccessible for many elderly and disabled persons.
Vulnerable and disadvantaged groups are often
overrepresented as pedestrians, and their special
needs as pedestrians should be considered. For
example, elderly and disabled persons often face
challenges in crossing roads or navigating congested
pavements.
This section outlines the determinants of the
travel behaviour of vulnerable and disadvantaged
groups. It identifies global conditions, trends,

115

challenges and impacts faced by these segments of
the urban population. It also considers the extent to
which urban mobility policies address or conflict with
the different activity needs of such passenger groups.

Global conditions, trends and challenges
Worldwide, societies are gendered, in that men and
women often play different roles. In developed
countries, women’s commuting patterns are often
different from men’s, particularly if they are married
with children. They are also most likely to ‘trip-chain’,
implying that when travelling, they have multiple
purposes and destinations within one trip.67 This is
partly due to time constraints, and the fact that they
normally have less access to both private and public
transport. The situation is further compounded by
age. On average, women are more likely to be
working in part-time and lower-wage jobs than men,
contributing further to women’s increased expenditure in terms of time spent travelling. In the EU for
example, 31.9 per cent of employed women were
working part-time in 2010, compared to only 8.7 per
cent of men.68 Furthermore, available evidence
suggests that across the globe, the percentage of
women working in transport-related employment is
low; with those employed in the transport sector
earning 20 per cent less than men.69
While presenting similar gender differences,
women’s travel patterns in developing countries are
affected by their multiple roles as income earners,
childcare providers, household managers and maintainers of community networks.70 Whether in urban
or peri-urban areas, women tend to make more trips,
although over shorter distances, than men. Table 6.3
provides an overview of women’s urban travel
patterns and constraints in developing countries.
High costs of public transport can make such
services particularly prohibitive for women when it
comes to reaching places of work, education or basic
services. A study in Kampala, Uganda, revealed that
women spend approximately 29 per cent of their
income on public transport.71 As a result, women
appear to work closer to home than men.72 Also,
women tend to walk, and they rely on public transport primarily for longer distances.
Significant levels of sexual harassment of women
on urban public transport systems are frequently
reported from numerous cities. For example, a Tokyo
Metropolitan government survey of women who
travel during rush hour in Tokyo, revealed that twothirds of the women in the 20–30 age group said
they had been groped on crowded trains.73 In many
cities with Islamic populations, the situation is further
exacerbated by the social institution of pardah, which
prohibits the mixing of men and women in public.74
In Dhaka, Bangladesh, women’s exclusion from public
transport results from overcrowded buses, public
sexual harassment (referred to as ‘Eve teasing’) and

The major cause
of drop-outs in

developing
countries is the

inadequate sidewalks that hinder their access to the
workplace.75 Markedly, women will change their
transport behaviour and have their transport options
constrained if they perceive urban transport to be
unsafe.76
Furthermore, evidence suggests that the planning, provision and operation of public transport
in particular – and urban mobility in general – is
primarily undertaken by men. Given that ‘women’s
travel patterns are different from men’s, and these
differences are characterized by deep and persistent
inequalities . . . [whereby they] have inferior access
to both private and public means of transport’77
there is a strong case for mainstreaming gender
concerns in the working ethos of urban transport
organizations.78
The mobility needs of children and youth (Box
6.6) are primarily related to their need to access
educational facilities and childcare and related
services. Due to their age, the majority of youth under
the age of 18 in developed and developing countries
alike are unable to drive.79 Thus, someone has to

provide them with transportation, when distance and
other factors become barriers. In most countries, the
greatest burden of this passenger-serving trip-making
falls on women.80
Across the globe, evidence suggests that
children’s travel needs have a significant impact on
household travel patterns, due to the largely cardependent nature of those needs. This partly reflects
the parents’ perceptions of traffic danger, which are
supported by statistics on accident rates involving
children, particularly when they are walking or
cycling. In South Africa, more than 26 child deaths
per 100,000 population occur as a result of road
traffic crashes, compared to 1.7 per 100,000 in the
EU. In Bangladesh one in every four road deaths and
one in six serious injuries experienced by the poor
involves a child.81
With respect to education, the major cause of
drop-outs in primary schools in developing countries
is the distance that children have to walk to reach
their schools. Studies in Nepal show that for every
kilometre a child walks to school, the likelihood of
school attendance drops by 2.5 per cent.82 This
figure rises for girls and children with disabilities.
Fatigue, exhaustion and risk of dangers, such as
sexual assault, are some of the contributory factors
to non-attendance or irregular attendance.83
Public and informal motorized transport provides
greater mobility and a means of independent travel
for youth. Whereas a majority of developed countries
have dedicated school bus services in prominent
schools, the poorest are often dependent on public
and informal transport. In the context of developing
countries, typical problems of informal transport
parallel those of public transport related to

Box 6.6 Children and youth: Population trends
As indicated in Figure 6.1, children and youth contribute a
steadily diminishing proportion of populations world-wide.
While 34.3 per cent of the global population were under the
age of 15 in 1950, this figure has decreased to 26.2 per cent in
2013, and is projected to decline further to 20.5 per cent by
2050. It should be noted, however, that at the same time, the
total population of children and youth under the age of 15 has
more than doubled, from 869 million in 1950 to 1866 million

in 2013. Projections indicate that the population below the age
of 15 will stabilize at about 1.9 billion by the year 2050.
A similar trend can be seen for the 15–19 age group,
where the global population has nearly tripled from 239
million in 1950 (9.4 per cent of world total) to 601 million in
2013 (8.4 per cent of world total), and is expected to grow
slowly to 628 million by 2050 (6.7 per cent of world total).

unregulated fares. In Dar es Salaam (Tanzania),
Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Faisalabad (Pakistan), transport operators will not ferry school children and
pensioners on concessionary fares, and/or they break
their journey arbitrarily to ensure a double payment.84
It has been estimated that there are more than
1 billion people in the world with some form of
disability (i.e. 15.3 per cent of the global population). Among these, ‘nearly 200 million experience
considerable difficulties in functioning’85 (i.e. 2.9 per
cent of the population). As can be seen from Table
6.4, the prevalence of disability is generally higher
in developing countries than in developed countries
and highest among older persons. More than half of
the population aged 60 years or older in many developing countries are suffering from moderate or severe
disabilities, compared to about a third in developed
countries.
People with disabilities often find transport to
be limited, unaffordable or inaccessible, and frequently cite lack of adequate transport as a barrier
to accessing healthcare.86 In the years ahead, disability will become an even greater concern. This
is due to ageing populations and the higher risk of
disability in older people, as well as the global
increase in chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental
health disorders. Since 1950, the proportion of older
persons (i.e. those aged 60 or more) has been rising
steadily, from 8.1 per cent in 1950 to 11.7 per cent
in 2013, and is expected to reach 21.8 per cent in

2050 (Figure 6.2). By 2050, it is estimated that 3.2
million people will be over 100 years old; of which
1.3 million will live in developing countries.87
Whereas mobility is important for daily living, many
people who have got used to driving their own cars
will have to stop driving due to age-related disabilities.
The challenges faced by these people vary
considerably, due to the different types of disabilities
and their impact on mobility. For example, hearingimpaired and vision-impaired persons in wheelchairs
face different obstacles and thus need a variety of
assistance methods.88 Their movement is impaired
by steps, stairways, etc., which require redesign of
floor space requirements and facilities.89 Furthermore, where there is no pedestrian infrastructure –
such as signage or zebra crossings – they may need
to travel with an escort, or use special guidance equipment. Older persons and persons with disabilities

would thus benefit from design modifications such
as better information systems and low-floor vehicles.90
Privately run services such as shared taxis and minibuses are preferred by older and disabled persons
due to their demand for door-to-door services.
Nevertheless, most of these vehicles are not able to
accommodate the users of wheelchairs and can be
prohibitively costly. The alternative of hiring private
transport is often out of the price range of disabled
people, and parking spaces exclusively for their use
in the central city are limited.
While many countries have legislative frameworks requiring these challenges be addressed,
effective responses are limited. African countries in
particular suffer from insufficient monitoring, implementation and realization of such legislation.91 The
adoption of the United Nations’ Standard Rules on
the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with
Disabilities in 199492 and the Convention on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 200693 signalled
broad international consensus on how disability
issues should be addressed. National regulations are
also in place on a country-by-country basis.
It should also be noted that many persons suffer
from several different types of vulnerability and/or
disadvantage. Women with disabilities for example
often suffer compounded discrimination on the
grounds of gender and available income in addition
to the impairment.

Policy responses and innovative practices
There is a wide range of policy options and initiatives
in place in some cities that have worked to improve
mobility for the urban poor and enhance urban
access for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.
Some of the policies and programmes described here
do not require expenditure. Others could result in
savings or payback from spin-off effects through
more cost-effective management. Cities at various
levels of development can draw on the experiences

of other cities for further development or for improving existing conditions. The actual design of the
policy or practice will have to be modified for the
specific circumstances of each individual city.
In recent years, there have been significant
developments in the methodologies associated with
gender planning in respect of accessibility, mobility
and transport organization. Evidence shows that
many countries have integrated gender into their
transport programmes and projects.94 Opportunities
need to be provided for women to gain meaningful
and beneficial employment in the transport sector.
Hiring female bus operators was a key component
of the Trans Jakarta BRT initiative in Indonesia,
which provided Indonesian women with a first
opportunity of formal, regularized employment in the
sector.95 Experience shows that increased female
recruitment helps advance gender equality in society
in general, and also increases women’s level of
comfort and security in negotiating transport
situations.96
Such a focus on gender issues is justified by the
fact that it enhances the effectiveness of actions in
the transport sector, and therefore impacts on poverty
reduction. Data on user needs and access constraints
should be gender disaggregated and collected through
routine transport project monitoring and evaluation processes.97 A recent World Bank pilot study in
Lesotho that promotes the use of cognitive mapping exercises and geographic information system
(GIS) for gender-sensitive transport planning is a good
example of one such programme to map targeted
stakeholder use patterns for integration with planning.98 The participation of women transport users
is critical for the establishment of equitable practice
and the development of gender-sensitive understanding of transport needs and systems (Box 6.7).
Establishing a sustainable urban transport system
requires a comprehensive and integrated approach
to policy-making, with the aim of delivering peopleoriented, affordable and environmentally friendly

Box 6.7 Women’s participation in the transport sector in China
As part of an urban transport project in Liaoning Province,
China, women were integrated into the various phases of the
project, with the specific aim of increasing their participation.
The project specification was established through community
participation with separate focus groups for both men and
women. This made it possible to identify the number of
journeys made on a daily basis, which prompted priority to be
given to the issue of pavements, road drainage, hard shoulders
and their separation from the carriageway used by motor
vehicles, lighting and signing.
By providing a specific forum for women, planners
learned about specific concerns, opportunities and needs

voiced by a key stakeholder in the project that may not have
been raised in mix-gendered discussions. Women expressed
concerns about the lack of security encountered in using
buses: dark alleys, lengthy waiting times and vulnerability to
traffic accident and injury. The outcome led to changes being
made to the initial project in order to hasten improvements to
secondary roads and traffic management. Precedence was
given to the creation of pathways and pedestrian crossings,
the installation of public lighting and improved frequency of
bus services.

mobility systems. The following sections give practical
examples of policy responses that seek to deliver
transportation that is gender sensitive, efficient, safe
and responsive to the mobility needs of vulnerable
and disadvantaged groups.

Gender-sensitive design, infrastructure and
services
Public transportation planning must be based on a
recognition of the distinct needs of women’s distinct
roles, needs and experiences. As such, gender mainstreaming is essential. In Bangladesh, an Asian Development Bank project aims to improve infrastructure
facilities and the design of transport vehicles.99 The
project takes account of women’s specific needs
(public toilets, separate market stalls, lower steps in
buses, etc.). It also reserves 15 per cent of the small
businesses located along the roads under construction
for women.100 The small modifications made to the
existing infrastructure balance women’s needs for
privacy with their need for social inclusion. Furthermore, it begins the process of further integrating
women into social and economic domains that are
traditionally segregated by sex, and often dominated
by men.
Other policy initiatives focus on safeguarding
women’s safety and comfort in urban transport.
Passenger rail cars reserved for ‘women only’ have
been implemented in Japan, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico,
India, Belarus and the Philippines. Similarly, womenonly taxis are found in countries with large Islamic
populations, such as Lebanon, Syria and the United
Arab Emirates.101 Most of these cabs are clearly
marked in pink and feature women drivers. Whereas
such sex-segregated initiatives are often debated, they
have undoubtedly improved conditions for female
passengers.102
In France, rolling stock manufacturers pledge to
follow a charter proposed by an association called
Femmes en mouvement, les transports au féminin,
which requires the association to be present during
n

the design of new vehicles.103 Consultations are
carried out in relation to safety, accessibility, internal
configuration and respect for the environment.
This helps to improve the gender sensitive design of
public transport vehicles to accommodate women
with children and/or shopping bags such as womenonly carriages, child seating, storage spaces for prams
and shopping.
In many developing countries, means of transport such as carts, bicycles and animals are considered
a cost-effective manner to assist in meeting women’s
mobility needs.104 Bicycles have often been recommended as a means of increasing the overall mobility
of women, to enhance their socioeconomic and political participation. A study in India shows women’s
preference for the door-to-door demand service
provided by auto-rickshaws.105 The construction of
segregated lanes for auto-rickshaws can reduce time
burdens and benefit disadvantaged groups.
New mobility services – such as carpooling
schemes reserved for women – are beginning to
thrive throughout North America and Europe.106
Such programmes provide the convenience of inexpensive access.107 Families, commuters and employers are able to share cars at different times of
the day, with subsidized or preferential parking. In
Germany, well-lit parking sections have been set aside
for women near stairs and elevators in multi-storey
parking lots to ensure their safety.108 Similarly, laws
supporting disability parking privileges ensure that
persons with disabilities have access to parking that
does not present an undue hardship. For instance,
the UK’s blue badge disabled parking scheme helps
disabled people with severe mobility problems to
access goods and services, by allowing them to park
close to their destination.109
Private transport options for many elderly and
disabled travellers are also increasing (Box 6.8).
There are a number of stable non-motorized vehicles,
such as three-wheeled bicycles, hand-operated
bicycles and a variety of carts in use. In Bangladesh,

Box 6.8 Private transport for special groups
Many cities, particularly in developed countries, promote the
use of private transport for disabled people by licensing the
use of scooters, motorized three-wheelers or electric
wheelchairs. Furthermore, street or pavement designs are
modified to accept them. In Belgium, loans and grants are
provided for car-adaptation and training costs, both of which
allow disabled people to enter the labour force. In many parts
of the world, protected right or left turns are used as a safety
measure particularly for the elderly, as well as designated
turning lanes which aid in channelling the disabled away from
through-traffic.
Many elderly people prefer to use private motor
vehicles; however, the standards therein need to be tailored to

meet the needs of the elderly and frail. Car designs need to
take the functional mobility limitations of elderly, frail and
disabled groups into account. Extensive research in road
standards is important for finding the most suitable conditions
for disabled and elderly road users.
Although the issue of aging populations has been less of a
political issue in developing countries, it should be noted that
the conditions for many aging and disabled road users in such
countries are often deplorable, thus obstructing their right of
access.

hand-propelled tricycles provide valuable local
mobility and are environmentally friendly.110 Other
motorized vehicles on the market include electric
wheelchairs, three-wheeled motorized vehicles and
cars and vans with hand controls.
Fare structures allow governments to determine
who pays and who benefits.111 In countries such as
the UK, Denmark, Spain (Madrid) and Mexico
(Mexico City), just to mention a few, special
categories of passengers – such as students, children,
the elderly and the unemployed – travel free or at
least at a reduced fare.112 There is a strong case for
cross-subsidies to increase affordability, as has been
done in Bogotá, Colombia, where the fare for lowincome groups is subsidized by that of higher-income
groups.113 Integrated fare structures make it relatively
easy and less expensive for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to travel, particularly when undertaking
trip-chains. For example, in Denmark, financial grants
from the government have allowed integration of train
and regional bus services, enabling passengers
crossing regional borders to use a single ticket – even
if the journey requires a transfer involving different
public transport companies. Similar grants have
allowed free public transport for children under the
age of 12 who are accompanied by an adult.114

Increasing pedestrian accessibility and safety

Building exclusive sidewalks as components of road
and transport projects responds well to women’s
and other vulnerable users’ travel needs by increasing
pedestrian accessibility and safety. A majority of
cities in developed countries have launched a curbcut programme whereby all new sidewalks will be
built with curb cuts that allow wheeled pedestrian
traffic to negotiate the height change comfortably
while at the same time helping sight-impaired people
identify the street margin when using walking aids
such as a cane.115 Cities such as Mexico City, Rio de
Janeiro (Brazil) and Pretoria (South Africa) have
installed thousands of curb cuts to existing
footways.116 Agencies such as the World Bank are also
increasing their focus on improving infrastructure for
non-motorized transport.117
In Tokyo, Japan, a textured surface identifies the
change in level, including the direction, of the
pedestrian crossing.118 The textured area is bright

yellow and clearly visible, with curb cuts installed in
existing sidewalks. At key intersections, the timings
of the pedestrian crossing lights have been increased
by 20 per cent to accommodate the slower crossing
speed of elderly or disabled pedestrians.119 Locations
for the installation of light and sound signals for
pedestrian crossings are also identified. Different
sounds inform pedestrians whether or not it is safe
to cross and whether they are crossing in an east to
west direction or a north to south direction.120 In
Ottawa, Canada, for example, ‘peep-peep’ sounds are
used for east to west crossings and ‘cuckoo’ sounds
for north to south.121 Pedestrians may press a button
to activate the pedestrian crossing light. In some
cases, where there is sufficient wheelchair traffic,
wheelchair sensors may be installed.
The make-up of streets and the built environment can play a role in physical activity promotion
and active travel behaviours, especially among
children to and from school.122 For instance, the
availability of paved roads had a significant influence
in school attendance levels in a community in
Morocco. Attendance rates rose from 21 per cent to
48 per cent for girls and from 58 per cent to 76 per
cent for boys.123 School travel is an opportunity to
shift a portion of car trips to walking and cycling, if
accessibility, safety and the social benefits of the
experience are recognized and addressed.
n

‘Universal design’ or ‘access for all’

Across the globe, many countries are introducing
legislation that requires transport services to be
made more accessible, to conform to international
law (Box 6.9). South Africa, for example, has adopted
an integrated national disability strategy committed
to developing accessible and affordable public
transport. In 2010, the UK government passed an
act that covers accessibility issues related to age,
ethnicity, gender and disability as part of a single
integrated approach to ensure equal access for all.124
In Europe, and more recently in North America,
access to urban public transport has been transformed
by the introduction of low-floor vehicles.125 Passengers in wheelchairs can board the bus via a simple
ramp or directly from the sidewalk if the curb is raised
at stops. Inside the bus, there is space to park
wheelchairs and strollers, where they can be secured

Box 6.9 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Article 9, paragraph 1)
‘To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take
appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to
transportation, . . . and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public. . . . These measures, which shall include the
identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply to, inter alia: (a) Buildings, roads, transportation
and other indoor and outdoor facilities, including schools, housing, medical facilities and workplaces’.

with a clamp belt. This caters for people with small
children or baggage, persons with disabilities and frail
elderly persons.
In Delhi, India, a local NGO has worked with
transport authorities to make metro stations barrier
free; to include safety features and tactile guide
ways126 on platforms; and to ensure carriages have
adequate space for wheelchair users.127 Similarly, a
forum bringing together an advocacy group for the
disabled in Mexico City has led to thousands of kerb
ramps on major streets and the introduction of
accessible buses and trolley buses.128
Accessible taxis, both purpose-built and modified
vans, are also becoming more prevalent. In Canada,
the Province of Ontario offers a grant to adapt taxis
to accommodate all users.129 Private-sector companies
may adapt one or more of their fleet and provide
regular service and they send accessible taxis to
disabled passengers who call for them. A variation
on taxi service is the ‘Dial-a-ride’ service that works
in many cities in the US and the UK.130 In Berlin, a
‘telebus’ operates on the same principle.131 Often,
disabled passengers are given a ‘travel card’ and
then allowed a certain number of rides.
Some attempts have also been made to ensure
that information is availed to passengers in an easily
understood manner. For instance, a number of taxis
in Hong Kong have audio devices that provide the
taxi fare in English, Putonghua and Cantonese.132 It
is also important that authorities promote disability
awareness and training of public transport drivers and
conductors to improve the assistance they offer
passengers with special needs. Part of Mexico City’s
public information campaign aims to raise awareness
among the general public about the integrated system
of accessible pedestrian and transport services in the
city. Sensitivity training for taxi drivers has also been
considered.133

SAFETY AND SECURITY
IN URBAN MOBILITY
SYSTEMS
Safety and security are key components in creating
sustainable urban mobility systems, particularly in
making roads safer and more secure for vulnerable
and disadvantaged road users, including the poor.
Likewise, improving the safety and security of transport modes can be an extremely important step in
encouraging transport users to change to alternative (and more sustainable) modes. Numerous terror
attacks against urban infrastructure during the last
two decades have compelled stakeholders to understand transport security as more than a single element
of the global networks that move people and
goods.134 Once a routine component of modern
transportation, security now represents an urgent
national priority.

121

Global conditions, trends and challenges
This section examines the trends and impacts of
traffic accidents in urban areas.135 It considers
reducing the global burden of such accidents through
improved policies, road design and safety and traffic
management. It also looks at transportation security
more generally, in terms of people’s (real or perceived) assessments of personal security. Due to the
paucity of data on urban areas, this section refers to
road traffic accident data at the national level.
n

security are key

Road traffic accidents

Road traffic accidents are the ninth leading cause
of death worldwide, accounting for 2.2 per cent of
all deaths or 1.2 million deaths per year. The WHO
estimates that a further 20–50 million are injured in
road traffic crashes each year. The highest road traffic
fatality rates occur in Africa and the Middle East
(about 32 per year per 100,000 population). The
average road traffic fatality rate of developing
countries (about 20 per year per 100,000 population)
is nearly twice that of developed countries. In fact,
more than 90 per cent of fatalities occur in developing countries,136 despite the fact that these countries
have only 33 per cent of all registered vehicles.137
About half of the fatalities are in the most
productive age group (15–44 years). In the 15–29
years age group, road traffic accidents are the leading
cause of death. Males are overrepresented among
fatalities in all age groups.138 The most vulnerable
road users – pedestrians, cyclists and motorized twowheelers – account for nearly half of all road traffic
fatalities. And, as can be seen from Figure 6.3, the
proportion of fatalities among such vulnerable users
is significantly higher in developing countries than
in developed countries.
The predominance of vulnerable road-user
casualties in Asian and African countries can be
attributed to the unique traffic mix on the roads,
characterized by the abundance of vehicles and nonmotorized transport, as well as a lack of segregated
facilities in the road network.139 Poor enforcement
of traffic safety regulations due to inadequate
resources, administrative problems and corruption,
exacerbate the situation further.140 Arguably, the
number of accidents and fatalities is likely to increase
before they can be reduced, placing a strain on the
poor public health infrastructure in developing
countries. In India, road traffic injury patients account
for 10–30 per cent of all admissions to surgical
wards.141 Delays in emergency response time can
compromise the patient’s recovery, resulting in
adverse health outcomes and long-term disability.
Furthermore, lack of trained expertise in trauma care,
in many developing countries in particular, often
results in treatable injuries becoming permanent or
life threatening.142 The annual cost of road traffic
accidents in developing countries has been estimated

as at least US$100 billion a year.143 Add to this the
already considerable cost of congestion in cities, and
the combined cost of a lack of road safety and
accessibility is daunting.
Older pedestrians are also associated with very
high rates of road injury and death. In 2002, some
194,000 older persons (aged 60 years and above) died
as a result of road traffic accidents; this figure is
equivalent to 16 per cent of all such fatalities
globally.144 Despite elderly drivers having the lowest
crash rates of all age groups, there is a widespread
misconception that they are a threat to traffic
safety.145 In Japan, for instance, incentives such as
discounts in restaurants are offered to elderly drivers
aged 65 years and above to encourage them to give
up their licenses.146
Transport safety is not limited to private motorized vehicles only. Some 88 per cent of all motorized
travel in Mumbai, India, is by bus or rail.147 Accidents
at railway level crossings clearly dominate the railway
accident picture in Asia, where they are more
frequent and can also be more severe in their consequences, involving injuries and fatalities to railway
passengers, road vehicle occupants and other users
of railway level crossings. In several developing
countries, passengers in buses and informal transport
systems also constitute a significant group at high risk
of road traffic casualties.148 Along with the profit
motive of overloading, additional factors such as
reckless driving, poor driver training and driver
fatigue have led to the increased fatalities.
Most countries have some form of national
system for aggregating data on road crashes, using
police or hospital records, or both. However, the
quality and reliability of data on traffic accidents is
particularly weak in developing countries.149 There
is thus an urgent need for an effective system of
accident recording and analysis that would be useful
for a range of agencies (police, judiciary, emergency
personnel, etc.).

Transportation security: Risks and fears
related to the use of public transport
Across the globe, security risks and fear of crime
while engaged in transportation activities have skyrocketed. The terrorist attacks in Madrid, Spain
(March 2004)150 and London, UK (July 2005)151
show that public transport systems are vulnerable and
potential targets for terrorists. Transport hubs and
facilities have come under terrorist attacks as they
concentrate large numbers of people. When attacks
occur, there are disruptions in the public transport
service, which leave many commuters stranded.
Evidence suggests that passengers’ confidence in
the London metro and buses declined, and instead
preference was given to two-wheelers and bicycles.152
While the most dramatic attacks have occurred
mostly on major systems in major cities, this does
not mean that local bus services or smaller cities
are safe from attack. Crimes ostensibly unrelated to
the use of public transport – such as being robbed
or killed while waiting at a bus stop – discourage
many people from using public transport. Table 6.5
summarizes the four main types of threats to security
of person and property. In each case, while the
origin of the problem may not lie primarily in transport conditions, questions arise about the planning
and management of transportation facilities and
services. Sexual harassment is widespread in many
countries on and around public transport facilities,
and inadequate street lighting and poor design of
public transport stops tends to ‘facilitate’ sexual
harassment and gender violence.153
A growing phenomenon in many cities is the
expansion of criminal gangs that extort money from
transport operators and passengers. Nairobi, Kenya,
for instance, has seen the emergence of criminal
youth gangs such as Mungiki. In April 2003, over 50
armed Mungiki members attacked a matatu (minibus) crew, killing five people.154 These are indications
of widespread social malaise. While it affects the

transport behaviour of everybody, in most cases,
low-income groups cannot afford alternatives.155 As
a result, indispensable trips for work, health or
education are reduced.
It is also well established that older persons
have higher safety and security concerns than other
age groups.156 Many are aware of their frailty and
vulnerability, which make them susceptible to certain
forms of crime (such as bag snatching). This in itself
generates a range of safety concerns (i.e. road safety,
skateboard users in shopping malls, living alone,
etc.) that have implications for policy and
operations.157

Policy responses and innovative
practices
This section explores policy responses and examples
of good practice initiatives to reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety and transportation
security. It should be stressed that the type of traffic,
the mix of different categories of road users, and
the type of road traffic accidents in developing countries differ significantly from those in developed
countries. Furthermore, the traffic patterns of developing countries today have never been experienced
by developed countries in the past. Hence, technologies and policies cannot be automatically transferred
from developed to developing countries without
adaptation.
n

Reducing road traffic accidents

Most developed countries have been experimenting with radical measures to reduce the number and
severity of road traffic accidents. Based on a combination of engineering, enforcement and education
measures, improvements have been made in infrastructure design; vehicle characteristics (e.g. seatbelt
use, enacted by 57 per cent of countries surveyed
by the WHO158); and driving behaviour (including
speed limits and campaigns to dissuade drunkdriving). An estimated 96 per cent of countries have
a national or sub-national policy on drinking and
driving. Furthermore, some 49 per cent of countries

have restrictions on the blood alcohol concentration
of drivers.159 Sweden’s ‘vision zero’ initiative is exemplary, with a clear vision of reducing traffic accidents
to zero in the near future. Some three-quarters of
the significant reduction of deaths and injuries on
Swedish roads have been attributed to the effects
of the implemented traffic-calming measures.160 A key
lesson from these experiences, however, is the
importance of maintaining the goodwill of all road
users.161
In developing countries, the policy focus has
been on the protection of poor people who are
disproportionately affected by road traffic accidents
owing to the mixture of vehicles and unprotected
road users on the same roads (Box 6.10). Simple,
low-cost interventions have been found to have
a significant impact on their safety. For example,
in Accra and Kumasi (Ghana) the introduction of
speed bumps in the form of rumble strips and speed
humps resulted in a 35 per cent drop in road
crashes between 2000 and 2001.162 Road designers
in Malaysia are working towards new regulatory
guidelines requiring pedestrian risk assessments in
order to separate road users.163
With respect to new transportation projects,
mandatory safety audit procedures have existed in a
number of countries (including Australia, Denmark, New Zealand and the UK) for several years.164

Box 6.10 Rwanda’s road-safety programme
After the genocide that plunged Rwanda into mourning in
1994, the nation embarked on the improvement of its road
infrastructure that was damaged by the effects of war,
leading to many road traffic deaths. New regulations were
enforced in 2001, which included the mandatory wearing of
seatbelts, speed limits, vehicle inspections to ensure
standards of roadworthiness and limits on blood-alcohol
concentrations. These legislative changes were followed up
in 2003 by a public awareness campaign and a law
introducing further penalties for lack of seatbelt use or

123

failure to wear helmets on motorcycles. This led to a 30 per
cent reduction in traffic accidents.
The Rwandese government also introduced national
speed limits of 60 kilometres per hour, which is 20 kilometres
per hour lower than neighbouring countries. Plans to extend
this successful programme of road-safety measures include
further reinforcements for the traffic police to better enforce
the law, as well as more public education about how to
prevent accidents and observe good conduct.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 6.11 Toolkits for road safety
The International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) has
developed a toolkit that rates roads according to criteria for
safety design, maps fatalities and serious injuries across the
road network, and makes cost/benefit calculations for
fatality reductions based on implementation of proposed
countermeasures. It then applies tailored solutions. The
iRAP methodology provides:

A road inventory database with 30 inspected attributes
describing the network.
An estimate of the numbers being killed and seriously
injured on each inspected road.

Such procedures are also at various phases of implementation in developing countries such as India,
South Africa and Thailand.165
The enforcement of traffic regulations, governing all road users and vehicles, is essential for the
safety of cyclists, other non-motorized vehicle users
and motorcyclists. In Iran, a law was passed in 2004,
making the use of helmets compulsory countrywide
for motorcycle users. By 2007, fatalities per 100,000
inhabitants decreased from 38.2 to 31.8. Some
40 per cent of countries surveyed by the WHO have
a comprehensive motorcycle helmet law, in which
some countries have clearly defined standards for
both motorcycle drivers and their passengers.166
Exclusive motorcycle lanes can be created and
separated from the main carriageway by a physical
median, as observed in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). Box
6.11 presents a toolkit for addressing road safety.
Most countries provide some pedestrian
facilities, but in most cases the road environment is
not designed with pedestrians in mind. In many
developed countries ‘pedestrian refuges’ – elevated
islands designed usually in the middle of streets –
are a common feature to offer pedestrian safety
when crossing the road. Such crossings are rare in
developing countries. Instead, zebra crossings (where

In Malaysia, it has been estimated that an investment of
US$180 million in road design improvements could deliver
US$3 billion in benefits and prevent over 30,000 deaths and
serious injuries over 20 years. iRAP has pilot projects in
Chile, Costa Rica, Malaysia and South Africa showing positive
cost–benefit ratios. Positive economic outcomes combined
with the alleviation of human suffering make investment in

pedestrians are supposed to be granted immediate
priority over approaching vehicles) are provided in
some developing countries. Other low-cost pedestrian
facilities – which are affordable at a wide scale and
can be easily implemented – include pedestrian
footways, controlled signals for at-grade pedestrian
crossings, grade-separated crossings, and segregated
bicycle lanes. As evidenced by pilot projects, traffic
calming and the redesign of roads can reduce the
vulnerability of pedestrians and cyclists to road traffic
accidents.167
Other effective interventions for road safety
include better land-use management for optimized
traffic flow and the promotion of alternative modes
of transportation such as public transport (Box 6.12).
For instance, Singapore has been successful in reducing car journeys and alleviating traffic congestion
through a combination of integrated land-use and
transport planning, and demand-management measures. This can help to reduce traffic accidents by
minimizing the number and length of motorized
trips.168 Similarly, in Brazil, Curitiba’s high-capacity
traffic-management system has not only improved
urban transport and mobility but has also reduced
the number of accidents along its routes, through the
construction of safer infrastructure.169 Higher occu-

Box 6.12 Reducing road traffic fatalities in Bogotá, Colombia
Since 1993, Colombian legislation requires all vehicle owners
to be insured. As a result, a 3 per cent levy was instituted on
all vehicle insurance policies, earmarking that money for a
‘road accident prevention fund’. This resulted in Colombia’s
time-record high for the reduction of traffic fatalities – 7874
in 1995.
In Bogotá, several programmes have been introduced to
prevent and mitigate road traffic deaths and injury. Typically,

bars are closed at 1am instead of 3am, and citizens are
cautioned against driving under the influence of alcohol. The
stiff penalties deter people, who instead opt for alternative
means of transportation (such as carpooling), resulting in the
reduction of road traffic fatalities in Bogotá from 1387 in 1995
to 697 in 2002.

pancy vehicles are given priority in the road network,
thus reducing the exposure risk of pedestrians and
other road users. Surrounding areas have also been
improved with better lighting and other equipment
to make the transport system safer, more efficient
and more user friendly.
The responsibility for regulating traffic and
enforcing rules falls with the police. However, many
police agencies in developing countries are plagued
with poor enforcement of regulations – due to a lack
of resources, unsatisfactory systems or general
inefficiency on the part of the staff. Evidence suggests
that a sustained systemic approach to road policing,
with international support, can improve the performance (and image) of the police. A study of enhanced
traffic enforcement in Uganda showed a 17 per cent
drop in road deaths. The implemented scheme was
worth US$72,000 and an average cost-effectiveness
of US$27 per life year saved.170
Partnerships between community groups, civil
society and NGOs and the police can help in
preventing and mitigating traffic accidents, and
enforcing transport safety measures.171 For example,
in Bangalore, India, the World Bank’s Global Road
Safety Partnership has created partnerships to launch
a campaign against drunk-driving, and to improve
roadways in high-traffic areas to enhance safety.172
In addition, the Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention have been working with the ministries of
health and other groups in Mexico, Colombia and
El Salvador to reduce injuries to pedestrians, cyclists
and motor-vehicle occupants.173

Improving the safety and security of
vulnerable groups
‘Safe route to school’ programmes exist worldwide.174 Spearheaded by Denmark in the 1970s, the
programme focuses on engineering enforcement,
education and encouragement of safe walking and
cycling for schoolchildren.175 Under the Road Traffic
Act, police and local authorities are responsible for
the safety of children on school journeys. This
involves many improvements on local roads, including
slow-speed areas, ‘road narrowings’, traffic islands
and separate foot and bicycle paths. The programme
has been highly successful, and in some localities the
accident frequency has been reduced by 85 per
cent.176 Denmark’s experience with these programmes has provided an example for many other
countries worldwide.
Many European cities are working towards
limiting through-traffic on their streets to protect
children, deaf people and those in wheelchairs from
accidents.177 The Netherlands has developed an
amicable street-design solution for sharing of space
between pedestrian and motor traffic in residential
areas.178 Selected areas are designated woonerfs
(‘living streets’) and they are clearly marked with a
traffic sign based on the image of a house. The street
n

design is modified giving priority to pedestrians,
with the pavement clearly demarcating areas where
parking is acceptable. Through-traffic slows down due
to the judicious use of speed bumps and winding
thoroughfares. The harshness of asphalt and concrete
is softened with amenities such as trees and flower
boxes, small areas where children may play and
benches where adults may meet with each other.
By 2011 it was estimated that some 20 per cent
of the population of the Netherlands were living in
woonerfs.179 Similar initiatives have been introduced
in a number of other countries as well, including
Norway (where they are called gatetun)180 and the
UK (‘home streets’).
Since the 1980s, transport planners in some
countries have taken into consideration the personal
security of passengers using public transportation
systems, especially women. In Toronto, Canada, a
‘request stop’ service was launched in 1980 for the
hours after dark, allowing a female passenger to ask
the bus driver to stop along the route, where it is
more convenient for the woman to get off, not
necessarily at the bus stop. This was done to shorten
the woman’s walk between bus and destination. The
service was later adopted in Montreal in 1996,181 and
later in a few UK cities.182 Other measures taken to
improve the personal safety of passengers in Toronto
include increasing the presence of security personnel
in stations, adding more services at night and raising
awareness among station employees, drivers and
passengers.183
Environmental design plays an important role in
reducing crime in public transport. In the US, the
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority184
and the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal are
classic examples of success stories of applied security
design against crime in rail transport environments.185
In each case, environmental design shares the credit
for increased security with strategic policing, strict
maintenance procedures and ‘zero tolerance’ policies
in enforcing rules and regulations. Another example
of crime prevention through environmental design
is evident in the UK, where closed circuit television
cameras are used widely to monitor public spaces
such as shopping malls, car parks and a few residential
areas.186
The emergence of low-cost open-source mapping
tools; widespread cellular network coverage in developing countries; declining costs of mobile phone
hardware; and increasing internet use by public
agencies have resulted in unprecedented opportunities to support transport planning and management in developing countries.187 Some three-quarters
of the world’s inhabitants now have access to a
mobile phone. The number of mobile subscriptions
grew from fewer than 1 billion in 2000 to over 6
billion in 2012; nearly 5 billion of these are in developing countries. In 2011 alone, more than 30 billion
mobile applications, or ‘apps’ (the software that

Advances in technology now make it possible
to respond to specific needs, including those of
particularly vulnerable groups such as women,
persons with limited mobility and persons with disabilities. This could mean benefiting from new
opportunities through safer and easier transport
access. In Egypt, an innovative website ‘HarassMap’
was launched in December 2010 to help report and
map cases of harassment.189 Due to the affordable
and adaptable technology, victims of harassment are
able to anonymously report incidents by simply
sending an SMS message to this website.
Another innovation is the ‘Access Advisr’, a pilot
web application in the UK that uses crowd-sourcing
to identify local people’s needs in order to improve
accessibility to the existing public transport network
for disabled and older persons.190 The application
identifies problem areas for accessible transport, and
allows the review of information about the physical
infrastructure, and to rate it – through a live feedback community of users who can contribute their
views, photos and videos based on their own experiences.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY

Accessibility
planning is
viewed as a
mechanism for
ensuring equity
and reducing
mobility

Greater equity in
urban mobility is
an essential
prerequisite for
achieving
sustainable urban
mobility systems

Mobility is required to ensure access to basic goods,
services and activities, and in that sense it is essential to social equity. Restrictions on such access may
imply an abuse of human rights. In order to ensure
equitable access, cities need to understand the
transport needs of all urban dwellers, distinguishing
between the priorities of men and women, the young
and old, the able and the disabled. There is thus
a need to understand the purposes and uses that
would be derived from improved access, and the
constraints preventing those needs from being
fulfilled. While social objectives are often acknowledged in transport strategies, experiences show
that very little practice goes beyond pilot schemes
and case studies. Yet, the importance of the social
sustainability of urban transport cannot be underestimated; it is a key prerequisite for social development.
In theory, there are already both awareness
and some knowledge of the role that mobility plays
in terms of improving – or worsening – a person’s
quality of life. However, the complex dynamics are
often not well understood. This leads to a situation
whereby those responsible for taking action fall
back on traditional solutions; namely: infrastructure
development, improvement of conditions for private
transport, and lump-sum payments or untargeted

subsidies. Transport subsidy is an important policy
option for ensuring equitable transport access. However, it is essential that such subsidies are designed
carefully to target the poor and other vulnerable and
disadvantaged groups.
Good mobility policies should contribute to
poverty reduction by recognizing both the necessity
of improved macroeconomic efficiency, and the need
for direct targeting of transport interventions. There
has been a tendency to treat these two dimensions
of transport policy separately, with the result that an
effective and unified approach to urban mobility has
been lacking. One way of dealing with this is by
ensuring that poverty reduction becomes an explicit
objective of transport policies, with clear strategies
to bring the benefits of economic efficiency to poor
people, through redistribution and direct targeting
programmes, including preferential treatment of
specific vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.
In order to minimize poor accessibility, appropriate urban planning and land use is essential. As a
derived demand, transport infrastructure that enables
access to low-cost transport can make a crucial
contribution to poverty reduction. However, largescale transport infrastructure projects tend to benefit
high-income groups the most. The poor and other
low-income groups are often displaced to make way
for the projects, and may derive little or no benefit.
Accessibility planning is viewed as a mechanism
for ensuring equity and reducing mobility. Developing services and facilities on a localized basis that
places transport within easy and affordable reach of
the poor, forms a central principle within a sustainable urban mobility paradigm. Greater attention
should be given to investments in bus-priority and
non-motorized transport facilities, in order to reduce
the negative impacts of congestion. In some developed countries, it may even be possible to learn from
the experience of some developing countries, where
the urban poor are supported by the existence of
cheap (mostly informal) transport solutions. Many
low-cost actions can be implemented, which focus
on both walking and cycling facilities, especially in
poorly equipped areas. Such interventions could
contribute to the welfare of the urban poor, as well
as the economic activities of petty traders and
hawkers.
While great strides have been made in developing gender-appropriate transport policies and
universal design solutions, consistent implementation
is still lacking. Moving towards greater equity in urban
mobility is an essential prerequisite for achieving sustainable urban mobility systems. Concerted efforts
must be made by decision-makers to establish mobility systems that address the needs of all population
groups, especially the poor, the young, the elderly
and the disabled.

documents alone does not mean that gender is
successfully integrated in the transport sector.
Particular attention needs to be paid to gender issues,
and consideration given to the differential needs
and demands arising from varying gender contexts.
Similarly, it is increasingly being recognized that
there is a need for an analysis of gender that acknowledges income differences, in order to assess how
individuals experience urban mobility. Accordingly,
it is crucial that women are represented in the
planning, design and decision-making of all transport
investments (including user panels).
As noted earlier in this report, urban mobility
is primarily a means to an end: to provide access to
basic goods, services and activities. In this context, the core social requirement for an urban
mobility system is that it delivers its services equally
to different localities, interest groups and across
generations. Similarly, the negative impacts should
be distributed fairly among all users. Granting

equitable access for all will involve developing and
implementing appropriate measures and control
mechanisms, which include the following:
• Fare and pricing policies;
• Flexible routing and servicing;
• Establishing schedules that are considerate of
people’s activity patterns and time budgets;
• Acknowledging the importance of the services
provided by the informal sector and by nonmotorized transport;
• Introducing innovative transport services that also
make use of opportunities provided by information
and communication technologies;
• Addressing the safety and security concerns and
other needs of transport users;
• Eliminating gender biases by integrating the transport needs of women into transport policy and
planning processes.

CHAPTER

7

URBAN MOBILITY AND
THE ENVIRONMENT
The increasing mobility experienced in cities all over
the world brings enormous benefits to society and
also provides the essential means by which a city can
function effectively. The increasing urban mobility
is manifested in three major forms: an increase in
the number of trips made, an increase in the length
of each trip, and – last but not least – an increasing
motorization of urban people and goods movement.
The environmental consequences of the increased
motorization – and in particular the use of private
motorized vehicles (cars and motorcycles) – are
cause for major concerns, not only locally in the city,
but also globally, as the transport sector is one of
the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions,
the major cause of climate change.
In the past, it has often been argued that transport is an essential prerequisite for economic growth,
at least for cities at an early stage in their development. It has also been argued that this relationship
is not so important for cities in developed countries
where there is already an extensive network of
routes and where levels of accessibility are already
high.1 Recent debates have argued for prosperity
without growth,2 meaning that economic growth
(and transport) needs to be more closely aligned with
environmental and social priorities.
It is increasingly being acknowledged that urban
development has to be based not only on economic
growth, but also on social equity (and equal access)
and environmental sustainability. Thus interventions
in urban mobility systems should not only address
the economic benefits of higher levels of accessibility
(and mobility), but at the same time take account of
the social and environmental implications of following
particular policy pathways.3
The purpose of this chapter is to highlight environmental sustainability concerns within urban
mobility systems. This includes the identification of
environmental costs and a discussion of the means
by which their impacts can be reduced. The chapter
acknowledges that urban mobility will always use
resources and generate externalities,4 but its impact

on the urban environment can be substantially
reduced, so that it remains within acceptable limits
and makes a strong contribution to other aspects of
sustainability, including intergenerational concerns.
The first section of the chapter identifies the
main environmental challenges facing urban mobility,
focusing on oil dependence, greenhouse gas emissions, sprawl and human health concerns. This is
followed by five sections that discuss the policy
responses to these challenges. The second to fourth
sections focus on reducing the number of trips made,
reducing travel distances in cities and changing the
modal split towards non-motorized and public
transport. The fifth section discusses the potential
of technology in reducing the negative externalities
of motorization by addressing the efficiency and age
of the vehicle stock, standards of fuels used and
emissions from vehicles and alternatives to oil-based
fuels, and the need for increased efficiency in the
use of vehicles. The sixth section argues that, in
practical terms, a combination of several approaches
is likely to be most effective. This is followed by a
section that (briefly) discusses international funding
mechanisms to achieve environmentally sustainable
urban mobility systems. The final section contains a
brief summary and some major lessons for policy.

ENVIRONMENTAL
CHALLENGES IN URBAN
MOBILITY SYSTEMS
Environmental concerns have, over the last few
decades, become central to the debates about sustainable urban mobility. Yet, in practice, developmental objectives seem to take priority over
environmental concerns. A key message underpinning
the discussion in this chapter is the need to find the
means by which both developmental and environmental concerns can be addressed at the same time,
in mutually supporting ways.

The
environmental
consequences of
the increased
motorization . . .
are cause for
major concerns,

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Motorized urban transport relies almost entirely
(95 per cent) on oil-based products for its energy
supply, primarily in the form of petrol and diesel.5
The shift in urban transport technology toward
motorization has thus led to a significant increase in
the global consumption of such oil-based products.
While 45.4 per cent of global oil supplies were used
in the transport sector in 1973, this figure had
increased to 61.5 per cent in 2010. Thus, while the
total amount of oil used globally increased by 63 per
cent during the 1973–2010 period, the consumption
by the transport sector increased by 120 per cent.6
It has been estimated that the transport sector
accounts for about 22 per cent of global energy use.
The bulk of this (about two-thirds) is accounted for
by passenger transport, while the rest is consumed
by freight transport. As can be seen from Table 7.1,
cars and motorcycles (the bulk of which is private
motorized transport) account for nearly half of the
energy consumption of the entire transport sector.
The dependence on an oil-based energy supply
means that there has been a direct correspondence
between the amount of energy used in the transport
sector and the emissions of CO2, the main transportrelated greenhouse gas. CO2 emissions from the
transport sector have remained constant at about 23
per cent of total energy-related CO2 emissions during
the 1973–2009 period.7 Given the considerable
growth in urban travel demand globally (as the
world’s urban population is projected to increase by
40 per cent between 2010 and 2030),8 mitigation
technologies and practices are urgently required to
achieve a significant global reduction in carbon-based
energy use for urban transport.
There are, however, a number of other significant impacts of oil-based transport energy on both
the natural environment and the built environment.
This section focuses on these impacts and related
environmental challenges. The environmental conditions of cities vary significantly – both between
and within cities. Yet, many of the problems arising
from the transport sector affect all urban residents

(although, in many cities, the poor suffer disproportionally from many of the negative externalities
of urban transportation) and impacts upon health and
the quality of life in cities in general. Four major
clusters of challenges are discussed below, namely:
motorization and oil dependence; mobility and
climate change; dependence on motorized forms of
transport and urban sprawl; and human health
concerns.

Motorization and oil dependence
Despite the many negative impacts arising from
dependence on oil-based energy products in the
transport sector, the sector is likely to remain a
premium user of such products. There are many
reasons for this, the most prominent of which are
listed below:
• Oil-based products have the highest energy density
of all fuels.9 Thus, any change to alternative fuels
(e.g. biofuels, solar, hydrogen or electricity) needs
to be examined with caution in light of the
quantity of such alternative fuels required to
travel a given distance.
• There are currently no substitutes to oil-based
products that are available in the quantities
required.
• Considerable investments have already been made
in the infrastructure supporting oil-based transportation (i.e. fuel stations and oil refineries).10
However, global supplies of oil are not unlimited,
and they are often subject to political interference.
The politically induced oil shortages of the 1970s
and the rapid price increases during the last decade
(Figure 7.1) have exemplified the potential consequences of reductions in oil supply, as a component
of national energy security.11 The urban poor in
developing countries are especially hit hard by
increased petrol prices. In 2011, Kenya experienced
a shortage in petrol supply, followed by a rise of

30 per cent in petrol prices within a few months.12
Car owners slowly decreased their number of trips;
however the mounting prices had an immediate
effect on public transport. Privately owned bus lines
initially decreased the frequency of legs collecting
passengers to maintain profitability, followed by
the suspension of multiple public transport lines
by owners, while at the same time demanding the
government lower petrol prices. As a result, the
urban poor living at the fringes of the city suffered
the most, unable to travel long distances to earn a
living.
In the short term, the transport sector is
prepared to pay for the higher costs of energy, and
most savings in the use of carbon-based energy
sources will come from the use of more efficient
technology within the conventional petrol and diesel
vehicles. In the longer term, however, and irrespective of the wider environmental impacts, the transport sector needs to diversify its sources of energy
and to de-carbonize the sources of fuel used.13
High and volatile prices have encouraged some
countries to subsidize fuel prices to protect their own
motorists from increasing world prices for petrol and

diesel. Other countries impose various taxes on such
commodities. Thus, the pump price for petrol varies
considerably between (and also within) countries,
from US$0.02 per litre in Venezuela to US$2.54
in Eritrea (Figure 7.2). The political rationale for
subsidizing fuel prices varies dramatically from one
country to another.14 However, the perverse effect
of fuel subsidies has been to encourage more car
travel. And, it can be argued that fuel subsidies
primarily benefit car owners. Targeted subsidies
to public transport are a better alternative if the
objective is to make transport more affordable to the
urban poor. In general, fuel prices should not be
subsidized for the sake of short-term political interest
(Box 7.1), as it is important that the full environmental
costs of fuels are paid by the user. This is known in
international law as the ‘polluter pays principle’.15
It has been estimated that ‘a universal phase-out of
all fossil-fuel consumption subsidies by 2020 would
cut global primary energy demand by 5%’, with
savings predominantly in the transport sector.16 If
fuel subsidies are to be retained, it is often argued
that it would be better to subsidize renewable energy
sources, to encourage a shift away from fossil fuels.17

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 7.1 Fuel subsidies
With high oil prices (over US$100 a barrel), many countries
are not passing on these costs to users, as fossil fuels are
needed for cooking, heating, electricity generation as well
as powering engines and vehicles. The International Monetary
Fund estimates the global bill for fuel subsidies reached
US$250 billion in 2010, up from US$60 billion in 2003.a
Some 40 per cent of this amount are subsidies for oil
products (the rest being natural gas, electricity and coal).b
Other sources quote even higher levels of fossil fuel
subsidies, namely: ‘$523 billion in 2011, up almost 30% on
2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables’.c
For oil-producing countries fuel subsidies are part of a
social contract and can be managed. In Iran alone, the total
value of oil subsides reached nearly US$25 billion in 2005.b
But for non-oil producers it creates an additional fiscal burden
and it means that investments in other sectors are delayed as
foreign currency is used to pay for the oil. In India, it is
estimated that fuel subsidies have added US$20 billion, or
1 per cent of GDP, to the national budget.a

Most of those that argue for the continuation of
subsidies on fossil fuels argue that this is done to assist the
poor. In practice, however, this is rarely the case; as ‘only 8%
of the subsidies to fossil-fuel consumption in 2010 reached the
poorest 20% of the population’.d The figure is even lower for
petrol and diesel, where only 6 per cent of the total subsidy
went to the poorest 20 per cent of the population.e
For political reasons, ‘Governments like to keep
subsidies “off-budget” since “on-budget” subsidies are an easy
target for pressure groups interested in reducing the overall
tax burden. For this reason, subsidies often take the form of
price controls that set prices below full cost, especially where
the energy company is state-owned, or of a requirement on
energy buyers to take minimum volumes from a specific,
usually domestic, supply source. Subsidies may be aimed at
producers, such as a grant paid for each unit of production, or
at consumers, such as a rebate or exemption on the normal
sales tax’.f

Table 7.2

Cities make greater efficiency in their use of
energy for transport than less densely populated
locations, as more efficient public transport can
replace the need to use a private car, and as distances
are shorter. The relative energy efficiencies for
different modes of transport in 84 cities are shown
in Table 7.2. The occupancy rates for public transport vehicles are central to the interpretation of this
table. The substantial differences in energy efficiency
between cities in the different regions are partly due
to the technology being used, but also to the
occupancy levels. For example, China has high levels

is that there is a significant potential to reduce

encouraging more people to use public transport.

Climate Convention, entered into force in 1994. Its
ultimate objective is to stabilize global greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that
will prevent human interference with the climate
system. In order to achieve this, many developed
countries committed (through the Kyoto Protocol)
to reduce their overall greenhouse gas emissions by
at least 5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.18
Although some countries have managed to meet
their commitments, many other countries (primarily
those that did not commit to reductions) have increased their greenhouse gas emissions dramatically.
Global emissions of CO2 have increased by nearly 50
per cent between 1990 (20.97 billion tonnes)19 and
2010 (30.6 billion tonnes).20
Globally, the CO2 emissions from the transport
sector have increased by 85 per cent from 3.593
billion tonnes in 1973 to 6.665 billion tonnes in
2007.21 With respect to the targets of the Kyoto
Protocol, the emissions have increased by over 47
per cent during the 1990–2007 period.22
There is considerable variation in the amounts
of CO2 produced by different countries and regions.
A similar variation applies to the emissions from the
transport sector. As can be seen from Table 7.3, the
transport emissions per capita in North America are
more than four times the global average, and more
than double that in other OECD countries. The CO2
emissions from transportation are much lower in
developing countries. The emissions in most of Asia
and Africa are about a third or a quarter of the global
average, the notable exception is the Middle East,
where the transportation emissions per capita are
similar to those in Europe. Even more striking: while
the overall CO2 emissions per capita in the US are
some 2.5 times higher than in China, the CO2
emissions per capita from transportation in the US
are 12 times as high as in China.
As indicated in Table 7.1, road and maritime
freight accounts for about 25 per cent and 10.6 per

cent of the CO2 emissions, respectively. Aviation
accounts for another 12.4 per cent, while the
emissions from rail transport are insignificant. The
remaining 52 per cent of CO2 emissions are being
produced from passenger road transport.23 For all
parts of the world, more energy (and CO2 emissions)
per capita is used in private than in public transport;
in Africa the ratio is 3:1, while it is 50:1 in the US.24
At the city level, there is considerable variation
in energy use between cities. For example, more than
half the total energy consumption in Mexico City and
Cape Town is transport based,25 while the levels in
many European cities (for example, London and
Paris) are about a quarter.26 This reflects the differences between cities in terms of their structure, their
urban form, their densities, their levels of sprawl, the
importance of public transport and the balance
between energy use in transport and other sectors.
Figure 7.3 shows variations in CO2 emissions
from passenger transport across cities in various
parts of the world. The emissions are highest in US,
followed by Canadian and Australian cities, with
emissions in the range of 2–7.5 tonnes per capita.
Most European cities have emissions in the range of
1–2 tonnes per capita. Most developing country
cities, however, have significantly lower emissions.
To provide a specific example: the mobility patterns
of each resident of Atlanta, US, produce about 150
times as much CO2 emissions as those of a resident
of Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. Figure 7.3 also shows
that, in most cities, the emissions from public transport are insignificant compared to those from private
motorized transport.
Nearly one-half of the world’s cities are located
on the coast or along major rivers. These locations
have in the past been subject to occasional flooding,
but these risks have increased as a result of more
frequent storm surges and high winds, accentuated
by global warming and sea-level rise. The vulnerability
of these cities to flooding has thus been substantially

There is . . . an
immediate need
for cities to take
action to protect
the existing
transport
infrastructure
from the impacts
of climate change

For [the poorest
and most
vulnerable]
groups, urban
sprawl often leads
to social isolation

increased, and some have taken action to reduce the
potential impacts. However, some 40 million people
are still exposed to a 1 in 100 year coastal flood event,
and this will rise to 150 million in 2070.27 A recent
survey of 90 cities indicates that severe flooding
and storm-water management is among the top three
challenges facing cities.28 Transport is central to the
functioning of cities, and it is often the transport
system that is initially affected by flooding and high
temperatures. Yet, it is that same transport system
that is required to provide access to the locations that
have become isolated as a result of flooding. Furthermore, when urban transport infrastructure fails
this can have far-reaching economic consequences,
as people cannot get to work and goods cannot be
distributed.29
There is thus an immediate need for cities to
take action to protect the existing transport infrastructure from the impacts of climate change. This
includes continuous maintenance, but may also
require additional investments in drainage, erosion
control and protective engineering structures. At the
same time, cities all over the world should integrate
planning for climate change with general land-use
planning to reduce vulnerability for new developments. This should include limitations on developments in flood-prone locations. The infrastructure
itself can be designed to be more resilient to high
temperatures (e.g. buckling of rail, effects on metallic
bridges, etc.), and should be raised above the levels
of the surrounding countryside to allow passage
during flooding. Furthermore, drainage systems
should be designed with a capacity to move flood
waters away from the infrastructure.30 Moreover,
improvements to existing, or development of new,
transport infrastructure should take into account

the requirements of the whole urban population,
including vulnerable and disadvantaged groups (see
Chapter 6).31

Dependence on motorized forms of
transport and urban sprawl
Increasing levels of motorization have, in most cities,
resulted in lower densities and decentralization,
with the second-round effect that suburban living has
generally encouraged the ownership of a car. Motorization also exacerbates congestion, which can have
the knock-on effect of increasing travel times on
public transport, thus further encouraging travel by
private cars. While, in many cities, buses tend to be
unreliable (due partly to congestion),32 the car seems
to offer more control as alternative less congested
routes can be used, giving the driver greater flexibility. For those with access to a car, mobility levels
increase and many also want to live in lower density
developments. This gives rise to urban sprawl. This
in turn makes it difficult to provide alternatives to
the car.33 Such development has been common in
locations where land is available and cheap.34
However, not everyone can afford a private car,
leading (in many cities) to a social stratification
of urban transport systems. The poorest and most
vulnerable groups (including women, children, youth,
elderly and disabled persons) cannot afford to (or are
unable to use) private cars.35 For these groups, urban
sprawl often leads to social isolation.36
In addition to more space being taken up by
low-density developments, transport systems in
such settlements also use substantial amounts of
space for roads, railways, car parks and other
associated infrastructure. The loss of agricultural

land and the changing local climate resulting from
greater amounts of land being allocated to urban
development (and motorized transport) mean that
there may be increased fragmentation of natural
habitats, reductions in biodiversity and impacts on
local ecosystems as roads act as barriers.37 An
Australian study found that energy use in suburban
households was 50 per cent higher than those in the
urban centre, and this was explained primarily by
greater car use and longer journeys.38 Other countries (for example, China) now have the problem
of loss of productive land as cities spread and as car
ownership levels increase. In Hyderabad (India),
which more than doubled its population between
1980 and 1999,39 the urban land take increased from
9 per cent to 24 per cent of the total land available
(1980–1999). This resulted in a 24 per cent reduction of the agricultural land area.40

Road traffic accidents, which are perhaps the most
prominent human health concern from urban
mobility, are discussed in Chapter 6, as part of the
discussion on urban safety and security.

Air pollution

The impacts of air pollution on air quality and human
health are gaining increasing attention by residents
and local governments alike.41 Worldwide, it has
been estimated that ‘a record 3.2 million people died
from air pollution in 2010, compared with 800,000
in 2000’.42 The impacts of transport-related air
pollution affect all urban residents, but there is
substantial evidence that it affects the poor and
vulnerable groups more than others. In fact, the social
groups that are most seriously impacted are often not
those that cause the pollution.43 The main groups of
local air pollutants – nitrogen oxides, volatile organic
compounds, carbon monoxide and particulate matter
(as well as some other pollutants) – are described in
Box 7.2.
Trucks and other freight carriers emit disproportionate amounts of pollutants in cities. Even

Human health concerns
The increased motorization of urban transport is
also causing serious challenges to human health. This
section summarizes the main physical health concerns related to air and noise pollution, reduced

Box 7.2 Air pollutants
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) when combined with other air
pollutants can lead to respiratory difficulties and reduced lung
functions, particularly in urban areas (where densities lead to
higher concentrations). In the 32 member countries of the
European Environment Agency, transport emissions of NOx
have reduced by 32 per cent (1990–2008) through the
introduction of catalytic converters, but this reduction has
been offset by some growth in traffic.a In many developing
countries the add-on technology is not mandatory and traffic
has been growing at a rapid rate.
Volatile organic compounds comprise a wide variety of
hydrocarbons and other substances (e.g. methane and
ethylene) that result from the incomplete combustion of fossil
fuels. When combined with NOx in heat and sunlight,
hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds generate lowlevel ozone, a main contributor to photochemical smog. Their
impact has a measurable effect on respiratory functions and as
an irritation, but these levels are declining as technologies
improve.b
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odourless and almost
colourless gas, which is very toxic as it interferes with the
absorption of oxygen. This in turn can lead to increased
morbidity and can affect fertility and general levels of health.
The transport sector is a major contributor as carbon
monoxide comes principally from the incomplete combustion
of fuel.b
Particulate matter consists of very small particles (under 10
microns in diameter: PM10), that come mainly from diesel fuels,

tyre particles and road dust. They can cause cancer, worsen
heart and breathing problems for sensitive groups and may
lead to premature mortality for all urban residents.
Among 59 cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America, only two
meet standards for PM10, while 46 of the cities exceeded the
standard by more than twice (WHO standard is 90 milligram
per cubic metre).c Cities in developing countries are most at
risk, partly due to minimal enforcement. In Beijing, China, the
government shut down ‘103 heavily polluting factories and
took 30% of government vehicles off roads to combat
dangerously high air pollution . . . but the . . . air remained
hazardous despite the measures’ in January 2013. The reason
was that the amount of PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of less
than 2.5 microns) reached more than 500 milligram per cubic
metre, on a scale where 300 is considered hazardous, while
the WHO recommends a daily level of no more than 20.d
Similar high levels have also been reported in other Asian
cities, such as New Delhi, India.e
Other pollutants – such as lead (Pb), ammonia (NH3) and
sulphur dioxide (SO2) – have transport links but are less
important than the four listed above, as they are being
reduced through the switch to different and ‘cleaner’ fuels and
new designs for catalytic converters. However, many cities still
allow the use of leaded petrol, despite the known dangers for
children and their mental development.

Noise pollution

Noise and vibration are often cited as nuisances to
people living in urban areas, but it is often the peak
or unexpected noises that are most problematical.
In developed countries, about 130 million people are
exposed to unacceptable noise levels over 65dB(A),
and 400 million to inconvenient levels of over
55dB(A).45 In some ‘quiet’ countries (parts of
Scandinavia) only 5 per cent of residents are exposed,
while up to 30 per cent of residents in ‘noisy’ cities
can be exposed.46 Prolonged exposure to noise can
lead to anxiety, depression and insomnia.47 Vibration
is caused by all vehicles, but it is heavy trucks that
cause most intrusion and this again affects sleep,
increasing levels of stress and anxiety.48 Noises from
horns are common in many cities, and car alarms also
cause nuisance to residents. In Moscow, around
three-quarters of the population live in areas with
levels of transport noise that exceed WHO
standards.49

Human health and physical activity

There are also major health effects resulting from the
lack of physical activity that accompanies increased
motorization. The perceived danger of walking and
cycling is a strong disincentive to non-motorized
transport.50 As more people travel by motorized
transport, the risks to vulnerable road users increase,
and, as a result, fewer people walk and cycle. There
is growing evidence of the links between physical
inactivity and weight, and of the impacts that these
two factors have on the risk of diabetes, heart disease,
colon cancer, strokes and breast cancer.51 Foodenergy intake has not decreased in line with
reductions in physical activity, and many countries
are experiencing an epidemic in obesity.52
According to the Global Burden of Disease Study,
overweight and obesity accounts for 36 million
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost, with
physical inactivity accounting for a further 32 million
DALYs.53 In the UK, about 66 per cent of adults do
not get enough exercise, and the majority of the
population is now overweight or obese.54 The links
between health and non-motorized transport need
to be emphasized through education programmes and
the involvement of doctors. Copenhagen, Denmark,
is often cited as a good example of a cycling city as
there are numerous initiatives, both private and
public, to promote cycling.55
In a study of 30,000 people over a 14 year
period, it was found that cycling to work reduced
the risk of mortality at a given age by 39 per cent
relative to those that did not cycle, and over half of

cyclists (54 per cent) cite speed and convenience as
their main reason for cycling, meaning that their
journey times were reduced.56

Community severance, open spaces and
mental health
Community severance divides and fragments communities, and is often a result of heavily used
transport infrastructure forming a barrier so that
people cannot cross the road or rail track. It adversely
affects the quality of life, the level of activities on
the street and the amount of social interaction within
communities. It is particularly important for young
people who are trying to socialize, and who often
come to the understanding that the urban space
surrounding them belongs to motorized vehicles
rather than people.57
The reallocation of space from people to cars
means that roads are widened and the space available
for non-motorized modes is reduced. Furthermore,
the expansion of roads often competes with open and
green spaces (as well as squares and other spaces that
allow people to spend time together). These spaces
are important for the quality of life, and for their role
in providing the ‘lungs’ of the city. Much of these
spaces are open to the public and can be used for
recreational and sporting activities, as well as
providing habitat for wildlife and for absorbing
carbon.58
There is also evidence that traffic congestion
can impair ‘health, psychological adjustment, work
performance and overall satisfaction with life’.59
Research indicates that job satisfaction and commitment declines with increased road commuting
distance (but not with public transit use), and that
perceived traffic stress is associated with both lower
general health status and depression.60 According to
the 2011 IBM commuter pain survey, 42 per cent
of respondents stated that their stress levels (due to
congestion) had increased and 35 per cent reported
increased anger.61 Additional environmental effects
of traffic congestion include pedestrian/vehicle conflicts on congested streets, which cause safety
concerns and traffic delays, visual intrusion caused
by elevated roads, bus stations, etc., and distorted
city image, which disturbs liveability and reduces
tourism potential.62
n

REDUCING THE NUMBER
OF MOTORIZED TRIPS
There are many opportunities to reduce the need to
travel by motorized transport. One is to travel by nonmotorized means instead (i.e. walking or cycling).63
Cycling can be encouraged for many shorter trips (i.e.
normally less than 10 kilometres), provided that the
infrastructure is available, including space to securely

Box 7.3 A successful bicycle sharing system, Changwon, the Republic of Korea
The city of Changwon is working towards becoming Korea’s
leading ‘eco-rich city’, by improving the quality of life through
sustainable mobility and non-motorized transportation. As a
part of this effort, the ‘Nubija’ bicycle sharing system was
introduced on 22 October 2008, with 20 parking stations
(where bikes can be checked out and returned) and a total of
430 bicycles.
The system has since increased steadily, and by 2011
there were 163 parking stations (with 3300 bicycles). At that
time, the membership of the scheme had reached 76,579,

leave the bicycle. More imaginative innovations are
the cycle hire schemes that are now a feature of many
cities (see for example Box 7.3), where old technology
(the bicycle) has been matched up with the new
technology (smartcards), so that bikes can be used
on demand, either free for an initial period or for a
reasonable charge. Another good example is that of
Paris, France, which has introduced a popular bike
sharing scheme (vélib) and aims to increase the city’s
network of bike lanes to some 700 kilometres by
2014.64 The co-benefits are manifest for the user
(healthy and fast) and for the transport system (less
space is used). However, it should be noted that the
potential for increased bicycle use is related to age
and (dis)ability, as well as prevalent cultural
constraints, that may, for example, limit the use of
bicycles by women.
Unfortunately, in many cities of developing
countries the promotion of cycling as an alternative
to motorized travel is fraught with danger, due to
lack of dedicated bicycle lanes, forcing riders into
a rather uneven competition for road space with
motorized vehicles. There are some positive developments though. The City of Buenos Aires, Argentina,
for example has since 2010 developed a 94-kilometre
network of protected bike lanes, and introduced a
bike-share programme featuring more than 22
stations and over 850 bikes. The City intends to
expand its bike lane network to 130 kilometres by
2013.65 Similarly, the two Egyptian cities of Fayoum
and Shebin El Kom are planning the construction
of 14 kilometres of cycling tracks and improved
sidewalks on major streets.66
Another means to reduce the number of trips
is through trip-chaining, where several activities are
undertaken on one tour (from home back to home)
rather than as a series of several individual trips. This
again reduces overall distance travelled, but needs
to be matched by the location of destinations in
close proximity to each other and by mixed-land
uses.67
The most effective way of reducing the number
of trips (at least in theory) is that a specific trip is no
longer made as it has been replaced by a non-travel

who ride an average of 4396 kilometres per day. By early 2012
it was reported that the number of parking stations had
reached 230.
The bicycle sharing system has led to annual emissions
reduction of more than 4000 tonnes of CO2 by 2011. Other
outcomes have been reduced energy consumption, lower
levels of air pollution and better public health.

activity or substituted through technology, for
example internet shopping (Box 7.4). For many years
now there have been debates over the potential for
teleworking, teleactivities and teleconferencing,68
and the more recent advent of mobile technology has
opened up many new possibilities.69 Although there
is a large substitution potential, the relationships
seem to be symbiotic with a greater opportunity for
flexibility in travel patterns, as some activities are
substituted, while others are generated, and some
replaced by fewer longer distance journeys.70
The introduction of new technology has extended to mobile phones, and these have become
available worldwide, often changing lives through
allowing social and business communications. It is
unclear about the implications for travel, but the
effects are likely to be positive for the environment,
as less carbon-based energy will be used.71 Conventionally, the impacts of mobile phones have been
grouped into three categories: incremental (improving the speed and efficiency of what people already
do), transformational (offering something new) and
related to production (selling mobiles and related
services). The impact of mobile phones has been
most profound in developing countries, where
telephone communications in the past were reserved
for the rich.72

The most effective
way of reducing
the number of
trips . . . is that a
specific trip is no
longer made as it
has been replaced
by a non-travel
activity or

Box 7.4 Internet shopping
Sainsbury’s is the third largest chain of supermarkets in the UK. Sainsbury’s Online is
the internet shopping brand, where customers choose their grocery items online and
items are delivered to customers from a local store (165 stores operate an online
service) by van. This service is available to nearly 90 per cent of the UK population.
In 2005, Sainsbury’s Online tested Smith Electric Vehicles in its home shopping
delivery applications in and around Central London. The year-long trial proved so
successful that Sainsbury’s placed an order for eight vehicles in 2007 and a further 50
in 2008. Each zero emission van will reduce emissions by 5 tonnes of CO2 per year.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

REDUCING TRAVEL
DISTANCES IN CITIES

Urban planning
has a major role to
play in organizing
spatial activities
in cities so that
they are in close
proximity to their
users

Regardless of the
form of the city, it
is important to
develop around
highly accessible
public transport
nodes so that the
attractiveness of
these areas is fully
realized

Urban spatial structure (or urban form)73 is important
in determining transport mode and distance travelled,
as it links the spatial distribution of population
and jobs within the city to the pattern of trips. Thus,
urban planning has a major role to play in organizing spatial activities in cities so that they are in close
proximity to their users. Two important factors
are at work here. First, if travel distances are reduced
then accessibility is improved as activities can be
undertaken with less travel. Second, if travel distances are short, then it becomes more attractive to
walk and cycle – particularly if space is allocated for
exclusive rights of way – and to use public transport,
and this in turn reduces the energy use and the
environmental impacts of transport.
Such an approach implies that the available
street space in cities can be optimized for the highest
number of users. An increased focus on urban planning means that the city operates more efficiently,
but it also increases equity as services and facilities
become accessible to the entire population. Optimization of street space, however, is not only a matter
of urban planning. Efficient traffic engineering design,
supply and demand management, enforcement of
traffic law and efficient governance at the city level
are necessary requisites for introducing and sustaining urban transport services and facilities in developing countries.
Many cities in developing countries are growing
rapidly, driven by inward migration and population growth. This implies a considerable potential
for urban planning to keep travel distances as short
as possible. Peripheral sprawl needs to be discouraged
as it uses valuable agricultural land, because it increases travel distances and makes the provision of
public transport more difficult. The arguments for

high urban densities are strong on both transport and
land take reasons, and cities should be encouraged
to build upwards (higher buildings) and not outwards
(suburban sprawl).74
Regardless of the form of the city, it is important
to develop around highly accessible public transport nodes so that the attractiveness of these areas
is fully realized. These areas integrate land use and
transport through the promotion of high-density
development around accessible points and interchanges on the public transport network, facilitating walking and cycling and increased use of public
transport systems. Development needs to include
mixed uses, covering housing, jobs, schools, shops,
health facilities, educational services (e.g. crèches)
and recreational opportunities, so that all activities
can take place in one location. Such developments
are particularly important for women, who often have
quite complex travel patterns.75
Transport development areas often become
the new mega nodes within cities where people meet
to carry out their business and social activities, and
they consequently promote social cohesion. These
public transport interchanges can thus become the
new commercial hubs for cities, for example in
Canary Wharf, London (Box 7.5) and Shin Yokohama
(Japan). Singapore (Table 7.4) has also constructed
public housing close to the metro stations, and this
allows lower income people access to both housing
and transport.76 Such public transport interchanges
can often be financed by developers, as has been the
case in Hong Kong, Singapore, Frankfurt and London.
Apart from the major contribution that transport
development areas can play in encouraging sustainable mobility in cities, they are seen as central to the
urban regeneration process that involves the creation
of new city places and spaces, and there is usually
strong community involvement so that the benefits
can be widely distributed across all social groups.

Box 7.5 Transport accessibility to Canary Wharf, London, UK
Canary Wharf is a major business and financial district located
in the eastern part of London. It contains around 1.3 million
square metres of office and retail space and a workforce of
around 93,000 people (in 2009). It is home to global or
European headquarters of numerous major banks, professional
services firms and media organizations.
Construction began on the old docks area in 1988 as
part of a major urban regeneration programme. A key element
of the planning was to ensure high-quality access by public
transport through the extension of the Jubilee Line metro, the
new Docklands Light Railway, improved bus services, river
boat services and cycle routes. There is little parking available,
but a substantial amount of residential development has taken
place in the riverside areas surrounding Canary Wharf.
A survey was carried out in June/July 2009 within the

local areas and Canary Wharf to measure the movement of
people throughout the area and in particular those travelling
to Canary Wharf. During the survey period only 5.1 per cent
of workers at Canary Wharf travelled by car, down from 6.2
per cent in 2007. Cycling has increased in popularity across
London and Canary Wharf is no exception. Nearly 4 per cent
of workers cycled to work in 2009, up from 2.9 per cent in
2007.
Use of public transport, including the Jubilee Line and the
Docklands Light Railway, continues to increase, especially from
areas east of Canary Wharf, reflecting the area’s rapid
regeneration and the increased number of Canary Wharfbased workers living in East London. About 90 per cent of all
people coming to Canary Wharf do so by public transport.

New York City (population 8.2 million in 790km2)
Background information: Manhattan (population 1.6 million) covers
53km2 and has 35 per cent of the total regional jobs, with the Midtown
having 2160 jobs per hectare.
Measures:
• Strict zoning with ‘floor area ratio’ 11–15.a
• Mixed zoning – office, commercial, recreational and housing.
• Transit system operational throughout 24 hours.
• Parking spaces taxed by municipality, and most parking is provided
privately and off-street.
• Increasing the subway network to 337 kilometres – transit density of
56 kilometres per million population.
• Encourage walk and cycle – 21 per cent trips in New York City are walk
and cycle and a further 55 per cent by mass transit.
• Ensure the working environment is intellectual, fertile and innovative.

Singapore (population 5 million in 700km2)
Background information: Singapore has a compact urban structure
supported by high-quality public transport.

• Public housing areas some located at metro stations to give easy access to
employment.
• Some decentralization to regional centres to reduce travel distances.
• Reductions in need to travel and dependency on car though providing

• Rail network to double from 138 kilometres to 278 kilometres by 2020
(US$14 billion) – transit density of 51 kilometres per million population
(2020).

CHANGING THE MODAL
SPLIT
Transport policy has often been strongly orientated
towards maintaining and increasing the levels of
public transport use in the city. However, success has
been limited, as other factors have intervened, such
as increases in incomes and growing urban populations. These factors have meant that the car and the
motorcycle have become dominant. It is important to
the quality of life and to the environment that as much
urban travel as possible is undertaken by nonmotorized and public transport, as these modes are
the most environmentally efficient. In many European cities up to 60 per cent of all trips are made
by walking, cycling or public transport. A survey of
26 cities in four EU countries indicated that the
proportion of trips by car ranges from 17 to 73 per
cent. The interesting point to note from this survey
is the variability in modal shares, and that there does
not seem to be any direct relationship between
population density (or size) and the prevalence of
specific transport modes.77 However, high-capacity
public transport systems, such as BRT, can offer a
viable alternative to car dependence in cities of
developing countries (see Box 7.6).

It is essential that the full cost of the energy used
in transport, including all externalities, is reflected
in the price.78 Real cost increases reduce the amount
of energy used (and thus the greenhouse gases emitted) and reduce travel distances (as they encourage more local travel) and the greater use of nonmotorized and public transport. This full economic
price could be based on the carbon content of the
fuel, but it also needs to include a number of other
external factors.79 There are three basic groups of
strategies that can be used to encourage modal shift
to more energy-efficient forms of transport, namely:
regulatory measures, pricing measures and investments in public transport.80
Regulatory measures can place limitations
on the numbers of vehicles on the road at any given
time or day. Limitations can also be placed on the
number of new vehicles that can be registered in the
city. For example, both Beijing and Singapore use
a quota system. In Singapore, the Land Transport
Authority allocates quotas for each vehicle category
according to the current traffic conditions and the
number of vehicles taken off the roads permanently
(Table 7.4). The vehicle quota for a given year is
administered through the monthly release of ‘certificates of entitlement’ and the certificates are allocated

Box 7.6 Promoting sustainable transport solutions in Eastern African cities
The ‘Sustainable Transport Solutions in East African Cities’
project (SUSTRAN) aims to reduce growth in private
motorized vehicles, thus reducing traffic congestion and
greenhouse gas emissions in the cities of Addis Ababa
(Ethiopia), Kampala (Uganda) and Nairobi (Kenya). The project
– which is implemented by UN-Habitat in collaboration with
UNEP with financial support from the Global Environment
Facility – includes support for the design and implementation
of transport corridors featuring BRT, non-motorized

transport and travel demand management measures. It also
supports regional capacity building, including city-to-city
learning. While collaborating with local metropolitan and
transport authorities, the project has promoted the active
involvement of current transport operators and other
stakeholders. By 2035, it is projected that this initiative will
have led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions amounting
to more than 2.5 million tonnes.

through an auction.81 In Bogotá, Colombia, the pico
y placa (Box 7.7) limits the numbers of vehicles on
the road on a given day by allowing odd and even
number plates to be used on alternative days.82
However, this latter type of measure may encourage
higher income-residents to buy a second car, often
with an older, less efficient engine (thus leading to
increased emissions).
Parking regulations are important as this relates
to the allocation of space in cities by price and time
of day, and it covers both on-street and off-street
locations (Box 8.5). As part of the congestion charging
scheme in London, UK (introduced in 2003), parking
availability was reassessed both within the pricing area
(to reduce it) and outside the area to encourage commuters to leave their cars at home.83 Many cities have
also introduced park-and-ride schemes where drivers
leave their cars at the periphery and continue their
journeys into the centre by public transport. A recent
survey of 45 schemes in Europe found rather uneven
implementation, but where deployment had taken
place there was strong public support, as traffic levels
and levels of pollution had been reduced.84

Pricing measures include electronic road
pricing (Singapore), congestion charging or cordon
pricing (London, UK, and Stockholm, Sweden),85
and parking pricing to reflect the value of the space
used. But very few cities have introduced pricing as
a mechanism to limit the numbers of cars coming
into the central area, and even in those cities that
have introduced schemes, it has only covered a small
part of the city. In addition, fuel prices are often
taxed, although the levels vary considerably from
country to country, as it relates both to the levels of
duty imposed and the additional national and local
taxes imposed.86 Some countries have tried to use
fuel duty escalators, so that the real price of petrol
and diesel increase over time to reflect the full
economic costs, but this has proved unpopular with
the oil industry, car manufacturers, as well as
motorists.87 All of these measures have primarily been
introduced to raise revenues88 and to address congestion issues, even though it has been acknowledged
that there are also environmental benefits.89
Public transport fare subsidies can have social
objectives in increasing the mobility of low-income

Box 7.7 TransMilenio: Supporting sustainable mobility in Bogotá, Colombia
The first two phases of the TransMilenio BRT system in
Bogotá, Colombia, were completed by 2003, and it has a total
of 84 kilometres of median busways, about 25 per cent of
which is completely segregated from other traffic. The final
phase (of another 100 kilometres, which was due to be
completed in 2012) has been delayed due to unresolved
political issues (including plans to construct a metro).
By 2011, the BRT system included some 1190 articulated
buses, 10 bi-articulated buses, 114 access stations (with
prepayment), 6 terminals and 4 intermediate integrated
stations. In addition there were 448 feeder buses, running on
61 feeder routes with 420 line-kilometres. TransMilenio is
frequently cited as a ‘good practice’ BRT project, and it carries
some 1.7 million passengers per weekday, with 43,000 passengers moving each hour in one direction. The uniqueness of
Bogotá’s system is the ‘transformation of a busway corridor
with severe pollution, safety problems and aesthetically
displeasing into a new BRT system with significantly lower
travel times, lower noise and fewer greenhouse gas
emissions’.a
By drastically reducing existing travel times and acting on
the radial corridors connecting residential areas to the central
business district, TransMilenio has done much to reinforce the
attractiveness of the city centre. Public acceptance of the
project is over 70 per cent, but there have been complaints
about overcrowding and the time taken for interchange from
the feeder lines. Furthermore, many people still lack access to
the system as the network does not extend to the locations
where the poor are living. In 2005, the population located in
the more remote parts of the city accounted for 65 per cent
of the total population, as the land there was cheaper and thus

more affordable for low-income people. In fact, land-use value
increases around the TransMilenio corridors have been
estimated to be close to 20 per cent.
While the TransMilenio system has played an important
role in contributing to more sustainable mobility system in
Bogotá, it is worth noting that it was introduced as part of
wider policy package, which also included the following
components:
•

•

•

•

•

Development of 285,500 square metres of walkways,
green spaces, road dividers, sidewalks and shaded
promenades, with 11 metropolitan parks, 3149 neighbourhood parks and 323 smaller scale parks.
Construction of 350 kilometres of bikeways contributed
to an increase in bicycle use from 1 per cent in 1995 to
7 per cent in 2010, when there were a total of 1498 bike
parking locations.
In addition, the introduction of the ciclovia system implies
that some 120 kilometres of main roads are closed to
motor vehicles for seven hours every Sunday, so that
streets can be used by people for walking, cycling, jogging
and meeting each other.
Peak and license plate (pico y placa) restrictions during
peak hours (6–9 am and 4–7 pm) using plate numbers for
40 per cent of the private cars.
Fees and taxes: 20 per cent petrol surcharge (revenue
allocated to public transport infrastructure and road
maintenance) and car-free weekday in February (approved
by popular vote).

households, but it is important that such subsidy
goes to the identified user. It is also important to
make sure that the quality of the public transport
fleet is maintained at a high environmental standard,
and that operators are given an incentive to invest.
But subsidies have much wider impacts on livelihoods, as illustrated by a study of public transport
in Sub-Saharan Africa:
‘Subsidies and other forms of compensation can
help formal public transport but an integrated
framework and a level playing field are also
needed for all types of transport to flourish.
Financial mechanisms should be put in place to
support the system, integrating the different
types of collective transport rather than allowing
profits to be scooped up by the informal sector
with no regard for the burden of costs they might
place on local governments and society as a
whole. This can include trust funds, better credit
facilities, land-value capture and other sources
of revenues that can be used to help build
sustainable low-carbon transport systems that
will allow Africa to flourish and develop
economically.’ 90
As noted above, subsidization is a form of
incentive to encourage people to change their
behaviour, and it can also apply to cars. For example,
incentives can be given to encourage the purchase
of more efficient cars and electric vehicles, where
purchase prices are subsidized, or where preferential
parking is given, or exemption from paying the
congestion charge is given. All three of these
incentives have been introduced in the UK.91
Investment in public transport and public
transport infrastructure are both central to make
sure that priority is given to this transport mode, as
it allows the greatest number of people to be carried
most efficiently. Public transport has to share space
on congested roads with other traffic, and this reduces its efficiency. Trams have provided one effective means to introduce ‘clean’ transport that has a
clear priority through control (traffic signals) and
exclusive tracks.92
More recently, BRT is seen as a flexible and
cheap means to invest in high-quality public transport with a separate right of way.93 As discussed in
Chapter 3, BRT potentially offers a high-capacity,
relatively inexpensive and flexible form of public
transport in many cities. BRT systems have good environmental credentials and can be introduced in a
variety of different forms. Box 7.7 looks at how BRT
can be combined into part of an integrated set of
measures that have the potential to change perceptions of public transport.

141

TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION AND VEHICLE
EFFICIENCY
This section presents technological and other policy
responses related to increasing the efficiency of
motorized vehicles and the use of the best available
technology. This implies that the use of carbonbased fuels should be substantially reduced and
cleaner low-carbon fuels should replace them for all
forms of motorized transport (freight and passenger).
As noted earlier in this chapter, the amount of CO2
produced by motorized vehicles is directly related to
the amount of fuel used, and there is considerable
potential for reductions.94
However, it should be remembered that efficiency gains must be set against the growth in
traffic,95 as this often outweighs those gains. The
discussion below focuses on four main issues, namely:
the efficiency and age of the vehicle stock, standards
of fuels used in vehicles, the potential of alternative
fuels, and vehicle occupancy.
It is here important to note that there is a
substantial potential for technological ‘leapfrogging’.
Thus there is no reason why cities in developing
countries have to follow the same high-motorization
(and high-pollution) pathway as that followed in
developed countries. Rapid urbanization in many
developing countries thus presents an opportunity
to invest in the low-carbon city transport system of
the future. That having been said, it is important to
note that this cannot be undertaken without substantial financial support from the developed countries. This means that effective mechanisms need to
be established, such as the fuel security credits being
tested by the Asian Development Bank,96 or initiatives
under the clean development mechanism of the
Kyoto Protocol.97

Efficiency and age of the vehicle stock
The scale of any emission reduction is dependent on
a set of factors such as the efficiency and turnover
rate of the vehicle stock, the distance driven by each
vehicle, and the tendency to buy larger and heavier
vehicles. New vehicle technology has reduced the
fuel use per unit of power by 50 per cent over a 15
year period (1990–2005), yet most of that potential
saving has been negated by the overall increase in
power and weight, particularly in the US. Thus the
net effect has been no change.98
The introduction of new technologies does not,
however, lead to immediate cuts in emissions. The
efficiency of any single vehicle on the road is always
lower than that of the newest technology. In general,
this implies that overall emissions depend on the
average age of the vehicle fleet in any particular
country (or city). And, in the countries with the oldest

vehicle fleets, maintenance becomes a central issue.
In general, the average age of vehicles in developed
countries is lower than in developing countries,
where the average age of vehicles can be more than
15 years99 (Figure 7.4). There are some exceptions
however, such as Brazil, which is one of the few developing countries with its own car manufacturing
industry.100 Some of the vehicles in developing
countries operate for more than 40 years. These older
vehicles are responsible for a disproportionately high
percentage of air pollution, despite their relatively
low numbers:
‘The main reasons for the persistence of old
technology include the high cost of new vehicles,
the relatively low maintenance and support cost
for older technology, and a lack of government
fleet renewal incentives (including inspection
and maintenance regimes).’101
However, there are examples, even from developing countries of successful schemes of upgrading the vehicle fleet. In Cairo, Egypt, for example,
the government has initiated a scheme to renew
the taxi fleet. The project started in 2007 with
the introduction of 100 new air-conditioned (and
metered) taxis, fuelled by CNG. In 2009, through a
joint scheme with five car companies, three banks,
advertising agencies (who were given the right to
place advertisements on the taxis) and owners of
scrapping yards, the scheme was launched at full
scale. By 2013, a total of 43,000 old taxis had been
replaced.102
Most developing and transitional countries –
with the major exceptions being Brazil, India and
China – do not have their own car manufacturing
industry. The majority of developing countries are
thus relying on imported vehicles. And, due to the

cost of new vehicles, many of the imported vehicles
are second-hand. In effect, developed countries are
exporting their less efficient and more polluting
vehicles to developing countries. Over the period
2005–2008, for example, 2.45 million vehicles were
imported to Mexico from the US and Canada (with
an average age of 11.4 years). The vehicles exported
from the US to Mexico had higher emissions levels
of hydrocarbons (4 per cent higher), carbon monoxide
(4 per cent higher) and nitrogen dioxide (22 per cent
higher) than the average vehicle in the US. Yet, the
emissions of these vehicles were still lower than that
of the existing fleet in Mexico.103
In order to address the issue of this ‘dumping’
of polluting vehicles, a number of countries have
introduced technology- or age-restrictions on imported vehicles. In Kenya, for example, only models
that are eight years old or less can be imported.104
In Belarus, the government discourages the import
of older cars through high import duties.105

Standards of fuels used and emissions
from vehicles
The emission of pollutants from motorized vehicles
is related to three main factors: the quality of the
fuel, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle stock and the
capture of pollutants before they escape from the
vehicle. These are discussed in more detail below.
Considerable progress is being made in
improving the quality of fuel used and the efficiency
of the conventional petrol and diesel internal
combustion engine, so that the typical car is now
some 35 per cent more efficient than it was ten years
ago. This improvement can be directly translated into
reductions in CO2 emissions.106 The EU has introduced legislation (2009) for a reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels by up to 10 per cent by

Urban Mobility and the Environment

2020 – a ‘low carbon fuel standard’. This will be
achieved through the greater use of renewable energy
in electric vehicles, and the use of biomass sources,
such as bio ethanol that is already mixed with fuel
(5 per cent).107
Even though diesel vehicles produce less CO2
per unit of distance travelled, their increasing
dominance in the vehicle fleet (both passenger and
freight) has been negated by the greater distances
travelled. Diesel vehicles also tend to have larger
emissions of other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides
and particulate matter (Box 7.2). As a result, the
WHO has recently stated that diesel exhaust causes
cancer, and has called for tighter emission standards,
comparing the risk of exhaust to second-hand
cigarette smoke.108
In India, the fuel quality standards for transport
fuels are legislated under the environmental
Protection Act (which follows the EU specifications).
New specifications have been introduced in two
phases, first applied in 13 major cities109 and then
followed by nationwide implementation. India has
used unleaded petrol nationwide since 2000.110
Reductions in the sulphur levels in diesel have
major effects on emissions, as many developing countries have very high sulphur levels111 in
diesel fuels. Reducing sulphur to very low levels112
also reduces the emissions of particulate matter, and
it enables emission control technologies that provide
even greater emission reductions (i.e. diesel oxidation
catalysts and diesel particulate filters).113 For petrol
vehicles, low sulphur levels114 in fuel improve the
performance of catalytic converter systems that are
standard in developed countries. Low sulphur levels
are now being introduced in most developing
countries as well, through the importation of new
and second-hand cars.115
Governments are increasingly looking towards
vehicle manufacturers to improve the fuel efficiency

of the vehicle stock. Many governments are now
setting more challenging mandatory targets for fuel
efficiency in new vehicles, and this single action will
substantially reduce CO2 and other emissions from
the transport sector.116 The EU tried, unsuccessfully,
to introduce voluntary agreements with the vehicle
manufacturers during the last decade. It is only
recently (2009) that mandatory targets have been set.
However, the fact that good progress has already been
made towards these targets may suggest that the
targets are not tough enough. Figure 7.5 shows that
there is a clear downward trend in the emissions of
CO2 from new vehicles and the fleet-wide mandatory
targets set by the EU will be a benchmark for other
manufacturers.
Many pollutants can be filtered out through
the use of catalytic converters, particulate traps and
other technologies, although this means that additional costs are imposed on vehicle owners. It is,
however, also important to ensure that the filters are
working effectively, and this again relates to regular
maintenance and testing of vehicles. Catalytic
converters do not work when engines are cold, and
so for many short journeys the pollutants are not
being filtered out. Regulations in Europe have
gradually been tightened up so that emissions levels
for all vehicles (including freight vehicles) conform
to EU standards.117 These standards are also being
adopted elsewhere, for example in Russia118 and
China.119 The US and Japan have their own emissions
standards that have been tougher than those in the
EU until 2000, but all three have since followed
essentially the same path and are converging towards
zero emissions for all pollutants.
Due to the fact that the emission standards only
apply to new vehicles, it takes a considerable time
before their full benefits are realized, as existing older
vehicles have to be scrapped and replaced by new
vehicles.120 Despite the clear intentions to reduce

key emissions from vehicles, in practice it will take
10–15 years to work its way through the entire
vehicle stock in developed countries. In developing
countries, with their considerably older vehicle stock
it will take even longer.
Add-on technology (principally the catalytic
converter), cleaner fuels and more efficient and
lighter vehicles have helped reduce the levels of
pollutants from petrol engine vehicles by 80 per cent.
There are, however, questions about whether the
technology is working efficiently and the rate of
change in the existing vehicle fleet, particularly in
those cities with the most rapid increase in levels of
car ownership. Furthermore, there are still concerns
over whether the same levels of air quality improvement can be achieved in diesel vehicles.121 And, the
problem of particulates is still present as this results
from fuels (diesel), from tyres and from other sources,
and this is much harder to control (and is a particular
problem for freight trucks in urban areas).
The belief that add-on technology can ‘solve’
the air quality issue is too simple. As noted above,
there are important limitations relating to whether
the catalytic converters are working, whether diesel
emissions can be controlled effectively, the time
taken for all vehicles to be fitted, and the slow
switch to alternative fuels. When set against the
growth in car ownership and use, the catalytic converter really only gives a maximum of ten years
‘breathing space’ before pollution levels start to rise
again. In the US, for example, the catalytic converter
has been compulsory since 1979, and the full benefits
have already worked their way into the entire car
fleet. The CO2 problem has not been addressed, as
reduction in fuel use is the only means to reduce
such emissions.122

Alternative fuels

The most positive
developments
have come from
hybrid vehicles
that combine
conventional
internal
combustion
engine with
electric vehicle
technology

In order to reduce the dependence on oil – and to
reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other
pollutants – there has been much debate over the
introduction of alternative fuels in the transport
sector. However, while searching for alternatives, it
is important to keep in mind the fact that both
petrol and diesel have very high energy densities,123
and that there have already been substantial
investments in support infrastructure in most
countries (e.g. fuel stations). Thus, alternatives need
to have a high energy output and they must be
produced cleanly and cheaply, and in sufficient
quantities.
In the near future, it is unlikely that any
alternative fuel can replace the established oil-based
sources of fuel, as they cannot be produced (or
distributed) in the quantities required. This means
that all alternative fuels are likely to be niche markets.
However, these may in turn develop to mass-market
options in the longer term. In situations where there

is less established supporting infrastructure (e.g. in
developing countries), the introduction of new fuels
may happen earlier. This provides an opportunity to
initiate new solutions to urban motorization in developing countries. This is already evident in some
countries through the use of BRT and electric vehicles
(including e-bikes).
In terms of policy, the EU seeks to halve the
use of conventionally fuelled cars by 2030, to phase
such cars out of cities by 2050, and to achieve
carbon-free goods movement in cities by 2030. The
EU believes that technological innovation will play a
major role in this process, combined with regulations
and standards being set by individual governments,
demand management, road pricing and local city-level
controls.124
The public discussion related to alternative fuels
started with a focus on greater efficiency within
existing internal combustion engines. As discussed
above, efficiency levels have improved substantially,
and a further halving of CO2 emissions is expected
over the next ten years (Figure 7.5). Public debate
has since moved onto biofuels and hydrogen.
However, the potential of biofuels has been restricted
by the conflicts arising from increasing food prices,
as increasing production of energy crops has led to
reduced areas of agricultural land producing food
crops.125 The production of liquid fuels from sugar,
biomass and cellulose also requires huge amounts of
water. Likewise, the potential of hydrogen as a clean
fuel has been questioned because of the energy
required in its production (often from carbon
products, such as oil or coal), and because of issues
related to the storage and distribution of the
hydrogen.126
More recently, the electric vehicle has emerged
as a more suitable alternative for urban transport.
Such vehicles include hybrid electric vehicles, plugin hybrid electric vehicles127 and other electric
vehicles (including battery-driven vehicles). Increased
use of such vehicles would solve many of the local
pollution problems. However, the energy still has to
be generated (often from coal), and there are issues
relating to the recharging infrastructure, the use of
materials and the need for a lifecycle approach to
energy use and emissions.128
The most positive developments have come
from hybrid vehicles that combine conventional
internal combustion engine with electric vehicle
technology, as this allows both electric power at low
speeds and a combination of internal combustion
engine and electric power at higher speeds. In such
hybrid vehicles, the conventional engine is supported
by a battery that can be recharged while the vehicle
is being used. Greenhouse gases and other pollutants
are still being emitted, but these vehicles provide a
direct substitute for the conventional car, but use
only about 60 per cent of the fuel. Over the lifetime
of the car it is likely that there are cost savings to

Box 7.8 Sustainable transport in Hangzhou, China
The city of Hangzhou (population 8.1 million in 2009) seeks to
build a highly integrated and low-carbon intensive transport
network that consists of metro, BRT, cycle and walking, water
transport and electric vehicles. A key element of this strategy
is the world’s largest public bicycle programme. In 2009, some
67 per cent of all trips were by foot, cycle and electric bike.
This accounted for 9.6 million out of 14.4 million trips made
each day – the CO2 emissions per trip are 250 grammes
(about a third of the level in London). The sustainable transport strategy includes the following elements:
•
•
•
•

A metro system of 69 kilometres (2011), to be extended
to 278 kilometres by 2050.
Nine BRT routes, with a further ten planned for 2020.
Smart card operated systems for buses, taxis, bicycles and
other forms of public transport.
Seamless connections and zero interchange strategies for
public transport transfers.

the user, as the higher purchase prices are compensated for by lower fuel costs.
China has introduced a series of policies aiming
to facilitate electric vehicle industrialization and
commercialization, including pilot projects, standard announcements and purchase subsidies. In
the industrial sector, a group of car manufacturers
has announced mass production plans for electric
vehicles.129 In some cities, electric vehicles are beginning to make a significant impact in terms of their
share of public transport and public service vehicle
fleets. This includes delivery vehicles, buses and
other services (e.g. taxis). In June 2010, six cities
were chosen to implement electric vehicle purchase
subsidies with a maximum of US$9000 per vehicle
in the private car market.130 One of these ‘electric’
transport cities is Hangzhou, where a variety of
measures have been combined to achieve an innovative and environmentally beneficial transport
pathway (Box 7.8).

Subsidy for electric cars up to US$18,000 or about 50 per
cent of purchase price and free charging initially.
Four electric vehicle charging stations, 38 sub charging and
battery swap stations and 3500 charging posts by 2012.
Plans for 1100 electric vehicles to be used by the public
sector, and electric buses and taxis are being tested.
Electric bikes are cheap and flexible, costing US$150–300.
The running costs are 2 per cent of those of a car,
averaging at US$2.25 per 100 kilometres. In 2007 there
were 600,000 electric bikes in Hangzhou.

Although, worldwide, most attention has been
given to technological innovation for the private car,
there is also considerable potential within cities to
use electric power and hybrid technologies for public
and freight transport. London, UK, for example, had
more than 300 hybrid buses in operation by December 2012,131 and similar initiatives are currently
underway in Latin America (Box 7.9). Electric trucks
have been used for local deliveries (Box 7.4) and
hybrid vehicles have become more commonly used
by global companies (Box 7.10). These vehicles are
intensively used, and they can be recharged and
maintained at the company’s own sites.

The range of technological solutions that can be used
to address the issues of improved vehicle efficiencies
and reduced levels of CO2 emissions are extensive.
However, technology cannot provide the whole

Box 7.9 The Hybrid and Electric Bus Test Programme, Latin America
The Hybrid and Electric Bus Test Programme was launched in
June 2011 by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group in
partnership with the Clinton Climate Initiative. In five
participating cities – Bogotá, Curitiba, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago
de Chile and São Paulo – the programme seeks to reduce the
carbon footprint of public transportation and develop a
market for fuel-efficient, low-carbon buses in Latin America.
Supported by the Inter-American Development Bank,
the programme brings together cities, bus technology
companies and local transport operators to test bus
technology performance in city-specific driving conditions and
duty cycles. Ultimately, the programme aims to catalyse the

deployment of up to 9000 buses across Latin American cities
over the next five years, with annual CO2 emission reductions
of 475,000 tonnes.
The programme compares hybrid diesel-electric
technology and conventional diesel technology. Promising
findings show that hybrid technology is at least 32 per cent
more fuel efficient and produces fewer local air pollutants and
greenhouse gases than conventional diesel buses; while electric
buses have zero on-road emissions and are 250 per cent more
fuel efficient than normal diesel buses.

Box 7.10 Hybrid trucks
A number of global delivery companies (FedEx, DHL, TNT and UPS) have tested
hybrid delivery trucks and these are slowly beginning to be introduced into their fleets.
FedEx together with Eaton Corporation have developed a diesel hybrid electric vehicle
delivery truck and launched a pilot project with 20 hybrid electric vehicle diesel trucks
(in 2004). The Eaton truck is a medium weight pick-up delivery truck that operates in
urban areas with many short stops for collection and delivery. By 2009 FedEx had a
fleet of 264 hybrid electric trucks, and they have covered more than 4 million miles of
service (2004–2009), reducing fuel use by more than 570,000 litres and CO2 emissions
by 1521 metric tonnes.

THE COMPOSITE
SOLUTION
solution to the environmental impacts of urban
mobility. Improved vehicle standards, better fuels,
alternative fuels and innovation can all make an
important contribution, but effective policy actions
here need to be combined with strategies to reduce
the need to travel, the distances travelled and the
modes of transport used (see below).
Underlying all strategies, however, is the
importance of vehicle occupancy (freight and passenger), and the efficiency figures illustrate the importance of occupancy (or load) (Box 7.11). Fully laden
vehicles (public and private, freight and passenger)
are far more efficient than empty ones. This also
reduces environmental impacts, improves the quality
of the urban area and contributes to reducing
congestion.
‘High-occupancy vehicle’ lanes or car-pool lanes
have been introduced in some cities (primarily in
developed countries) to increase vehicle occupancies. Vehicles that travel in a high-occupancy vehicle
lane must carry at least one (sometimes two) passengers in addition to the driver. Some high-occupancy
vehicle lanes are in operation only during certain
hours. Outside of those hours, they may be used by
all vehicles.132 High-occupancy vehicle lanes have
also been introduced in some developing coun-

load of the vehicle:

tries. On such example is South Africa where such
lanes have been introduced to facilitate bus transport in particular.133 According to critics, however,
few buses are using these lanes – primarily because
the lanes are on the wrong side of the road with
respect to loading and off-loading of passengers,
forcing buses to constantly change lanes – and, due
to lack of controls, these lanes are now used primarily
by private cars.134

In Amsterdam (the Netherlands), a truck may make deliveries in limited access
zones if it meets the following four conditions: it must be less than eight years old,
meet the Euro II standard, have a maximum length of 10 metres, and load or
unload at least 80 per cent of its merchandise in the central city.
In London, the Low Emission Zone (set up in 2008) prohibits trucks older than the
Euro III standard to enter the metropolitan area (the area surrounded by the M25
highway, totalling 1580 square kilometres).
In Tokyo, since 2003, the most polluting diesel vehicles have been prohibited from
the city centre.

The preceding sections have presented a number of
examples of interventions to enhance environmentally sustainable urban mobility systems. Each
of the examples has illustrated the impact of specific
types of policies. In most cases of successful implementation, however, it is not a single policy that has
been introduced – but rather a package of measures.
Such ‘packages’ are more likely to gain public
acceptance, and they allow a mixture of policies that
may be seen as disadvantageous to individual users,
but promote overall welfare gains to society (see for
example Box 7.7). Yet, while policy packaging can
certainly support effective and efficient policy-making
(not least through enhancing interventions’ implementation and the ex-ante mitigation of unintended
effects), the packaging process requires a deep and
holistic appreciation of policy subsystems, together
with a structured approach, if its benefits are to be
genuinely realized.135
To promote the environmental argument it is
important to consider a wide range of effects that
contribute co-benefits. For example, health can be
viewed in three main ways, as less motorized traffic
or ‘cleaner’ vehicles improve local air quality, as
slower travel leads to improvements in road safety
and as non-motorized transport has direct health
benefits. In addition, these improvements are likely
to have a positive effect on climate change through
reductions in CO2 emissions. All these factors lead
to important co-benefits that need to be included in
all environmental evaluation.
In order to achieve the EU 2050 target of zero
carbon emissions from transport in cities136 some
communities have started moving towards the ‘carfree city’. One such community is Vauban (in
Freiburg, Germany). It was constructed on a scale
that facilitates movement by local public transport,
walking and cycling (Box 7.12). Vauban offers one
example of how many of the different elements
outlined in this chapter can be brought together into
a coherent set of proposals. Based on this experience
it seems that urban residents can live in a car-free
environment, provided that: the right transport links
are established (i.e. to the main station and the city

Box 7.12 Car-free living: Vauban, Germany
Vauban is a small community of 5500 inhabitants and 600 jobs, 4 kilometres
south of the town centre of Freiburg (Germany). It was started in 1998 as ‘a
sustainable model district’ on the site of a former military base. Although
the Vauban community itself is small, it is mixed with considerable levels of
involvement of the local people in helping to decide priorities and
alternatives (the Forum Vauban). The guiding mobility principle has been to
try to reduce the use of the car, but giving residents the flexibility to use a
car where necessary. This is matched by high-quality public transport,
walking and cycling facilities.
Within Vauban, movement is mainly by foot and bicycle, and there is a
tram link to Freiburg (2006). Cycling is the main mode of transport for most
trips and most activities, including commuting and shopping. The town is laid
out linearly along the tracks so that all homes are within easy walking
distance of a tram stop. The speed limit on the district’s main road is 30
kilometres per hour, while in the residential area cars should not drive
faster than ‘walking speed’ (5 kilometres per hour). About 70 per cent of
the households have chosen to live without a private car (2009), and the
level of car ownership (and use) has continued to fall. In the past, more than
half of all households owned a car, and among those who are now living car
free, 81 per cent had previously owned one and 57 per cent gave up their
cars on or immediately after moving to Vauban.
The transport network in Vauban adopts a complex combination grid,
with three types of streets: collector roads, local streets and
pedestrian/bicycle paths. As indicated in the drawing, most local streets are
crescents and cul-de-sacs. While they are discontinuous for cars, they
connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths that permeate the entire
neighbourhood. In addition, these paths go through or by open spaces
adding to the enjoyment of the trip.
Furthermore, most of Vauban’s residential streets lack parking spaces.
Vehicles are allowed to drive in these streets (at walking pace) to pick up
and to deliver, but are not allowed to park, and enforcement is based on
social consensus. Each year, households are required to sign a declaration
indicating whether they own a car. If they do, they must buy a space in one

centre of Freiburg); there are local facilities and
services; and there are sufficient reasons for not
owning a car (e.g. limited and costly parking).
Similarly, in order to improve public transport,
a series of policy interventions are necessary to
create a positive overall experience. This includes
investments in new infrastructure (including vehicles,
routes and maintenance), electronic ticketing (smart
cards), 24-hour availability and the feeling of safety
and security. Another essential requirement is
organizational change that allows seamless travel
and short interchanges between modes (including
both route and fare integration). Furthermore,
high levels of public transport occupancy137 and use
permits, lower fares and extensive networks for all
users are central to sustainable urban mobility. All
these factors increase the efficiency of transport in
the city, and in turn result in environmental and other
co-benefits (e.g. safety, health and noise). Complementary actions include the slowing down of urban

of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery (at an annual cost of €18,000
in 2008).
The implementation of the traffic concept in Vauban meant that new
laws were needed to accommodate the current building regulations in the
federal state of Baden-Württemberg. The Association for Car-free Living in
Vauban (Verein für autofreies Wohnen) was founded as a legal body for the
implementation of the concept. For those that want the occasional use of a
car, the car sharing company Freiburger Auto Gemeinschaft offers cars for
occasional use by residents of Vauban, and they are parked in the
community car park. Those in the car-sharing scheme have access to the
shared cars and they also receive a one-year free pass for all public
transportation within Freiburg, as well as a 50 per cent reduction on every
train ticket for one year.

traffic, the allocation of space to public transport,
strong parking controls and road pricing. All of these
interventions are likely to maximize the use of public
transport.
In addition to prioritizing public transport,
investment in separate cycle and pedestrian networks
would strengthen the commitment to promoting
non-motorized transport. The available transport
space in the city should be determined and allocated
based on prioritization of low-carbon transport,
demand management and the identification of priority
users (and uses). However, it is important to keep
in mind that measures to encourage modal shift
must be combined with strategies to make the best
use of the ‘released space’ so that there is a net
reduction in motorized traffic.138 Such an approach
introduces the much wider notion of the street, as
road space is no longer considered only as a road but
as a space for people, green modes and public
transport. Creative use of that space at different times

not appropriate
for the transport
sector, and a
separate sectorbased mechanism
may be required

of the day or days of the week means that new uses
can be encouraged (e.g. street markets and play
zones).
The experience of GlaxoSmithKline, one of the
largest pharmaceutical companies in the world,
exemplifies how private-sector companies can reduce
their greenhouse gas emissions, and thus contribute
to more environmentally sustainable urban transport.
The fact that such initiatives are also of financial
benefit to the company should provide additional
encouragement for other companies to reduce some
of the negative environmental externalities of their
operations. Table 7.5 outlines measures implemented
by GlaxoSmithKline in 2010 with respect to the
company’s freight and employee transport. However,
more recent data indicate that the company’s total
transport emissions grew by 8.4 per cent in 2011,
thus cancelling out the gains made in 2010.139

FUNDING MECHANISMS
FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY
SUSTAINABLE URBAN
MOBILITY SYSTEMS
While Chapter 8 contains a more elaborate discussion of funding for urban transport investments, it
is appropriate here to make a brief reference to global
financial options that are directly related to environmental sustainability. So far, the mechanisms devised
to address such funding have not been effectively
used in cities or in the transport sector. Out of
the 6660 clean development mechanism projects
registered by 1 April 2013, only 28 were related to
transport.140 Another ten projects were under validation, or in the process of being registered.141 The
clean development mechanism is one of the three
flexible mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. The
clean development mechanism enables the implementation of emissions reduction projects in developing countries to earn ‘carbon credits’, which can
then be sold internationally (thus being rewarded

for having reduced emissions). By purchasing such
carbon credits, developed countries can meet parts
of their emissions reduction targets (by paying for
the right to pollute).142
Unfortunately, such carbon emissions trading
favours the cheaper projects, which may not have the
greatest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the longer period. Most transport projects
are expensive as they require up-front investment
or the development of new fuels and technologies.
Apart from the scale of change needed in the transport sector, the emissions are diffuse and hard to
measure, as is the reliable baseline and the need
to define project boundaries so that a consistent
monitoring framework can be established. Thus, the
existing carbon market is not appropriate for the
transport sector, and a separate sector-based mechanism may be required.
Alternatively, there could be a greater role
allocated to cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in transport and to adopt national appropriate
mitigation actions143 for city-scale application. Certainly, there is a strong case to integrate existing
funding mechanisms available for climate change
mitigation – such as the Global Environment Facility
(GEF),144 the environmental fiscal reform145 and
official development assistance – in the clean development mechanism.146
Furthermore, there may be considerable potential for emerging cities and countries to follow a less
carbon-intensive pathway when it comes to transport. The Sustainable Fuel Partnership,147 for example, is examining the rationale behind a new market
mechanism to provide energy incentives for improving energy security in the Asia-Pacific region by
treating energy security as a public good that can be
valued and translated into a cash flow, and thereby
to correct market inefficiencies. This will be achieved
through ‘fuel security credits’ that are designed to
reduce actual oil use and to invest in transport
projects that are less energy intensive, to examine
means by which trips can be avoided, to encourage
mode shift to public and non-motorized transport,
and to improve technologies.148

There are also considerable overlaps between
many general development programmes – funded
through official development assistance – and global
public goods programmes, including climate change
mitigations strategies such as public-sector investments in clean transportation.149 Furthermore,
although it is currently not mentioned specifically, there should be considerable scope to include
funding for sustainable urban mobility – particularly in developing countries – in the discussions on
innovative development financing mechanisms
currently being explored in the global economic
arena.150 Thus, both of these sources of funding could
be drawn upon to finance environmentally sustainable urban mobility systems.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
When sensitively planned and appropriately supported by sustainable infrastructure, compact cities
are the world’s most efficient settlement pattern.
Urban density reduces the overall spatial footprint
of development and allows for greater preservation
of natural areas. It also allows for more efficient use
of transport infrastructure, which reduces emissions
and resource use. However, current trends in motorization and oil dependence – and the increased
dependence on private motorized transport – pose
major challenges to the development of environmentally sustainable urban mobility systems, namely:
• greenhouse gas emissions: the main cause of
global climate change, which could have catastrophic impacts on urban transportation systems;
• urban sprawl: leading to increasing trip lengths
and thus increased dependence on the private car
to meet individual mobility needs;
• air and noise pollution, and decreased physical
activity: have major negative impacts on the health
of urban residents;
• road traffic accidents: are among the leading
causes of premature deaths in cities all around the
world;
• community severance: where major transport
infrastructure disrupts neighbourhoods and serves
as physical barriers to human interaction.
To address these challenges, there is a need for policy
interventions that encourage change in five major
areas, namely: a reduction of the number of motorized trips made (i.e. telecommuting, online shopping
or a shift to non-motorized transport); reduced travel
distances in cities (i.e. changes to the urban form);
changes in the modal split (i.e. encouraging public
transport); technological innovations that reduce the
negative externalities of motorized transport (i.e.

more efficient fuels and reduced emissions); and
increased vehicle efficiency (i.e. higher occupancy
rates).
Most policy interventions may be grouped in
three categories: regulatory measures; pricing
measures; and investments in public transport and
public (and non-motorized) transport infrastructure.
Regulatory measures may be used to limit the number of cars on the roads at any particular time, or to
restrict the number of parking places in inner-city
areas, both of which may encourage a modal shift
towards public transport. Such measures may also
be used to reduce emissions from motor vehicles to
encourage the use of more energy-efficient vehicles,
and to encourage more efficient use of infrastructure
and vehicles, for example through the introduction
of dedicated high-occupancy vehicle lanes.
Pricing measures may be used to discourage the
use of private motorized transport – in the form of
electronic road pricing, congestion charging, parking pricing, fuel taxes, etc. – or to encourage the use
of more energy-efficient vehicles – for example sales
duties related to engine size. Similarly, such measures
may also be used in the form of subsidies to encourage the use of public transport (fare subsidies) and
to encourage the purchase of more efficient vehicles
(subsidies on low-emission fuels, vehicle purchase
prices, exemptions from congestion or parking
charges, etc.).
Investments in public transport, and infrastructure for public and non-motorized transport, may also
play a major role in encouraging shifts to more sustainable modes of transport. Improved connectivity,
increased capacity, enhanced quality and reduced
travel times for such modes are major factors encouraging city residents to reduce their reliance on the
private car.
However, the perhaps most effective approach
(at least in the longer term) to reduce the environmental impact of urban mobility is to reconsider the
urban spatial structure. As discussed in Chapter 5,
urban form plays an important part in determining
both transport mode and distance travelled, as it links
the spatial distribution of population and jobs (as well
as other destinations) to the pattern of trips. Through
increased (population and job) densities and mixeduse developments, urban planning may play a major
role in organizing spatial activities in cities so that
they are in close proximity to their users. Wellplanned, densely populated settlements can reduce
the need for private motorization and decrease travel
distances, thus making it more attractive to walk and
cycle. Furthermore, urban planning based on transitoriented development (or similar approaches) helps
to maximize urban densities around transport nodes
and encourages a modal shift to public transport.
Such an integration of land-use and transport planning
is a core component of a strategy to create environmentally sustainable urban mobility systems.

There is a need
for policy
interventions that
encourage . . . :
a reduction of
the number of
motorized trips
made . . . ;
reduced travel
distances in cities
. . . ; changes in
the modal split
. . . ; technological
innovations that
reduce the
negative
externalities of
motorized
transport . . . ;
and increased
vehicle efficiency

The perhaps most
effective approach
. . . to reduce the
environmental
impact of urban
mobility is to
reconsider the
urban spatial
structure

To ensure
successful
implementation of
environmental
policies, . . .
public
acceptability
should be a major
concern

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

While the above interventions are discussed
separately in the report, it is essential to consider
them as components of a package of measures. Such
‘packages’ are more likely to be publicly acceptable,
as they allow a mixture of policies, some of which
may be seen as disadvantageous to individual users,
yet as a package they may be seen as supporting the
public good. To ensure successful implementation
of environmental policies, some of which may involve
radical change, public acceptability should be a major
concern. Communities and other stakeholders should
thus be involved in all phases of policy development,
including initial discussions, decision-making and
implementation.

The strategic planning of the city, and the role
played by transport systems, needs to be balanced
by actions taken at the neighbourhood level, in a
supportive government environment at all levels. It
is at the neighbourhood level that cycling and walking
become important modes of transport – for access
to employment and other services and facilities – and
these complement the need to travel longer distances
by public transport to other parts of the city. Citywide decisions need to take account of the
requirements of the population and businesses – i.e.
to ensure access to destinations – so that movement
can take place in an efficient and environmentally
sustainable manner.

CHAPTER

8

THE ECONOMICS AND FINANCING
OF URBAN MOBILITY
This chapter seeks to provide an understanding of
the economics and financial options that determine
the success or failure of urban mobility systems. Each
such system includes a range of mobility options, from
walking to rail-based metro systems. In economic
terms, the various modes of urban mobility are both
complementary and competitive. They are complementary because residents typically avail themselves
of more than one travel mode as they go about the
daily activities of urban life. At the same time these
modal alternatives often compete for passengers. If
better-coordinated and sustainable transport systems
are to evolve out of such complex systems, it is going
to require an understanding of the incentives and
disincentives faced by buyers and sellers of transport
services.
The ways that urban transport options emerge
and evolve depend heavily upon the costs of these
options and the ways in which these costs are
financed: either directly in fares, indirectly in taxes
and fees or absorbed as pollution, climate change,
congestion, road traffic deaths and injuries, or other
social costs. Thus, this chapter reviews the economics
and financing of urban mobility in light of its impacts
on the ways the choices are made to explicitly pay
for or implicitly absorb the costs.
In matters of urban transport economics, financial arrangements are always paramount. Finance
systems can encourage (or discourage) the alignment
of economic, environmental and social goals. Differentials in investments and operating funds among
modal alternatives have social, spatial, environmental
and equity impacts. These may be good or bad, as
the various modes compete for scarce urban space
and market shares. Whether by indecision or decision,
such choices are made continually, and thus outcomes in this regard are results of – and impact upon
– public policy.
To understand the financial dynamics, it is

necessary to understand the economic relationships
among and within urban travel modes. With the
exception of rail-based modes (which travel on
segregated rights of way) all other forms of urban
movement – from walking to motorized travel – rely
on access to a shared system of sidewalks, streets,
roads and highways. Thus, while different modes of
urban movement appear to be physically and financially independent of one another, they are nonetheless physically and financially interdependent
because of their shared (and usually competitive) use
of public infrastructure.
The improvement of urban mobility systems
requires strategic choices regarding the structures
through which the infrastructure and equipment
that service urban public transport are financed.
Public transport must be bolstered as both a viable
alternative to private cars (and motorcycles) and a
strong supportive and complementary supplement to
non-motorized mobility. As a result, there is a need
to address the incentives and disincentives built into
current financial configurations.
In order to address the issues outlined above,
the first section below presents a brief overview of
the conditions and trends that determine the
economics of urban mobility. This is followed by
discussions on the economic role of transport in the
functioning of an urban economy, and the need to
move away from economics of mobility towards
economics of access. The fourth section develops an
understanding of the systems of incentives and
disincentives built into the current methods used to
finance urban transport systems. Based on this
discussion, the fifth section proposes policies and
plans that permit urban transport to make a major
contribution to the realization of socially and environmentally sustainable cities, while the final section
contains some concluding remarks and lessons for
policy.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

THE ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL CHALLENGES
OF URBAN MOBILITY
Data on the
relationship
between rising
income levels and
rising rates of car
ownership are
strongly positive;
as income rises,
car ownership
increases.

The central
challenge is to
ensure that
financing for
public transport
and nonmotorized
transport
infrastructure and
service delivery is
at least
comparable to
efforts for
accommodating
the car

This section discusses the key economic characteristics of urban transport. It begins by examining
trends in private car ownership and use, since private
motorized transport is the least environmentally sustainable, most land-intensive modal option. It then
compares user costs and the cost to build and operate
various urban transport modes.

The global dominance of private
motorized transport
The global dominance of the private car as the
preferred means of urban transport is setting global
urbanization on a collision course with the world’s
pressing equity and environmental concerns.1 As
indicated in Chapter 2, the forecasts for the future
in terms of non-motorized and public transport are
not promising, if current car-ownership trends
continue.2
Data on the relationship between rising income
levels and rising rates of car ownership are strongly
positive; as income rises, car ownership increases.
Within countries, wealthier residents are much more
likely to own motor vehicles. For example, modal split
is closely correlated with socioeconomic groups in
Bogotá (Colombia) and Santiago (Chile). Seventy per
cent of the high-income group in Bogotá and 80 per
cent in Santiago use private cars compared with 70
and 60 per cent of low-income groups using public
transportation, respectively.3
In China, with only 44 passenger cars per 1000
people in 2010,4 estimates indicate that for every 1
per cent increase in average disposable income,

car ownership in Chinese cities is expected to
increase by 1.8 per cent.5 São Paulo is another
example of the trend; bus ridership declined by
nearly half (from 6.7 million to 3.8 million passengers per day) during the 1990s. At the same time,
car use and road congestion increased, and bus
speeds slowed from 19 to 12 kilometres per hour.6
Figure 8.1 illustrates the same relationship
globally by comparing per capita income and the
number of cars. Although the relationship between
income levels and car ownership is relatively weak
in countries with high incomes, it is strong among
low-income countries. As the majority of the world’s
population live in low-income countries, an overall
increase in income in these countries could have a
significant impact on car ownership.7
These data convey an ironic message: as living
standards in developing countries rise, their cities will
find themselves under ever-greater pressure to
accommodate private motorized transport, with all
its other negative side effects. Where economic
development policies are successful8 economic
growth will stimulate demands to acquire valuable
land for use as roads and parking spaces. The simple
reason for this is that given the contemporary state
of urban public transport, private motorized transport is almost universally considered to be the
superior alternative whenever people can afford the
choice.9 One result of this perception is the support
for transport finance policies that privilege expanded
street and road networks to accommodate expanded
reliance on car-based travel, while other options
languish.
Thus, from an economic point of view, the
central challenge is to ensure that financing for
public transport and non-motorized transport infrastructure and service delivery is at least comparable
to efforts for accommodating the car. To do less is

to virtually ensure that public transport remains an
inferior choice.

Economic characteristics by mode and
context
As noted in Chapter 2, non-freight transportation can
be divided into non-motorized transport (walking and
bicycling), public transport, informal motorized transport and private motorized transport. Each of these
modes has different economic characteristics, which
largely depend on contextual features, such as city
size and density, geography, demographics, institutional framework and history.
In many cities, there is a wide gap between
modal use, infrastructure allocation and modal
funding. That is, a large share of the population uses
non-motorized or public transport, while a disproportionate amount of infrastructure and funding
supports private motorized transport. For example,
in Dhaka, Bangladesh, almost 80 per cent of trips are
by walking, bus or informal motorized transport, yet
70 per cent of the road space is dedicated primarily
to private vehicles.10 In some Eastern African cities,
walking accounts for more than half of all trips
but less than 1 per cent of total costs, while accommodating private vehicles incurs 50 per cent of total
system costs.11 This section presents an overview
comparing the economics of the various modes in a
variety of contexts.

lanes. They also cost the least for users who expend
only calories and can use relatively inexpensive
bicycles. In many developing country cities, nonmotorized transport is thus the predominant modal
choice.12
Despite its relatively low cost, infrastructure for
non-motorized transport (pedestrian bridges, paths,
sidewalks and crossings) is sorely lacking in many
urban areas, making it a relatively unsafe and often
inconvenient mode of travel.13 Financing for such
infrastructure is usually limited to central government funds, yet the historic nature of urban transportation policy has a distinct bias towards motor
vehicles. This has resulted in non-motorized transport being completely ignored or allocated an
insufficient budget. This is a paradox, as most trips
contain at least one segment of walking.14 The main
factor related to the lack of financing of non-motorized transport facilities in cities of developing
countries is that they are not ‘revenue generating’
and, hence, private investors and international lending agencies are not keen to provide finance, while
the cost is, in many cases, beyond city capabilities.15

Public transport

In general, public transport can provide excellent
access within urban areas when it is affordable to
the user, frequent, predictable, safe and integrated
within a comprehensive network.16 However, public
transport often entails high capital and operating costs
compared with private cars, although it is considerably more environmentally sustainable.17 To make
a comparison between the real cost of public versus
private motorized transport, it is essential that the
full cost include social costs, local pollution and

global greenhouse gas emissions as well as the economic cost of congestion.
Rail has the highest capital costs of all public
transport modes, irrespective of per capita national
incomes (Figure 8.2). While the capital costs range
widely, they are consistently higher than for other
modes. It has been estimated that the total per
kilometre capital cost for metros generally ranges
between US$50 million and US$150 million (2002
US$ values).18 BRT capital costs (i.e. stations and dedicated lanes) are considerably lower and the systems
are built faster than rail. A US study (from 2001)
found the average capital cost per kilometre of
BRT lines to be about US$8.4 million, compared to
US$21.6 million for light rail.19 Similarly, in India,
the first phase of the BRT system in Ahmedabad cost
only 5 per cent of the capital cost of the Delhi Metro
(US$1.4 million and US$30 million per kilometre,
respectively).20 A major reason for the high cost of
metro construction is related to tunnel excavation.
Construction of each kilometre of metro underground lines has been estimated to be between
four and six times more costly than for lines above
the ground.21 However, BRT does generally entail
higher maintenance and operation costs than rail
(Figure 8.3).
Public transport is primarily financed through
fares, subsidies and value-capture arrangements.
Fares are perhaps the most contested component
of public transport financing. Cost recovery from fares
ranges widely (Box 8.1). In many cases, fares are not
affordable to large segments of the population. Box
8.3 shows that fares and other transport costs can
comprise a sizable share of income for low-income

and poor populations.22 When fares increase, riders
may protest, and ridership may decline to the effect
of precluding any revenue increases – as in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) in 2004 and Lomé (Togo) in
2009.23
Thus, international aid and/or broader-based
subsidies must be sought to support public transport systems.24 These range from taxes on individuals
and employers, to industry and sales. Public transport can also be supported by tolls collected on
bridges and tunnels in the adjoining metropolitan
region.25 In London (UK), public transport is supported in part by congestion charges paid by drivers
of private cars entering into the central business
district. Subsidies may also be tied to real estate
transactions (as in New York, US).26 In general, the
mix of public transport subsidies should produce a
stream of revenue that is steady and reliable over
time, and not subject to political and economic
shifts. Strong regulatory and governing institutions
are necessary to collect and distribute funds for
public transport at a large scale.
In recent years, ‘value capture’, the practice
of linking fees and taxes on the indirect but real
beneficiaries of transport access, has emerged as an
attractive political approach to the challenge of
creating sustainable revenue sources for public
transport.27 It is typically presented as a third method
of finance, though the congestion charges and real
estate transaction fees described above could fairly
be interpreted as forms of value capture. The most
frequently cited contemporary example of value
capture is the system of sustainable finance that
supports public transportation in Hong Kong (Box

Box 8.1 Public transport cost recovery from fares
In general, the situations where fare-box recovery is adequate
to support the public transport system are in places where
density of use is high, public transport runs on exclusive rights
of way and where affluent users prefer public transport to
private cars. Two types of situation fit this scenario:
•

•

Certain Asian cities such as Hong Kong,a Singapore,b
Tokyoc and Osakac and Taipei.d The fare-box recovery
ratio in Hong Kong in 2007 was 149 per cent.a
High-speed rail lines that connect major airports to city
centres, such as the Heathrow Express in London (UK);
the Arlanda Express in Stockholm (Sweden); the Brussels
Airport Train (Belgium); Schipol–Amsterdam train (the
Netherlands) and the Shanghai Maglev (China).e

8.7). The policy notion of value capture in Hong Kong
is to ensure that all or a portion of the value created
and embedded in the location value of land parcels
that is attributable to transport is directed towards
investment in transport infrastructure or operation.28
Public–private partnership29 concessions have
met with limited success in public transportation
projects (see, for example, the experience of the
London Underground,30 New Delhi’s failed privatization of buses in the early 1990s, and similar failures
in Pakistan).31
n

Informal motorized transport

Informal motorized transport (minibuses, shared
taxis, motorbike taxis, etc.) can operate much like
public transport from the user’s perspective, but is
usually managed by private, for-profit companies or
individuals. Each informal transport system may
have its own fare structure that is not integrated with
the rest of the public transport system. And, as mentioned in Chapter 6, in Tanzania (and several other
countries), informal transport buses refuse to provide
rides to free-fare students.32
Fare regimes within the informal transport
system often vary by market segments and the
perceived price sensitivities of customers. A study
of Malaysia’s trishaw industry for example found that
different fare structures were charged to regular
customers (lowest), casual customers, goods, prostitute runs, tourists (highest).33 Differentiated pricing
is also seen as weather or road conditions change.
For instance, in Nairobi, Kenya, fares are often increased during heavy rains, as is the case in much of
South-Eastern Asia during the monsoon season.34
Informal motorized transport uses collectively
provided infrastructure, namely roads. They usually
do not have built stations but avail themselves of
roadside stops that often cause other traffic to be
delayed and backed up. Their capital costs are thus

For cities in Europe the modal fare-box recovery ratios are in
the range 30–50 per cent. The fare-box recovery ratios in
North American cities with high density and strong fixed rail
systems are comparable to those in Europe. However, in the
lower density North American cities the rates go down to as
little as 9 per cent.d In Burkina Faso, the public-private bus
system, SOTRACO, covers 59 per cent of operating costs
from fare revenues.f

relatively low, while operating costs are kept low
through low wages and minimal administration.
Motorcycle taxis are even less expensive to operate
than minibuses, since fuel and repairs cost less. Due
to these implicit subsidies, lack of administrative
overhead and freedom from regulations (that might
forestall safety and environmental problems), informal
motorized transport is able to earn a profit from rider
fares although profit margins may be low.35
Situations such as these illustrate the ways in
which uncompensated social costs subsidize the
financial viability for informal sector transport providers. Legally collecting fees and taxes from informal
transport modes has proven to be bureaucratically
difficult, as in Cotonou, Benin,36 although police
and other officials are known to regularly extort fees
from informal transport operators. Many cities in
developing countries struggle with formalizing the
informal public transportation sector to improve
service and safety.
n

Private motorized transport

Private motorized transport, including cars and
motorcycles, is often the most expensive mode for
the traveller. As shown in the previous section, the
use of private cars increases with income. Private
vehicle use ranges from 7 per cent of residents of
Addis Ababa37 (Ethiopia) to 87.9 per cent of work
trips in the US.38 Travellers must purchase or lease
a vehicle, buy insurance and registration, pay tolls
and charges, buy fuel and maintain the vehicle.
Finally, there is a choke point of congestion
when each private vehicle reduces space and diminishes the quality and speed of the trip for all other
vehicles. Depending on system design, private
vehicles can also interfere with the operation of
public transportation. The cost of congestion is however difficult to measure.39

ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE
TRANSPORT SECTOR

Transportation

Table 8.1

by region (2009)

Urban transportation is a vital urban public service
and an integral input into the economic life of its
city-region. While the overall size of the transport
sector varies from economy to economy it tends
to account for a small but significant proportion of
GDP. In the US, for example, transport accounted
for about 8.5 per cent of the GDP in 2009,40 compared to between 3 and 8 per cent in the countries
of Asia and the Pacific.41
The demand for transport is what economists
call a derived demand: a demand generated in pursuit
of another goal. Transportation of people and goods
is rarely undertaken as an end in itself.
The direct and indirect contribution of transport
spending to overall productivity and employment
creation is valuable. Thus, it is important to create
transport systems that are as efficient and effective
as possible in terms of both their monetary and
social costs. In Houston (US) where over 70 per cent
of commuting is done by private cars, the costs of
urban transport absorb 14 per cent of GDP. The
comparable proportion for New York City (US),
where over 50 per cent of commuting is done by

public transport, is about one-third less of regional
GDP or about 9.4 per cent.42
In addition to being a major factor of production
and urban consumption, urban transport is a major
source of employment. It has been conservatively
estimated that in 2009 the formal public transport
sector accounted for about 13 million full-time
equivalent jobs (as transport operators) worldwide.43 Of these jobs, some 7.3 million represent
direct employment by public transport operators
(Table 8.1). The rest are employed directly by public
authorities (300,000 people) or involved in the
provision of goods and services to public transport
operators and authorities44 (5 million people). Public
transport operators are the largest employers in
Amsterdam (the Netherlands), Barcelona (Spain),
Brussels (Belgium), Genoa (Italy) and Dublin (Ireland).
In Paris (France), Budapest (Hungary), Porto (Portugal), Madrid (Spain), Turin (Italy) and Tallinn
(Estonia), public transport operators rank among the
city’s top-five employers.45
However, in many developing countries transport is primarily characterized by informal sector
employment.46 In most cities of Sub-Saharan Africa,
employment in the informal urban transport industry
is a mainstay of the local urban economy. In Kenya,
some 40,000 matatus (minivans) provide 80,000
direct and 80,000 indirect jobs, mostly in urban
areas.47 In South Africa, the ‘Kombi taxi’ (the urban
minivans) created approximately 185,000 direct jobs
and 150,000 indirect jobs in 2003. In Kampala, it
is estimated that the informal minivan industry employs between 40,000 and 60,000 people.48 These
numbers are suggestive of the high importance of
informal transport sector employment in many developing countries.
The transport sector also often creates higher
overall levels of income. In Geneva, it is estimated
that for every US$1 invested, another US$3.8 of
value added is created.49 Worldwide, it has been
estimated that every US$1 of value created by public
transport is linked to the further value creation of
US$4. In addition, ‘every direct job in public transport is linked to four jobs in other sectors of the
economy’.50 Similar multipliers are observed in the
US with more than 36,000 jobs created for every
US$1 billion invested in public transport.51
Transportation is a service produced through the
creation of networked infrastructure, sidewalks,
streets, roads, highways and railways. The process
of producing this infrastructure is thus both a
contribution to present employment and future
productivity. It has been estimated that some US$7.8
trillion will be spent on transport infrastructure
projects globally between 2005 and 2030 (Table 8.2).
Although all transport investments are creating
employment, it is worth noting that the creation
of public transport infrastructure in the US appears
to have almost twice as much job stimulus as a

comparable amount spent on highway infrastructure.52 What is perhaps most striking about the data
in this table is that the regions with the lowest projected infrastructure investments are the ones that
are likely to experience the most severe urban
mobility challenges, due to rapid urbanization.53 The
two regions with the lowest projected investments
for example (i.e. Africa and the Middle East), are likely
to more than double their urban populations between
2005 and 2030, compared to an increase of only 16
per cent in developed countries.54
The costs associated with road traffic accidents
are often overlooked in the context of transport
economics but should always be accounted for in
policy-making.55 The total annual cost of road traffic
accidents has been estimated at US$518 billion, or
about 1–3 per cent of global GDP.56

FROM ECONOMICS OF
MOBILITY TOWARDS
ECONOMICS OF ACCESS
One of the most powerful justifications for the
disproportionate funding of private motorized transport is that it saves time. This in turn leads to the
evolution of urban transport policies that promote
extensive reliance on ever more mobility to solve the
urban congestion and access problems. However,
in the context of urban living, mobility is just one of
two means for achieving access. As noted earlier
in this report, access can also be achieved through
co-location of urban activities. As a practical challenge
of policy-making, the attraction of enhanced mobility
is that it is easy to measure and hence to value, while
co-location – or mixed-use urban land arrangements
– is difficult to monetize. This methodological
constraint has skewed cost–benefit analyses to favour
mobility-oriented infrastructure projects over ones
that might enhance co-location.
This section shows how (and why) the value of
mobility over access leads to the promotion of private
motorized transport over more sustainable modes,
and revisits the framing of cost–benefit approaches
to transport project evaluation.

What has time saving got to do with it?
As a result of the problems in measuring the benefits of co-location, much of the treatment of urban
transport as an economic good focuses on its mobility
value, usually measured as travel time saved.57 The
presumption behind this is that if mobility promotes
access, measuring the value of time saved in travel
is a good proximate measure for the ultimate end
product, i.e. more time in other pursuits.
Because time spent in motion (i.e. mobility)
is such a relatively straightforward concept to
understand and to measure, it provides a powerful

basis for valuing transport improvements. If the value
of the benefits exceeds the cost of the project, it is
deemed worthwhile. It is from this insight that
modern cost–benefit analysis for transport decisionmaking evolved.58
Cost–benefit analysis is now the primary tool
through which governments, international financial
institutions and bilateral donors make decisions on
major public works projects. Its elements have
become so standardized that few question the
shortcomings of using enhanced mobility as a proxy
for urban access. But at a time when the economic
and environmental costs of mobility are becoming
difficult to sustain, it is important to rethink this
approach.
A recent look at a cross-section of transport
cost–benefit analyses across the UK concluded that
approximately 80 per cent of the identified benefits
in transport derive from the monetary value assigned
to time savings. However, the amount of time spent
in urban travel in the UK has remained constant
at around one hour per day for three decades. Travel
diary studies demonstrate that the benefit of transport improvements provide a greater range of spatial
access within the same travel time budget over
time.59 If this is the case, there is a need to better
assess ‘the value of access’ as distinct from the hypothesized benefit of ‘time saved’ in considering transport investments.

Measuring the value of access
To the extent that transport improves the ability of
an urban area to maximize the agglomerative benefits
of access – i.e. the economies of market density and
supplier density – it adds significant value to the local
economy. A working definition of the benefits of
agglomeration would be the increase in individual per
worker productivity that results from improved
access. A recent study of London’s Crossrail project
(Box 8.2) uses such calculation methods on a largescale public transport project, in order to capture
access benefits along with travel-time saving benefits.
Adding these agglomerative benefits to the more
traditional time-cost savings benefits raised the traditional time savings based benefit–cost ratio between
36 and 93 per cent. While the methodologies used
to measure these effects can be debated – and have
led to considerable discussion – the important point
is that these estimates provide an empirical sense of
the sizable benefits that access conveys. Most important for matters of economic sustainability, they open
up the possibility that access and hence economic
wellbeing can be improved upon via the co-locational
characteristics of places. This includes more reliance
on pedestrian and bicycle access, as well as more
and better public transport options, both of which
are critical to an economics of sustainable urban
transport.

Box 8.2 Crossrail and agglomeration benefits, London, UK
Crossrail is a new addition to the London Underground, which
is scheduled to start operations in 2018. It is intended to
increase carrying capacity by 10 per cent in the portion of the
system serving central London. Using conventional analysis,
Crossrail yielded a strong traditional benefit–cost ratio of 2.55.
Fifty-four per cent of the benefit takes the form of travel-time
saving and 43 per cent from increased network carrying
capacity.
By including the wider economic benefits of
agglomeration, a second benefit–cost ratio was calculated. In
the latter instance the ratio increases to between 3.47 and
4.91. About one-third of this increased benefit is due to higher

Urban mobility is both a private and a
public good
An economic analysis of sustainable urban mobility
must consider the complex nature of mobility as an
economic good. Mobility as a commodity lends itself
to the standard economics of supply and demand, as
it is conceivable in the context of private markets
where buyers and sellers agree upon quantities and
prices. Even the presence of ‘externalities’ is correctable via disincentives, such as taxes on negative
externalities (like air pollution) and congestion
charging and parking fees (Box 8.5) to discourage
excessive car use and incentives for positive externalities, such as access to ‘free’ bicycles and welldesigned and walkable streets.
In the language of economics, mobility has the
two distinguishing characteristics of a private good,
rivalry in consumption and excludability in ownership.
Rivalry refers to the notion that what one individual
consumes cannot also be consumed by another.
If one individual buys a ticket to a certain seat on a
train, a second individual cannot occupy the same
seat for the same trip. Excludability means that the
owners of the vehicle can deny entry to those not
purchasing a ticket to ride.
While the case for mobility as a private good is
powerful, the case for the access that it creates as a
public good is more compelling, and for the same
reasons. Turning the two characteristics of a private
good around implies a public good: non-rivalry in
consumption and non-excludability in ownership.
Access is characterized by both non-rivalry and nonexcludability. When one person accesses the city by
working or living there, she does not harm another’s
ability to access the city. In fact, she increases the
value of another person accessing the city. Although
one can conceive of exceptions, access to a city’s
opportunities is likewise non-excludable, because
there is no entry fee to a city. The mobility option
one must use to get there, however, may be characterized by both rivalry and excludability, depending

worker productivity, due to the higher levels of urbanization
and localization economies created by improved access. The
remainder of the added benefit is linked to increased tax
revenue generated from the transformation of less productive
to more productive jobs plus the improved locational value of
the areas served and increased labour force participation.
Comparing the initial benefit–cost ratio with the
benefit–cost ratios that include the wider economic benefits of
access and agglomeration, the ratio increases between 36 per
cent (at a benefit–cost ratio of 3.47) and 93 per cent (at a
benefit–cost ratio of 4.91).

it is on the presumption of private goods, is a limited
tool for establishing useful financial models to support
urban mobility.
The working formulation for an economics of
sustainable urban mobility is one in which the
planning and policy target is maximum access and
minimal mobility. An ideal sustainable city is one
where the need to expend resources in movement
of people and goods is at the lowest possible level.
The co-locational properties of the city – the opportunities for specialization and innovation made
possible by the density and diversity of people and
firms – are the desired social good. Mobility serves
as the means to access these goods. The economic
sustainability of urban mobility relates the value
created by transport in enhancing accessibility even
as it minimizes the environmental and social costs
of mobility. Thus, as physical realities, cities are the
co-location of activities to avoid the need to travel.60

Road pricing is necessary but normally
not sufficient to improve urban
accessibility
There is considerable evidence that car users in
most countries do not pay a high enough price to
cover the full cost to society of this travel mode.61
In practical terms, this implies that the society at large
is in effect subsidizing private motorized transport
(through the costs of addressing economic, social and
environmental externalities). From the point of view
of conventional microeconomics, the standard
diagnosis is that the market for urban car travel is
inefficient. The policy solutions to correct that
inefficiency call for ‘getting prices right’.
The policy recommendations that flow from
‘right’ pricing are the creation of methods to
effectively raise the cost of car usage to better reflect
the environmental and social costs that this travel
mode imposes on society. ‘Full cost pricing’, as this

approach is known, seeks to impose licenses and fees
via taxes on drivers that approximate the economic
value of the social and environmental costs. An
example of this can be seen in Singapore where the
government has implemented a number of financial
disincentives to curb car ownership,62 and encourage
a modal shift to non-motorized and public transport.
However, even if this policy worked as predicted,
it is at best a partial solution, as the goal of such
pricing is to decrease the use of cars. Unless the
revenues raised are sufficient to cover the costs of
added public transport to provide substitute service,
such pricing is at best a necessary and not a sufficient
condition in terms of meeting the access needs of a
city-region. Furthermore, such a policy has significant
risks in terms of social equity. The drivers that it
prices out of the market will be the ones with the
least ability to pay the higher costs. Moreover, it does
nothing to meet the ongoing needs of the large mass
of lower-income residents who were not driving in
the first place. Thus, policies are also required that
directly address the underlying reasons for urban
travel, and that address the problems of those for
whom, even at comparatively low market prices, car
travel is out of reach.63

The private car versus public transport:
Markets and modal choices
If one considers the data presented in Figure 8.1 and
nothing else, it is easy to conclude that there is strong
universal urban desire for car-based travel. If that is
the wish of the world’s urban population, shouldn’t
policy and planning goals aim to satisfy this market
demand in a manner that is as environmentally sound
and socially equitable as possible? It is difficult to
argue with that policy interpretation given the globally
poor state of public transport alternatives.
The problem with this view is technological
reality. The idealized promise of the car can only be
achieved in cities if certain unlikely technological
changes are made: if vehicles cost little to own and
maintain, use little energy, do not pollute and emit
greenhouse gases, and lack the physical need for
expanded road space and parking places. Lacking
these conditions, pressing social and environmental
concerns will continue to render the dream of
personal freedom of mobility as theoretical fantasy
– or as an unrelenting urban nightmare – if attempted
in practice.
As the evidence presented in this report makes
exceedingly clear, there are public transport
alternatives – as well as pedestrian and other nonmotorized forms of travel – that can make a scalable
difference in terms of both personal mobility and
urban sustainability. The experiences in some Asian
and European cities – where public transport trip
speeds exceed those of private cars – exemplify the
potential of enhanced public transport.64 In light of

this, a more realistic interpretation of Figure 8.1 is
that it reflects things as they are: a less than ideal
choice between an often unreliable and unsafe public
system and being stuck in slow-moving traffic in a
car-based system.
However, it is public finance, and not private
market decisions, that is the final arbiter of the
quantity and quality of the urban transport options.
The reason that public finance becomes the crucial
determinant of the choices that define private
markets is that once one moves beyond walking and
other forms of non-motorized transport, motorized
transport modes are never fully supported by charges
to travellers. Motorized transport requires funding
beyond what users pay directly, as discussed in the
section below. In order to develop urban public
transport systems that are of sufficient quality and
quantity, and that also reduce environmental and
social equity problems, policy-makers must confront
the reality that user charges will never be sufficient.

THE PERENNIAL FINANCIAL
PROBLEM: COSTS EXCEED
REVENUES
The continual fiscal challenge for any urban public
transport supplier is avoiding a negative cash flow:
attaining either a zero balance between income and
expenditure, or a positive cash flow to finance future
improvements. This requires bridging the difference
between fare revenues and the full costs of service
while encouraging efficient operations in a manner
that is sustainable over time. This challenge is not
easy nor are the solutions free of controversy. This
section explores the dimensions of this chronic
funding gap. The next section explores potential
solutions.

User charges are never sufficient to
finance public transport
There is no obvious theoretical reason that prevents
urban public transport from covering its full costs via
charges on its users. But in practice, as noted in Box
8.1, there are only a handful of instances where fares
represent both full cost recovery and sufficient profit
to permit a private market to sustainably meet the
needs of passenger travel.65 The experience in some
transitional countries, such as Poland, in the early
1990s captures the essence of the problem:
‘. . . cost recovery in major cities appeared to be
too low to generate sufficient funds for replacing
and modernizing bus and tram fleets. It led to
worsening of the quality of public transport and
was another reason . . . for undesirable modal
shifts.’66

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

This experience highlights the two ways that
policy-makers have attempted to ‘solve’ the cash-flow
problem: fare increases and competitive tendering.
These solutions typically fall short because policymakers are often not clear about their policy goals.
Is urban transport a private good with some public
benefits or is it a public good with private benefits?
Depending on how one chooses to answer that
question, the policy outcomes are very different. This
report is built around the clear premise that urban
transport, because it facilitates access, is fundamentally a public good. The policy goal is to strengthen the use of public (and non-motorized) transport.
Its private good’s features can be leveraged to provide
some of the needed revenue, but that, by itself, will
not be adequate.
If public transport is viewed solely as a means
of private conveyance to satisfy private demands, it
has a higher chance of success, but such success has
a price. The transport system either does not operate
at sufficient volume to positively impact urban spatial
patterns in a sustainable or equitable manner, or –
if the volume is adequate – the quality is exceedingly
low and everyone who can avoid it does. Rising rates
of car ownership and car use for work and education
trips are the result. The starting point for confronting
the financial challenge is to recognize that if urban
public transport is to generate its valuable public
goods benefits (i.e. to promote access), revenue
sources beyond the fare box are needed.
No matter how hard policy-makers and officials
try to make public transport self-supporting through
the fare box and reorganizational moves, such as
competitive tendering to improve efficiency, these
reforms always fall short. It is not that fare policy and
organizational form are unimportant; on the contrary,
they are exceedingly important. By themselves these
second-order conditions are not sufficient if accessibility is the policy goal. The policy challenge is to
broaden both the sustainable mass usage of the
service and encourage revenue sources that go
beyond the fare box. The goal is to create viable financial models that align organizational forms for service
delivery with the unique transport needs of each
metropolitan area.

The high private cost of transport
As discussed above,67 the problem on the consumer
side is that while travellers in developing countries do pay high transport prices relative to their
income, the amount paid is insufficient relative to
the revenue sums required at full cost recovery.
Transportation costs for urban and low-income populations are always high, measured either in terms of
money or time (Box 8.3). In developed countries, the
costs tend to be in money terms. In developing
countries, people tend to spend more hours of the
day in moving from place to place.
Poor-quality transportation entails high costs
that are often not distributed equally across the city
or within households. For example, women may
become stranded as they attempt to link trips for
childcare and employment; the elderly may reduce
the number of trips they make; and children may have
dangerous or tedious trips to school. Only counting
the monetary expenditure of travel, measured in
terms of personal or household incomes, these costs
can account for anywhere from one-tenth to one-fifth
of income for high-income individuals and households. For the poor, it can account for nearly half of
their income.
These income constraints limit the amount
of revenue that users can contribute to the costs of
maintaining the urban transport system. This problem
is especially acute in developing countries. Attempts
to resolve revenue shortfalls by increasing the costs
to populations that are already paying a fare that
severely taxes their ability to pay is clearly an
extremely inequitable approach, and is thus not
likely to succeed.

Good quality urban transport: The
system is the solution
The value of urban transport is directly related to
its quality as an integrated system, distinct from a
collection of independent modal options and specific
routes. The more options that urban residents have
to access work, education, shopping, social connections, etc., the more value-added the city creates.68

Box 8.3 The high personal cost of urban transport: Anglophone Sub-Saharan Africa
Studies from Nairobi (Kenya), Lagos (Nigeria) and South Africa
show that lower-income households pay from 15 to 54 per
cent of their income in transportation costs. Public
transportation fares are high and poorly regulated. In Lagos,
for example, bus drivers often force riders to exit and reboard paying an additional fare to continue their trip. Riders
must often bargain with drivers for the price of the fare. For
the poor, high transport costs diminish their access to basic
needs. It erodes the efficiency of individual economic activities
as well as reducing national and municipal economic efficiency.

Furthermore, a 1990 study of four Eastern African cities
showed that non-motorized transport – walking and cycling –
was inadequately accommodated. Walking meets up to half the
transport demand and accounts for only 1 per cent of the total
transport costs. In contrast, private motorized transport
meets less than 10 per cent of demand, yet accounts for over
half the costs.

The financial danger is that in a quest for saving
money, specific routes are at times valued on an
individual basis and not as part of a system. Individual
routes can at times cover operating costs and
occasionally some or all of their capital cost when
travel demand is sufficiently intense. This typically
occurs along major public transport routes serving
the highest density portions of urban central business
districts. Singapore and Hong Kong are the best
examples of this. However, the public goods value
of access derives from the existence of entire urban
transport systems and not just travel on its densest
routes.69 Less-dense routes that make the entire
system viable often cost more to operate than the
revenue from fares can cover. But without these
feeders, the diversity of opportunities that contribute
to the creation of urban value would be lost. The
greater the degree of system integration within
and across modes, the higher the degree of valuable
access the system creates. To achieve that valuable
goal requires public-led investments in infrastructure,
equipment and service delivery.

EXPANDING THE
FINANCIAL OPTIONS
FOR PUBLIC AND NONMOTORIZED TRANSPORT
In what direction should the public sector proceed
in order to expand financial support for urban public
and non-motorized transport beyond user-generated
revenues? This section examines four possible
approaches (as well as combinations of these),
namely:
• Direct allocations from general municipal and
national revenues (i.e. from general taxations);
• Other allocations from government sources;
• Financial arrangements that allow the transport
system to capture a portion of the value that they
create through urban access (i.e. value capture);
• Other arrangements that allow public–private
partnerships to capture the value created by transport systems.70

General revenue models
The most common way in which governments meet
the funding gap for urban transport is via allocations
from general tax receipts. It reflects a general belief
in the public goods value that the service creates.
To the extent that governments treat public transport as just one among many public services such as
police protection and education, this arrangement can
work well. This approach is widespread in China, for
example. Urban transport there is typically supported

through general revenue allocations from the local
municipal government, with rail-based more favoured
than bus-based. In Shanghai, as part of its accommodation of World Expo, the government allocated
an additional US$541 million71 to ensure smooth
operations in 2009.72
In virtually every city there are some general
revenues used to support the urban transport system
in one way or another. In Curitiba, Brazil, the fares
on the BRT system cover the operating costs for the
private companies that supply services, including
reduced and free tickets for some categories of
riders. Nonetheless, the user-generated revenue
does not cover all of the infrastructure costs. The
municipality supports the construction and maintenance of the street-based exclusive rights of way
on which the system operates from its general
revenue sources.73
One of the weaknesses of general revenue as a
financial source is its political vulnerability. In cities
where public transport is viewed as a largely private
good, any forms of public support are often looked
upon as temporary and easily dispensed with in the
belief that the fiscal problems are the self-inflicted
wounds of an incompetent industry. This is especially
the case in austere fiscal times (such as the current
global financial crisis), when politicians can adopt this
rationale as they search for a politically easy place to
cut public spending. These losses of support always
cause cuts in services and higher fares, just when
more people need mobility to find work and have less
money to spend on it.
Another form of political vulnerability that
should be mentioned here is that related to changes
in political leadership at the city and national level.
This applies not only to changing political directions
related to the rise and fall of support for specific
political parties, but also to the departure of individuals that may have championed specific initiatives
in the transport sector.
Figure 8.4 provides an overview of sources of
operating revenue for public transport in five
developed country cities. The figure indicates that
three of the public transport operators – TriMet in
Portland (US), Translink in Vancouver (Canada)
and Sytral in Lyon (France) – collect more than
three-quarters of their operating revenues from either
fares or dedicated tax revenues (over which they exert
some degree of control). Operators that rely on
direct funding from local, provincial or national
governments for their revenue streams may more
easily be subject to the negative effects of changing
political climates.
Ideally, funding for non-motorized transport
should come from normal operative budgets from
departments dealing with transportation and public
works.74 However, funding for such infrastructure
investments could also be drawn from revenues from
advertising, road pricing/taxes and private-sector

Other allocations of public funds
Given the limitations of public funds to finance
public transport, many governments have also appropriated funds from other revenues and tax incomes,
mainly from indirect beneficiaries, i.e. individuals and
organizations who are not necessarily users of public
transport, but are understood to benefit from the

Box 8.4 Urban road pricing initiatives
The primary objective of most urban road pricing initiatives is
to reduce congestion levels during periods of peak travel
demand. However, such initiatives may have additional goals,
such as generating revenue, reducing environmental impacts
and encouraging public transport use. When financing is the
main purpose of road pricing, the aim is to design a system
that provides steady and reliable revenues. Quite often the
purpose may be to finance the cost of new infrastructure, for
example a new road or bridge. The manner in which these
revenues are used is often the key to obtaining public
acceptance for the scheme – even if the primary goal is
congestion management. An overview of different types of
road pricing initiatives is included in Figure 8.5.
The first modern road pricing system in the world was
implemented in Singapore in 1975. The purpose of the system
is to regulate traffic, by achieving a target speed that gives
improved accessibility. Every three months the fees are revised
upward or downward, based on whether the travel speeds are
above or below the desired speed. In 2001, the project
sponsors introduced an environmental component to the
scheme by charging a reduced fee for electric or hybrid cars.
Oslo, Norway, introduced an electronic road toll system
in 1990, with 19 tolling stations that control access to the city
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Emphasis was placed on the
generation of revenues necessary to finance new road and
public transport projects. As a result, the traffic impacts of the
toll system itself have been minimal, with only a 3–4 per cent

reduction in traffic. The annual operating costs of the toll
system account for approximately 10 per cent of annual
revenues, while the remainder is used to support road and
public transport investments.
Other systems have since been introduced in a number
of cities around the world. In developing countries where
traffic levels are low, or where construction costs are high, it
is unlikely that the tolls will cover more than operation and
maintenance, and perhaps a part of the construction cost. In
Mexico, for example, the main reasons for the failure of road
concession projects have been attributed to: lower than
expected revenues due to traffic shortfalls; excessively high
toll rates; and the currency crisis of 1994.
Even though urban road pricing initiatives are designed
to generate socially desired benefits, experience shows that
there are major obstacles encountered during the planning
phases related to public acceptance, equity, politics,
economics, technology and the design of the pricing scheme.
In the 1980s, the city of Hong Kong considered the
introduction of an electronic congestion scheme. The public
response, however, was unfavourable, as there were significant
privacy concerns about the government’s ability to track users’
movements and identities, and the initiative failed.

may get diverted to other purposes, particularly
during periods of economic austerity or changes in

A well-known example of such economically
derived revenue charges is the versement transport

employers within the urban area (Box 8.6) on the
rationale that they benefit from increased productivity
as a result of employees and customers having better
access to work and commercial locations.77 Other

Box 8.5 Parking charges: A promising source of finance for public and non-motorized transport
Parking charges have been introduced in many local authorities
in cities across the world, as a source of revenue to finance
local transport services. In Milton Keynes (UK), revenues from
parking fees are dedicated to supporting public transport.
Similar implementations worldwide include Aspen (Colorado,
US), Miami (Florida, US), La Spezia, Verona and Milan (Italy).
Current parking planning practices tend to favour
generous parking supply and minimal parking places, which
have unintended and undesirable consequences: they increase
development costs, reduce housing affordability, increase
private car use and contribute to urban sprawl. As result,
everyone but the motorist pays for parking. Consequently,
problems such as traffic congestion, road infrastructure costs,
road traffic accidents and pollution emissions are further
exacerbated.
Recognizing the need for parking planning and
management reforms, urban planners have proposed the
introduction of various forms of parking fees and taxes.

165

Such taxes can help raise funds and achieve various planning
objectives, including more compact development and
increased use of alternative modes. In Barcelona (Spain),
100 per cent of the revenue gathered from parking tariffs goes
to operate ‘Bicing’, the city’s public bike system.
Parking is increasingly being linked to public transport,
and park-and-ride schemes have been introduced in many
cities across the world, as an efficient means of managing car
travel demand. This also allows for increased flexibility and
enhanced intermodality for travellers, in particular women
who tend to have several destinations for their trips,
as they may need the car to drop off their children at school,
but might prefer to use public transport to get to work. In
Prague (Czech Republic), park-and-ride facilities are
established near metro and railway stations. These car parks
offer low all-day prices, which include the fare for the public
transport system.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 8.6 Versement transport, Paris, France
Versement transport was first introduced in 1971 for the Ile
de France (Paris) region, with the purpose of providing a
consistent funding base to operate and invest in public
transport. Versement transport is a compulsory tax levied on
public and private companies with more than nine employees,
with rates collected as a percentage of a company’s total
payroll costs (although with a fixed ceiling imposed by the
state). Over the years, the geographical coverage of this
scheme has extended to all metropolitan areas with a public
transport authority. The tax rate is determined by local
authorities but varies from region to region, ranging from
0.5 per cent to 2.6 per cent.
Before this tax was implemented, public transport in
France was mainly funded through user fares. However the
revenue base generated from versement transport now

benefits include increased property values where land
is serviced by public transport and for other road users
who experience less congestion.

Value-capture models

Value-capture
approaches work
best in cities
where there is
initially low per
capita car use and
where the
population is
growing

Since direct public funding is almost always politically
vulnerable (particularly in periods of financial
austerity), it is preferable to link publicly sponsored
forms of financial support as directly as possible to
the benefits urban mobility bestows upon indirect
beneficiaries. It is within that context that locationbased taxes and assessments to support transport
service have become popularly labelled as valuecapture systems. The term reflects the reality that
urban transport does, via external benefits, create
value for parties not directly using the service. This
approach is politically appealing because it is able to
explain how the charge relates to the benefit and to
provide qualitative support commensurate with the
needs of a growing city.
Hong Kong is undoubtedly the best-known
instance where a provider of public transport covers
the full costs and attains a profit through the use of
a value-capture model.78 The essential elements of
this unusual situation result from the unique, publicprivate, corporate structure of the service provider,
i.e. the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC)
(Box 8.7). It has both a public mission to provide transport to a major city, but at the same time (thanks to
the public trading of its minority shares) it is strongly
governed by the earnings considerations of the
private market. This arrangement bestows important urban access benefits on the entire Hong Kong
region. And, due to a direct linkage to the ongoing
real estate yields, the MTRC is able to sustain urban
public transport via the process of value capture.
The practice as it has evolved in Hong Kong is
unique to the institutional arrangements there.

represents a major source of finance, which has lowered the
costs of public transport while also supporting large-scale
infrastructure projects, such as Strasbourg’s light-rail system
and the implementation of the metro in Marseille. In 2007,
the incomes from versement transport in the Paris region
accounted for a third of all funds allocated to public
transport.
However, critics believe that versement transport adds
more to the cost of labour, something which is undesirable
given the high rates of unemployment. It has also been
criticized for encouraging urban sprawl, as companies relocate
their business outside the main urban area to avoid paying
such taxes.
Sources: CODATU, 2009; Cabinet Alain Thomas, undated; Bouf and Hensher, 2007;
Allen, 2011b.

However, the underlying principle has widespread
applicability. Although the term value capture is of
recent vintage, the principle has long been understood as an important element in the creation of
urban public transportation (Box 8.8). The lesson
learned from the Hong Kong experience is that it is
possible to practice value capture in service to the
public interest. However, other cities also have a tradition of financing transportation projects by taxing
real estate that benefits from infrastructure projects.
In Bogotá, Colombia, for example, road expansion,
improvement of public space, bicycle paths and
TransMilenio lines have all benefited from this kind
of financing.79
It is the principle of creating an agency that is
capable of bridging the land use and transport divide
in the service of enhanced urban access that is the
important lesson to draw from the experience. The
range of experiments with parking fees, highway
tolls, congestion charges and land taxes are all variations on the principle of value capture (Box 8.4). Taxincrement financing also works according to the
same principle: when a site’s value increases due to
the implementation of new transport infrastructure,
the government can anticipate an additional increment in real estate taxes, and can borrow against this
anticipated tax revenue to finance implementation of
the transport infrastructure.80 Similarly, private investors may provide capital for transportation projects in
exchange for a share of revenue over time.81
Value-capture approaches work best in cities
where there is initially low per capita car use and
where the population is growing.82 The first condition
means that there is less resistance to overcoming car
dependence and the second means that there is a
strong potential customer base for the system. These
conditions hold almost universally in the rapidly
growing cities of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In
cities where population growth is stable or even

Box 8.7 Hong Kong and its Mass Transit Railway Corporation, China
Hong Kong’s MTRC builds, owns and operates all the rail
lines in Hong Kong. MTRC is unique among public
transportation providers, in that it is a private for-profit
corporation that is 76.7 per cent owned by the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, which in turn owns all land in
Hong Kong. The rest of the shares are publicly traded on the
Hong Kong stock exchange. Due to its relationship with
MTRC, the government is able to capture the monetary value
of the access and agglomeration economies that its transport
service generates.
Hong Kong’s unique financial model works as follows.
The Hong Kong government makes land around future station
stops available to the MTRC on long-term lease at pretransport development prices. The MTRC then sells the rights
to develop these sites – at post-development prices – to
designated private developers, who leverage the station
locations for the creation of shopping malls and housing.
The substantial difference between the two prices pays for the
capital cost of the new rail infrastructure.
Furthermore, and most importantly, MTRC also
negotiates a share of future property-development profits
and/or a co-ownership position from the highest bidder,

i.e. the MTRC retains a long-term claim on the rental income
stream of these projects. Thus, MTRC is paid up front for land,
plus a post-development share of the development’s revenues,
in addition to collecting fares. It is that long-term claim on
urban value that turns this enterprise from just another
struggling provider of public transport into a sterling
corporate performer.
Between 2001 and 2005, property developments –
i.e. development, investment and management – produced
62 per cent of MTRC’s revenues. Railway income, made up
mainly of fare-box receipts, generated 28 per cent of total
income. The remaining 10 per cent of income was generated
from advertisement and ownership of other assets
(i.e. telecommunication leases and convenience retail
shops).
One of the strong factors in the success of MTRC is that
– in addition to satisfying initial conditions (there is a strong
financial disincentive to car ownership, and population density
is quite high) – more than 40 per cent of Hong Kong’s
population resides within 500 metres of an MTRC station and
one in five households live within 200 metres of a station.

Box 8.8 Value capture has a long history to ensure private sector profits
In the early days of modern public transport, the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, private developers
who built the first street railway systems understood the
connection between the public transport improvements they
were creating and land values in the streets that abutted the
systems. They purchased land at the outskirts of the city and
gained franchises to operate public transport over the streets
running through the parcels of land they owned. They then
installed the street rail infrastructure and as soon as the land
had been developed and sold, the revenue-losing public transport routes were abandoned to the public sector to maintain
from that time forward.

declining and car use is extensive – as is the case in
many cities of North America and Europe – value
capture via claims on rising real estate revenues will
typically be disappointing, no matter how well they are
organized.
Assuming that the right demographic and modal
use conditions exist, the next most critical factor is
the distance between places of residence and public
transport stops, whether they are BRT or rail. It has
been estimated that for every 10 per cent increase
in distance from a public transport station, there is
a 1 per cent decline in property values.83 Hence the
closer the target population is to the public transport stops, the higher is the relative real estate value

Starting in the 1910s, these systems began to falter and
because they were by then vital public services, they soon
became publicly owned and operated systems with the
difference between costs and fare revenues provided by
municipal general funds. The history of urban public transport in North America is replete with examples of this. In
1917, for example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
passed its first public control act, taking over the public
transport routes running through the City of Boston to its
suburbs.
Sources: Edel et al, 1984; Schrag, 2000; Schaeffer and Sclar, 1980.

and the larger is the potential base of support for
the system (Box 8.7).
Three institutional factors in particular are vitally
important in the successful deployment of valuecapture mechanisms:
• Municipal governments need strong capability to
value land and levy land taxes as well as impose
fees on car users in the form of congestion charges
and parking fees.
• These governments need a strong ability to
regulate (if not control) the assembly of land
parcels that line up with plans for building transport infrastructure.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

• The capacity of government to act as a knowledgeable business partner is critical if the public–
private partnership’s ability to manage the attendant real estate developments is to be sustainable.

Other public–private partnerships

Public–private
partnership . . . is
a flexible concept
that runs across
a continuum of
contractual
arrangements

Value capture as practised in Hong Kong is a highly
specific application of a more general approach to the
provision of public services, called public–private
partnerships. A public–private partnership is a contractual agreement between a public sector entity –
such as a ministry, a department or agency – and a
private sector partner to deliver a specific facility or
service that is a public responsibility. A public–
private partnership model is not a single model.
Rather it is a flexible concept that runs across a
continuum of contractual arrangements ranging from
traditional forms of government procurement all the
way to total private ownership of publicly used infrastructure (Box 8.9).84
In terms of infrastructure, these arrangements
can include design, construction, renovation operation, maintenance or financing of practically any
public facility or public service. In terms of urban
mobility, the purpose of these arrangements – from
the perspective of the public partner – is to obtain
the benefits of expensive elements of networked
transport infrastructure, while avoiding the costs
and risks inherent in both construction and maintenance. For the private partner the ultimate goal is
a healthy return on the capital invested. Such arrangements involve contracts that may extend over
decades.
However, economists term such contractual
situations as ‘incomplete contracts’85 because it is

impossible to write a binding legal agreement that
can foresee all the possible permutations of circumstance in which the parties to the arrangement might
find themselves. As a result, the parties usually make
provisions such as requiring arbitration or some
other form of third-party governance to (hopefully)
resolve differences of opinion and circumstance, as
they will inevitably arise over the term of the
agreement. Nonetheless the difficulty of negotiating
such changing circumstances makes these arrangements far less stable in practice than they appear in
theory. As a result this requires that public partners
ask careful questions before engaging in such
arrangements.
One major unstated but powerful motivation
for the public partners in such situations is to pass
the risks of construction and maintenance off to the
private party. The private party’s motivation for incurring the risk is to gain a positive return on their
investment. Because the private party has a significant
amount of capital at risk they go to great lengths to
limit the extent of their risk and liability.86
In a typical infrastructure public–private partnership the private partner is actually a consortium
of firms that form what are known as ‘special purpose vehicles’, which are independent, stand-alone
entities tailored to the specific public-sector request.
These vehicles help insulate and contain the scope
of project-related risk to the parent companies.
The basic problem from a public perspective is that
ultimately the public sector can never fully off-load
the risk (see also Box 8.10). The private party always
has the option of bankruptcy to unburden themselves
of an untenable situation. But because the investment
involves vital elements of public infrastructure, the
public partner can never walk away. The result is that

Box 8.9 Types of public–private partnerships
Public-private partnership projects attempt to provide options between the extremes of full public and full private control. There
are a wide variety of potential public–private partnerships, as shown in the table below. In fact, a ‘partnership’ begins whenever the
government decides to allow the private sector to control one or more of the activities that it traditionally managed on its own.

Box 8.10 Economic rationale for using public–private partnerships
How can a public agency know if a public–private partnership
is a better arrangement than the more traditional way of
creating public infrastructure? The typical valuation process
employed to provide a proximate answer to this question is a
process called value-for-money analysis.
As public sector borrowing costs are normally less than
those of private parties, a straight comparison of construction
costs alone almost always favours public construction over a
public–private partnership. To avoid this problem, value-formoney analysis justifies the use of a public–private partnership
when it can be shown that the discounted financial costs, over
the life of the project, are lower than the costs of conventional
procurement.
However, it is virtually impossible to know if these
lifecycle costs will be lower. To get around this challenge,
public agencies often construct a hypothetical projection of
what the operation would cost if it remained public (based on
comparable past experiences from elsewhere). The basic

the public sector often finds itself in the position of
buying out the private partner at great cost to the
public treasury (Box 8.11).
In 1997, the UK Government decided to overhaul the London Underground, the world’s oldest
metro system, through a public–private partnership

problem for such a comparative cost analyst is deciding which
partner bears that risk over time; the more risk that can be
apportioned to the public sector, the higher are the costs of
the public sector comparator. Public–private partnership
proponents argue that risk should be borne by the party most
able to carry it. Invariably, that is the public sector, so valuefor-money analysis almost always demonstrates that the
public–private partnership is less costly.
In practice, there are no ways to know in advance if a
specific public–private partnership will be cost effective. In
effect, public–private partnerships proceed more often as a
matter of faith than experience. However, this having been
said, it is important to also note that a ‘value for money
assessment should also take into account the potential nonfinancial benefits of PPPs [public–private partnerships] such as
the accelerated and enhanced delivery of projects’.a

Ireland, 2007; a EPEC, 2012.

(Box 8.11). When the public–private partnership
was put in place in 2002, the net present value of
the 30 years long arrangement was estimated at
£15.7 billion.87 However, within just a few years, the
private sector partners went bankrupt.88 It has been
estimated that the legal and other consulting costs

Box 8.11 The use of a public–private partnership to upgrade the London Underground, UK
When the UK government decided to upgrade the London
Underground in 1997 it was decided to undertake this infrastructure upgrading as a public-private partnership. The
government believed this was a sensible move following years
of underfunding and financial instability. Furthermore, it was
also believed that while the weak management of London’s
underground led to cost and time inefficiencies, the operation
of trains had been satisfactory.
A complex public–private partnership structure was
developed, whereby the three public–private partnership
consortia were set up to carry out different parts of the
maintenance and rehabilitation of the underground infrastructure. The public sector retained ownership and responsibility
for the delivery of transportation services.
Specific and carefully written contracts meant that the
infrastructure ‘companies’ (infracos) would be fully invested
through performance-based incentives and penalties, tied to
the specifications of the contracts. To account for possible
unanticipated costs, as a result of age of the metro system, a
public arbiter was appointed to adjudicate claims for such
unforeseen costs during the maintenance and renewal of train
systems. Provisions were also made for a periodic review of
contractual arrangements every 7.5 years.
However, the project was at a disadvantage from the
outset as infracos used private capital to finance the

public–private partnership that was to be repaid through the
annual loan payments made by the government. This was a
more costly option as the cost of private borrowing was
greater than raising capital through public bonds. In addition
private lenders demanded a public guarantee of 95 per cent on
their loans. Thus, as the risk borne by lenders was minimal,
there was little or no incentive to review the efficiency of
infracos or hold them accountable for the use of the money
given to them. If the project failed, which it eventually did, risk
fell upon the public sector.
Two major problems undermined this public–private
partnership agreement. The first was the fragmentation of
operations and construction between public and private
partners. The infracos were seeking to carry out work that
maximized their profits but didn’t necessarily address London
Underground’s mission of service delivery. Construction
work, for example, was continually carried out at inconvenient
times. The second problem was the lack of coordination and
fragmentation between the two main consortiums involved.
This resulted in inefficient implementation, without a clear
corporate governance structure. In hindsight it may thus be
said that the long-term survival of this project was doomed
from the outset.

involved in designing the structure for this public–
private partnership amounted to almost £500
million.89 Between these start-up transactions costs
and losses caused by guarantees to private banks, plus
cost overruns on the contracts, it is estimated that
this public–private partnership cost UK taxpayers over
£2 billion of unnecessary loss, and left London with
a large number of subway stations in various states
of disrepair. This was the result of a ‘deal that was
forced on their city by the central government . . .
And this is just the beginning: costs for the City of
London are . . . expected to grow by an additional
£1 billion’.90
As a result of the care put into constructing
the public–private partnership model, this project
exemplifies the forethought required to implement
such major urban transport public works via public–
private partnerships. At the same time, the fact that
this 30-year project was completely dissolved one
quarter of the way through, in 2010, also makes it
an important cautionary experience about the
inherent limits of such an approach to major public
works. Presently the refurbishment of the London
Underground is proceeding as an in-house project of
transport for London, the London Underground’s
parent agency. All indications are that it is generally
proceeding on time and on budget.91
This London experience is instructive on several
levels:
• It demonstrates the problems that arise when the
public and private partners have different perceptions of the mission.
• It demonstrates the fact that the start-up costs of
establishing a public–private partnership – in
terms of consultant and operating costs – can be
much higher than expected when these processes
begin. These transaction costs are typically either
ignored or badly underestimated when the
public–private partnership is being designed and
politically promoted.
• One of the promises of bringing in private partners to manage public infrastructure is that they
will introduce new and innovative technology.
Although that can happen in some cases, in
general once contracts are signed, entities (be they
public or private) become risk averse and seek to
protect profits from assured revenue streams.
• Finally, it demonstrates that even when there is
an attempt to overcome the problems of incomplete contracting with highly specified contract
terms, in regard to deliverables, dates and penalty
clauses, the problem of contract compliance
becomes a serious impediment.
The most important lesson from this experience is
that the simpler and clearer the terms of engagement
in a public–private partnership are, the more likely
it is for the public sector to achieve its goals.

When public–private partnerships fail, they
always do so for reasons unique to the individual
situation. This leads to a temptation to say that the
next effort will avoid those problems and everything
will go as planned. Indeed international consulting
firms publish ‘how to’ guides in which they state that
there is a need for knowledge and transparency all
around.92 However, the underlying generic problem
is that public–private partnerships, if they are dealing
with significant urban transport challenges, are
dealing with situations in which information is always
incomplete and future situations uncertain and
changing.

Combination models
Finance for most urban transport systems is typically
a combination of sources that resemble value capture
in some aspects and general revenue funding
approaches in others. It is likely that for most systems
some combination of these along with direct user
charges is the most realistic financial arrangements.
The specific financial structure of any particular
system will depend greatly on the historic context
in which it operates and local norms and values with
regard to the structure of the public sector. The
challenge is to understand how models that combine
elements of user and public revenues can successfully
operate in practice. This section reviews experiences from New York and India.
The New York Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (MTA) provides an example of ways in
which diverse revenue sources can be collected by a
single agency and focused on providing a multi-modal
regional transport system (Box 8.12). The agency relies
on a diverse mix of revenues from federal, state and
local governments and a collection of taxes earmarked
for transportation. Lastly, the revenue surplus from
tolls on bridges and tunnels is an important part of the
MTA finances and an implicit cross-subsidy from car
and truck users to public transport customers.
The attractiveness of New York’s regionally and
modally integrated urban transport system is that it
facilitates an easy distribution of costs and revenues
across modes. This in turn provides a potentially easily
used policy tool with which to encourage the pursuit
of a sustainable urban mobility system. However, it
is important to understand that timing and institutional context matter greatly. The first decade of the
New York experience was fraught with many political
difficulties, as each agency fought to protect its
existing autonomy within the new organizational
format. Hence while the model provides some
promise for the potential of integration and movement towards a true ‘urban transport system’, it also
requires strong governmental administrative capacity
and dedication to succeed.
Responding to the poor quality of public transport in India, the Government of India is actively

Box 8.12 Multiple funding sources: The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, US
New York has one of the oldest and largest urban transport
systems in the world and its evolution over the past century is
instructive in terms of how metropolitan systems can adapt
over time to multiple funding streams. In 1968, New York
State consolidated the administration and financing of all
transport infrastructure and rolling stock in the metropolitan
region into a single transport agency, the MTA. The main
motivation for this administrative consolidation was to
consolidate the planning and finances for all modes.
The MTA is responsible for regional transport for an
area extending over 130,000 square kilometres and containing
a population of about 20 million. The responsibilities include
New York City’s metro system comprised of both elevated
and subway lines and fixed-route bus system, suburban buses,
Long Island Railroad, Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Bus
and the principal bridges and tunnels that carry car and truck
traffic in and around the region.
As metro fares cover only 60 per cent of operations,
other revenue sources are required. The MTA collects tolls
on its bridges and tunnels too, but incomes are still insufficient.

As a result, the State of New York permits the MTA to derive
other revenues from four different taxes:
•
•
•

•

a small (0.25 per cent) tax on all transactions in the 12
counties of the MTA region;
a regional franchise tax levied on certain business
activities;
a transportation-oriented tax called the ‘long lines tax’,
which is levied on trucking, telegraph and
telecommunications companies;
a ‘petroleum business tax’, which is levied on refining or
selling petroleum state-wide.

The first two of these are regional taxes, which provide the
majority of non-fare revenue operating funds. Such taxes are,
however, not good sources of stable funding, as they are highly
sensitive to fluctuations in the economy during recessionary
times. The last two taxes are imposed state-wide, and as a
result, the MTA gets only a portion of them: 48 per cent of the
long lines revenue and 55 per cent of the petroleum tax.

Box 8.13 Funding of public transport investments: Lessons from Delhi and Ahmedabad, India
India’s National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) explicitly
shifted the focus of transport policy away from reactive
congestion relief through road and highway expansion to the
proactive promotion of non-motorized transport and
improvement of public transport systems. NUTP is funded
under the seven-year (2005–2011) JnNURM, which provided
centrally financed grants to urban transport projects in specific
cities that complied with NUTP guidelines. The Janmarg BRT
in Ahmedabad and the Delhi Metro (Phase II) are among the
first projects funded under this programme.
At the level of practice, several key principles for
investing in economically sustainable urban transport development can be extracted from this experience. These include:
•

•

Local buy-in: Both Janmarg and Delhi Metro demonstrate
the importance of local ownership of projects. Political
commitment at all levels is vital to implementation success,
but local-level buy-in – particularly at the agency and
bureaucratic level – is also essential. Local ownership can
generate cost savings through better utilization of local
resources, and improves the responsiveness of the design
and construction process to local conditions. A firm belief
by local implementation teams in the benefits of their
schemes is also important in building public acceptance.
Multi-tiered financing: Financing of urban transport
systems should be multi-tiered, combining various funding
options according to the relative comparative advantages
of different funding actors and the short-term and longterm financing needs of the schemes (e.g. capital
investment versus recurrent expenditures). Delhi in

•

•

•

•

particular was effective in drawing in alternative financing
options from a variety of international, national, state and
local stakeholders.
Dedicated agency: The creation of a single purpose
agency to implement and operate public transport
schemes minimized the need for coordination across
multiple agencies. However, under this arrangement extra
care needs to be taken to ensure proper integration with
other modes of mobility.
Incremental implementation: There are both physical
and financial advantages to carefully planned, incremental
implementation. Pay-offs include improved design, time
savings, cost savings through feedback and modification as
well as greater public acceptance and increased ridership.
Ahmedabad provided a particularly effective example of
this.
Innovative technology: Technology can play an important
role in public acceptance of a scheme. Modern
communication and ticketing technology has the potential
to greatly facilitate integration of different modes of
transport. But the value of ‘modernization’ also lies in its
visual association with cleanliness, safety and comfort.
This is particularly important in developing countries
where aspirations for modernization are often
synonymous with the use of private cars (or motorbikes).
Affordability/equity: Affordable fares are absolutely
critical and should never be sacrificed in a quest for financial cost recovery.

promoting sustainable urban transport development,
formalized in the National Urban Transport Policy
(of 2006), through the use of strong financial incentives targeted at local governments. The Janmarg
BRT and Delhi Metro projects present two alternative responses to this new policy (Box 8.13). Although
they differ in terms of scale, mode and specific
approaches, the different solutions made by the two
projects reflect similar common successful principles
for financing sustainable urban mobility systems.
The two Indian projects illustrate the ways in
which national governments can organize finance to
stimulate local investments in urban public transport.
Both cases show how supportive national policies,
accompanied by financial incentives, can play a critical
role in the adoption and implementation of more
sustainable forms of urban transport. Furthermore,
both experiences were backed by significant grant
contributions towards capital costs. The experiences
demonstrate the importance of inter-governmental
cooperation and the need for a clear local public
authority over the operation of public transport
systems.93
Overall, there is an important lesson here
concerning the need to ensure that – as a general
rule of thumb – operating costs should be tied to
fares, but capital costs need a broader source of
revenues, a source that relates to the broader access
values that the system creates. The MTRC in Hong
Kong provides a good example of this (Box 8.7).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY

Schemes that
successfully
permit urban
transport to be
supported by the
value of the
access that they
create can provide
a strong basis for
sustainable urban
mobility

In order to be sustainable, urban mobility systems
must be organized by a financial model that is
designed to protect the important public goods aspect
of public transport. As the experiences recounted in
this chapter make clear, there is a wide and flexible range of ways in which these models can be
organized. However, there is no simple ‘best-practice’
approach to designing such financial models. Instead,
one should look beyond the individual experiences
and look for principles that can be replicated in
another setting. This section presents seven principles that should inform the evolution of sustainable urban transport finance.
The goal of an urban mobility system, as a public
good, is to promote access and not mobility.
Mobility is merely one means to the achievement of
that larger end. Consequently, policies should reflect
the value of access and not the time saved through
enhanced mobility systems.
High-density and mixed-use locations reduce
the need for mobility and provide access through
co-location of important urban activities. In terms

of modal options, it is important that these be integrated so that users can move easily from one
mode to another. For example, park-and-ride lots
at the periphery of a dense urban settlement can
allow travellers to easily leave cars and enter public
transport for the final legs of journeys into these
places.
An urban area with good public transport is
more likely to also have urban spaces conducive to
pedestrian access and non-motorized transport. Only
public transport developed as a public good
can make this happen. Once that is in place, the
challenges from private motorized transport are
reduced to a point where they are practically solvable.
Urban public transport should aim to be a
high-quality service. An urban public transport
system that is viewed largely as a system for the use
of the poor quickly becomes a poor system. If government is seeking to induce car drivers to use public
transport, it is important that the alternative be safe,
reliable, comfortable and plentiful. A system used by
residents from all walks of life is a system that is
politically (as well as economically) sustainable.
Cities should strive towards full cost pricing
for cars. Cars do not pay prices that match the full
value of the economic and social costs that they
impose in the pursuit of access. Revenues collected
via congestion pricing and licensing fees should
reflect the costs that private car use imposes on urban
life. However, it is both short sighted and ineffective
to attempt to sustain public transport systems via
monies raised by car-based charges. These monies
alone will almost never be sufficient to allow for the
creation and financial sustainability of high-quality
urban public transport.
Schemes that successfully permit urban transport to be supported by the value of the access that
they create can provide a strong basis for sustainable urban mobility. Value capture can be done via
real estate taxes that reflect the value of location
as well as through complex land investments. The
more exclusive and high density the modes of travel,
such as rail and BRT, the higher will be the captureable values. Furthermore, in terms of land use, the
closer the places of residence and other activities are
to terminals, the higher values and volume of use
can be expected. Value capture does not work as well
on more ordinary bus routes or in places where car
use is already very high and/or where populations are
stagnant or shrinking.
Good public transport requires a capable
public sector. The debate about the relative
efficiency of public and private agents in the
production of public transport has been an irrelevant
distraction. Regardless of organizational form, the key
to success in creating effective urban mobility systems
is always a capable public governing authority
operating in a transparent manner.

7 It should here be noted that
the number of car registrations
may overstate the number of
cars in regular use. Individuals
may use public transportation
for daily trips and still own cars
that they use only occasionally.
Residents of cities with highquality public transport systems,
amenable land uses, and tolls
or congestion charges (such as
in Stockholm, Sweden, for
example) may own cars, but
may not use those cars for their
journeys to work or other
regular travel.

63 Typically, advocates for raising
the cost of car usage also argue
for transferring the revenues
received to public transport.
While this is a reasonable step,
it has never been demonstrated
that these revenues alone are
sufficient to address the full
costs of adequately enhanced
public transport. Furthermore,
by only going that far in policy
terms, these advocates avoid
the more politically charged
but still underlying substantive
issues of urban equity.

69 It is import to note that this
problem is endemic to passenger transport in general and not
to urban public transport in
particular. Intercity passenger
rail systems do not cover full
costs through fares. Individual
airlines do make profits on
individual routes, though even
these are not steady. Profits
fluctuate with fuel costs and
business cycles. Most
importantly, the air traffic
control system, on which
individual private routes depend,
is publicly maintained.

discussion of the role of official
development assistance and
foreign direct investments for
the financing of urban transport,
although this may play an
increasing role in the future.
‘A global development

flow of longer-term investment,
including FDI [foreign direct
investment], to a greater
number of developing countries
and into critical sectors such
as transport’ (UN System Task
Team on the Post-2015 UN
Development Agenda, 2013,
p10). However, from an
analytical point of view, such
finance should be considered
primarily as direct public
allocation, subject to
considerations beyond the

CHAPTER

INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNANCE
FOR URBAN MOBILITY
Institutional and governance frameworks are the
structures through which political, technical and
financial decisions are translated into resource
allocation and priority setting for implementing urban
mobility plans, programmes and projects. No matter
how good the policy recommendations, their implementation is dependent upon how fit-for-purpose
these institutional and governance frameworks are
to direct, manage, resource and deliver them. Visions
of sustainable urban mobility cannot be translated
into plans, nor can plans be successfully implemented, without addressing the very sustainability
of the key organizations involved and their institutional and governance frameworks.
Institutional and governance frameworks and
their related networks are critical to how well (and
how fast) urban transport infrastructure and services
are planned, appraised, delivered and operated. They
are also essential to how well joined-up urban mobility
planning is with land-use developments, and how
consistent both are with the declared goals of sustainable development.
In many cities, formal institutions that affect
the transport sector frequently operate in a less than
desirable manner. This is particularly the case in
developing countries. Notwithstanding this, people
and goods continue to circulate, and indeed in many
cases traffic continues to rise. The issue here,
however, is with what suboptimum level of efficiency
is this achieved, at what opportunity cost and at
whose cost does this growth take place?
The chapter starts with a clarification of the main
terms used in the discussion of urban mobility
institutions and governance. This is followed by a
regional review of current conditions and trends of
institutional and governance developments that affect
urban mobility policy-making, planning and management and ultimately, many aspects of urban land-use
developments. A number of key institutional and
governance challenges and underlying influences
facing cities are then drawn from this review. The
chapter also contains a discussion of policy responses

to these challenges, with some detailed examples
drawn from good practice. It ends with concluding
remarks and lessons for policy makers.

UNDERSTANDING
INSTITUTIONAL AND
GOVERNANCE
FRAMEWORKS FOR URBAN
MOBILITY
The interaction of the institutional structure and
agency actors is characterized by both formal
dimensions (i.e. rules and laws) and informal dimensions (i.e. customs and traditions), which impact
relations between different branches of government.1
In some instances, there are institutions (such as
trade unions, city chambers of commerce and
industrial lobbying groups) that – although not
formally part of the urban transport decision-making
processes – possess varying degrees of influence. The
extent they do reflects their political influence and
often the power of their purse. Enlightened institutional and governance frameworks seek to make these
influences transparent.
Well-functioning institutions and a high level of
political support are essential for creating and
maintaining good quality infrastructure and services
for urban mobility.2 Urban mobility is also impacted
by parties from outside the transport sector associated
with land use and social and environmental impacts.
In developing countries in particular, powerful nonspecialist stakeholders can exert influences that
seriously undermine efforts at achieving integrated
development between urban movement and land
use.3
The practice of policy-making and planning for
urban mobility generally rests with institutions at the
level of an urban area. However, as this may not
coincide with the administrative boundary of the

dominant city, organizations at a national (and sometimes regional/provincial) government level also set
frameworks that can significantly influence policies
that are (and are not) adopted.4 These influence the
extent of the institutional integration of transport
modes in an urban area, as well as the arrangements for their integration with other sectors. This
is particularly the case with respect to land use,
emissions, climate change, safety and finance. In
some major cities of developing countries – where
national (or regional/state) governments involve
themselves extensively in urban transport policy
decisions – many problems can arise. This is so
because such levels of government are typically more
powerful and exert more influence/control over
budgets assigned to the urban level. Furthermore,
city authorities typically lack the strong management
and professional staff capabilities necessary to tackle
the challenges that confront them. As a result, while
they may be fully aware of what needs to be done,
coordination between the two levels of government
is often not easy and frequently unequal.
The role of informal structures and organizations
in the urban transport sector needs to be emphasized.
These are especially relevant to public transport,
freight movement and non-motorized transport.
Even in the well-ordered cities of many developed
countries, the informal sector and NGOs play an
increasingly important role in facilitating and encouraging sustainable urban mobility. The involvement
of such informal structures and organizations is
essential for good governance and a ‘bottom-up’
decision-making process that enables all stakeholders
to participate. In the case of urban mobility, such
decision-making should ideally embrace all key
stakeholders involved in the provision of urban transport infrastructure and services, as well as those
impacted by decisions the sector makes.
Likewise, institutional and governance frameworks should address concerns regarding obstacles
to the effective participation of the private sector.
Thus, enabling and regulative mechanisms need to
be put in place by government to ensure that information employed to support urban transport proposals
are comprehensive, accurate, impartial and transparent.

CONDITIONS AND TRENDS
Different parts of the world have different governance structures for urban mobility delivery, with
various institutional stakeholders influencing urban
development and mobility trends. It is particularly
important to note that the policy and planning
challenges of urban mobility in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition
differ significantly from those found in urban areas
of developed countries. In general, the resources
(human, technical and financial) and institutional

frameworks at the disposal of policy-makers and
planners in such cities are typically less well developed. Thus, the sections below focus on selected
conditions and trends of institutional developments
and governance, and their underlying influences, in
developed countries, countries with economies in
transition and developing countries.

Developed countries
The institutional and governance frameworks for
urban mobility in most of Europe reflect the
circumstances of mature developed economies and
institutional and governance arrangements. By and
large, European cities possess a well-educated interdisciplinary professional class to serve the needs of
urban mobility in particular and urban development
in general. The larger more populated countries all
have strong, multi-tier governments, as do the smaller
northern European countries. Significant differences
remain, however, particularly with respect to funding
levels, technical capacities and organizational efficiencies among many of the Southern European
countries. In these countries, institutional and
governance arrangements and technical capacities
are less well developed and resourced. There is,
nevertheless, cross-fertilization of ideas between all
these countries through numerous EU initiatives,
with some significant improvements observed.5
The city of Nantes, France, has succeeded to
integrate the decision-making agencies in and around
the city into one body.6 These arrangements provide
various capabilities with the agency responsible for
highway and public spaces, housing, town planning
and land-use development. This body also has the
competence for all aspects of organizing public transport in the metropolitan area in which it has made
some notable advances. Since 2008, there has been
only one agency responsible for all mobility matters
in Nantes.7 This organization is ‘responsible for
strategy as well as operational management of a
whole range of aspects of sustainable mobility,
including roads and highway planning, traffic management, traffic and public road management, cycling
and parking policies, and management including all
off-street parking such as multi-storey car parks,
park and rides and other sustainable mobility services
such as car-pooling and car sharing’.8
Similar developments are currently underway in
London, where surface and underground rail systems
in the metropolitan region are increasingly integrated
as part of the Mayor’s Transport Strategy for the
Greater London Authority, which comes directly
under the office of the mayor.9
Sixty years of private car-orientated transport
infrastructure investment and suburbanization in
the US have contributed to widespread urban traffic
congestion10 and created a significant urban mobility
divide, which has seriously affected the mobility of

those who cannot afford the ownership of a private
car.11 This car dependency has been accentuated
by an institutional emphasis on the importance of
personal mobility – whether related to distances
that need to be travelled or to the general limited
availability of public transport, particularly in lowerdensity cities.12
Given the history of motorization in the US,
it is perhaps unexpected that the country has
introduced legislation seeking to introduce a revolution in the way urban transportation investments are
planned and implemented.13 This legislation looked
to a hierarchy of supporting transportation plans and
programmes introduced and carried out by metropolitan planning organizations in cooperation with
states for major urban areas. However, the act does
not give these planning organizations any new legal
authority in this area. Instead it emphasises ‘partnerships’ between all relevant agencies, in order to
promote area-wide interests and goals.14
In Canada, the federal government acknowledges that insufficient funding, accompanied by
fragmented planning and implementation of urban
mobility systems and related land use, are the major
obstacles to establishing efficient urban transportation networks.15 As a result, the Greater Toronto
Transportation Agency was set up. This provided ‘the
governance mechanism to plan, fund and deliver
integrated transportation and related land use for the
entire urban region comprehensively and consistently
over time’.16 Similarly in Vancouver, the governance
structure for urban transport attempts to coordinate and achieve integration and a balance between
different modes. To this end the Government of
British Columbia created TransLink to assume many
transportation responsibilities previously held by
the provincial government (in 1998). TransLink is
responsible for the regional transportation network
of Metro Vancouver in British Columbia, including
public transport and major roads and bridges.17
Australia has a federal governance structure,
with responsibility for the integration of land use and
transport largely resting with state and local governments. Although all recent major transport infrastructure investments in its main cities have been
made within the same federal institutional context,
the responses to urban mobility challenges have
been quite diverse.18 In the city of Perth, transport
and land-use planning portfolios reside within the
Western Australian Department of Planning and
Infrastructure, which has its own minister in the
state government. Public transport is the responsibility of the Public Transport Authority, a government
agency whose responsibilities cover public transport
(bus, train and ferry services) in Perth and regional
centres. Two other agencies (Main Roads and
Department of Transport) are responsible for other
transport matters (i.e. major and minor roads, transport safety, etc.).19

New Zealand has seen several new developments in the institutional and governance structure
of its major cities. From the perspective of the integration of urban transport, ‘the restructuring of
metropolitan Auckland is one of the most substantial
and far-reaching local government restructurings in
recent years. [It offers a] unique governance framework for local authorities’ to manage council-controlled organizations.20 The capital city of Wellington
has also employed a regional approach to the planning
and delivery of its transport infrastructure and
services.21

Countries with economies in transition
Democratization, privatization and decentralization
have been the three main institutional change
processes occurring in countries that emerged from
communism in Central and Eastern Europe. At the
end of communist rule in the early 1990s, these
countries had strong, centralized decision-making
systems, and a tradition of state planning of urban
land use and transportation. They also had a relatively
well-educated professional class working in secure
formal institutions, a dominance of public transport
over private car use, and a relatively deferential civil
society.22
With democratization, the strength of influence of different stakeholders changed. The voice of
the citizenry became more fragmented, as wealthier
residents abandoned their dependency on public
transport systems. At the same time, many public
transport operators found themselves unable to
extend their service to low-density developments on
the periphery. Operators simultaneously suffered
from drastic reductions of subsidies that made public
transport more expensive to provide and unaffordable
to many potential users.23 The sharp reductions in
government subsidies in Poland, for example, forced
public transport services to raise fares drastically.
Meanwhile, under-spending led to poorer public
transport services, lower operational efficiencies and
a reduction in public transport hardware and related
infrastructure investment. This resulted in a gap
developing between revenue and expenditure to a
point that became exceedingly difficult to bridge.24
Privatization and neoliberal influences have
resulted in much more complex institutional decisionmaking developments. Together with the absence
of an understanding of how market forces operate,
there has been an (unintentional) gradual undermining of economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability by governments, as a result of
their extending the time between plan-making and
implementation.
Decentralization – in the form of transfer of
responsibility for regional and local infrastructure and
public transport services to provincial and local
governments – has in some cases been excessive.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

In the case of Poland, ‘the State has gone too far in
decentralizing all public transport responsibilities to
the cities and has not faced squarely the complicated
issues related to urban roads’ and traffic issues.25
The situation in Russia and many other countries (e.g.
Latvia, Lithuania) is similar. Here the municipal
sector has remained fragmented and suffers from
poor administrative capacity, which has contributed
to weak cooperation between independent local
governments. This is particularly harmful in efforts
to address transport problems in metropolitan areas
where good cooperation between central city and
suburban municipal governments is crucial.26

Developing countries
In most of Africa,
. . . the fact that
(too) many
ministries are
involved in the
urban transport
sector at the local
level contributes
to actions that
can prove
contradictory

In most developing countries, urban transport institutions and governance systems have been unable
to keep pace with growth in urban population and
mobility needs. The urban transport sector is characterized by its rapid motorization, deficient public
transport supply, informality in its mobility systems,
congestion, pollution and high traffic fatalities – with
differentiated impacts, in different cities and between
trip-makers (according to income groups, gender, age,
disability and level of education).27
n

Africa

In most of Africa, and notwithstanding positive
developments – such as the setting up the Executive
Council of Urban Transport in Dakar, Senegal (Box
9.1), the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority in Nigeria (Box 9.14), and the introduction of
coordinated urban mobility plans in South Africa28 –
poor coordination between the numerous institutions
in urban transport prevail. This has led to problems
in developing unified and integrated urban mobility
policies. The fact that (too) many ministries are
involved in the urban transport sector at the local
level contributes to actions that can prove contra-

dictory. There is also a widespread underfunding of
urban public transport and rarely any significant
formal involvement of transport users (or civil society)
in the governance of cities. This is reflective of the
widespread absence of decentralization in the transport sector, which remains controlled by national
governments. In countries such as Senegal or Burkina
Faso, for example, urban transport is not included
in the sectors concerned by the decentralization
process.29 In the case of Egypt, efforts to centralize
responsibilities for urban transport have recently
taken place in greater Cairo where a Public Transportation Regulatory Authority was established by
presidential decree in 2012, to control all urban transport modes in the city.30

Latin America and the Caribbean

The institutional and governance frameworks in
the field of urban land use and transport in Latin
America and the Caribbean are strongly influenced
by those of developed countries (particularly,
North America).31 Apart from some urban highway
investments, the major new institutional initiatives
in the region relate to efforts to formalize public transport modes and to improve formal public transport
services through the introduction of new BRT systems
and metro extensions. As noted in previous chapters,
‘cities like Curitiba, Brazil, have a long history in
implementing innovative and integrated forms of
transport. Bogotá and Medellin in Colombia are
continuously incorporating new and increasingly
participative forms of transport decisions’.32
However, in Santiago, Chile, ‘urban transportation is managed through a disparate and fragmented institutional framework, distributed among
public institutions of distinct levels with distinct
areas of responsibility . . . structured across . . . three
. . . levels of government’ involving several agencies
at each level.33 Santiago’s 2000–2010 urban mobility
plan was prepared in response to this disparate and

Box 9.1 The Executive Council of Urban Transport (CETUD), in Dakar, Senegal
CETUD was established to resolve the dispersion of
jurisdiction between various central and local institutions
concerned by urban transport in Dakar, and to coordinate
urban transport policy-making. CETUD has been assigned the
following responsibilities:
•

•

•
•

Decide which routes to be served, the corresponding
authorization quotas for public transport and their
technical operating terms.
Prepare ‘call for tender’ documents, sign agreements with
the registered transporters and control implementation of
contracts.
Propose tariff policies to the appropriate authorities.
Identify the constraints of the public service and determine
the relative financial compensation.

•
•
•

•

•

Develop criteria for admission to the profession of public
transporters.
Implement studies and initiatives for training, information
and promotion for urban public transport.
Coordinate the different types of public transport; and in
particular, arbitrate the division of profits in the case of
tariff integration.
Develop and support the creation of shares and
investment programmes to improve infrastructure, traffic
and road safety services.
Improve the condition and quality of the transport fleet to
reduce pollution.

fragmented institutional set-up (Box 9.7). Comprised
of 12 programmes, one included the modernization
of the public transport system and the coordination
and integration of decisions relating to urban development and transport – known as Transantiago.34
This programme sought the creation of a new
institutional, operational and legal framework for an
urban public transport system that restructured the
bus network on a trunk-feeder basis. It was not,
however, assigned the necessary executive powers,
nor was it adequately resourced.35
n

Western Asia

The institutional and governance structures for
urban transport in Western Asia are as diverse as
the different governance systems found there. Notwithstanding the differences, ‘a decentralized model
of urban transport governance appears to be emerging
. . . throughout the region, as a result of recent
decentralization reforms related to rapid urbanization’.36
Oil-rich countries, including the Gulf States and
Saudi Arabia, confront urban land-use and transport
developments spawned by dramatic increases in
affluence. This wealth has enabled their governments to develop urban transportation systems similar to those found in developed countries. This has
been accompanied by the establishment of some wellresourced, sophisticated new institutional and government frameworks for urban mobility, such as the
Urban Planning Council in the United Arab Emirates.
Populous countries, such as Turkey and Iran, are
much less well-resourced. They have weaker and
more stressed institutional capacities. Poorer countries, such as Yemen, have inadequately developed
institutions for urban mobility, more akin to those
of the poorer parts of South Asia or Sub-Saharan
Africa.37
Within Western Asia, it is common that competition or rivalry prevail between government
agencies responsible for different aspects of urban
transport and land-use development. A frequent
response to such challenges is for government to

create independent public agencies devoted to the
planning and delivery of projects. In Istanbul, for
example, there are several such dedicated urban
transport authorities whose responsibilities are not
well integrated and often compete.38

South Asia

The institutional frameworks for urban transport
and land-use development in cities of South Asia
generally exhibit a strong multi-tier set of national,
regional and local government plus quasi-government institutions, accompanied by a significant
growth of private-sector transport operators and
investors. With fast-growing demand for urban mobility in the region, transport institutions in cities face
a host of challenges (Box 9.2). Such institutions are
largely geared to address formal traffic and transport
concerns, leaving informal and non-motorized modes
to fend for themselves.39 The lateral links between
the institutions – in functional as well as geographical
terms – are typically poor compared to their vertical institutional links. So much so, that ‘it is being
increasingly realized that the gap between planning
and implementation can not be bridged without the
institutional reorganization, capacity building and
streamlining of the procedures’.40
However, in several Indian cities – including
Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Chennai and
Bangalore – unified metropolitan traffic and transport authorities have been set up (Figure 9.1).41

South-Eastern Asia

South-Eastern Asia presents a very mixed picture in
terms of institutional development and governance
for urban transport. This is due to the very different
forms and levels of governments that prevail, their
different colonial histories and subsequent evolution
of their political processes.42 It is, however, common
that many of the responsibilities related to urban
movement in the region are entrusted to a range of
different national ministries, as in the case of Jakarta,
Indonesia.43
In Thailand and the Philippines, strong regional
political differences complicate the situation for
transport ministries attempting to work with city
governments. Manila’s institutional arrangements
have remained virtually unchanged for generations.
Although the Metro Manila Development Authority

metro system and other public transport infrastructure, in accordance with the
provisions of the concept plans.

In terms of possessing institutional arrangements
that enhance the integration of land use and
transportation, as well as the integration of modes
within the transport sector, Singapore is perhaps
the exception in South-Eastern Asia. Much of the
effectiveness of this integration ‘is greatly assisted
by [Singapore’s] two key agencies for planning and
policy, namely: the [Urban Regional Authority] . . .
for spatial development and land use, and the [Land
Transport Authority] . . . for all modes of transport’45

Eastern Asia

In Eastern Asia, the influence of the strong institutional and governance frameworks for urban
mobility in Hong Kong and Singapore has been
particularly noticeable in mainland China.46 Table
9.1 summarizes three main institutional models for
the management of urban mobility in mainland
China.
Strong political support for key urban transportation projects has helped achieve some aspects
of long-term policy-making and planning in China.
Tensions, however, exist in some instances between
central and local interests, as well as between public
and private sector interests. On occasion, these have
prevented the emergence of an integrated institutional approach to land-use and transport development.47

local professional cadres there are several prom-

ising innovations in urban-mobility planning in
China. Shanghai exemplifies this with its rationalization of urban land-use and mobility management
structures. Here urban transport and related land-use
development functions are divided among three
departments: the Urban Planning Bureau; the UrbanRural Construction and Transport Committee; and
the Traffic Police Headquarters (Figure 9.2). Rail and
water transport – which are highly significant in
most Chinese cities – however, are usually outside
of city control and are administered regionally or at
the state level.48

CHALLENGES AND
UNDERLYING INFLUENCES
This section describes the main challenges and
underlying influences related to urban transport
institutions and governance worldwide. These have
been organized below under four main categories,
namely challenges of adaptation; administration and
governance; mobility policy, plan-making, management and regulation; and resourcing and capacitybuilding. Even though the challenges are presented
below as separate themes, it is important to appreciate the interconnectivity among them. For example,
the challenge posed by fragmented decision-making
applies virtually across all themes.

Adaptation challenges
There is a slow-growing acceptance among governments (and many other stakeholders) of the need
to change institutions and governance if sustainable mobility goals are to be delivered. The acceptance of this need for transformation varies greatly in
different cultural and development contexts, and
between countries, cities, as well as different levels
of government. There are, however, major deficiencies in the establishment of this capacity for change,

and in understanding how to change. The transformation implies embracing a broad definition of
‘governance’ and managing the demand for movement that favours vulnerable and disadvantaged
groups and the environment.49
The increased globalization and politicization of the environmental debate brings
challenges that can have major local manifestations.
Where manifestations are negative this generates
tensions, which have influenced the thinking of
many urban mobility stakeholders, as well as those
engaged in urban land-use policy and planning. There
are many examples of urban transportation policy
documents that express what changes need to occur
and how ‘smart growth’ can propel more sustainable
urban mobility planning.50 The degree to which this
has resulted in action, however, has been limited due
to the resistance to change within many institutions.
Successful implementation of programmes based on
more holistic thinking typically requires strong
political leadership. Without such leadership, aspirations of more holistic thinking tend to flounder.51
There is increasing recognition that the integration of land-use and transport planning is
necessary to ensure the efficiency of urban mobility
systems.52 However, it is important to recognize the
commonalities as well as differences between the
nature and roles of participants in both fields, as well
as the limits to integration possible between the two
(Box 9.4).53 The issue is not so much the difference
in perspective, but rather the influence and power
that accompanies these perspectives and their ability
to affect outcomes. Consultations in land-use developments are more about proposed one-time changes
of use, whereas changes to urban mobility tend to
take place on a continuous basis. Land-use planning
may, as a result, require structural changes in institutional and governance frameworks of a more permanent kind than for urban transportation.54
In developing countries, where urban land
ownership and management policy and participatory

Box 9.4 Key challenges in integrated land-use and transport planning
As transportation is a function of land use, one way of
effectively reducing urban movement is by imposing tighter
land-use controls and increasing densities. There are,
however, a number of problems that can prevent this from
materializing:
•

•

Many agencies that influence and/or regulate land use have
little or no responsibility for mobility policies. The result is
a serious institutional ‘land-use/transportation disconnect’
that prevents integrative actions, especially in cities that
have a weak tradition of urban land-use planning and
control.
The skill-sets required by the two principal professions
involved are very different and employ very different

•

•

premises and logic. Obliging these professions to
employ more joined-up thinking, as required in transitorientated development projects, is a good way of
achieving this.
Competitive forces among cities often have one city
pitching against another, encouraging ‘sweetener deals’
to potential major investors in the form of exceptions
and leniency in land-use policies and development
control.
Urban growth can prove impervious to local public
policies.

processes are generally less well developed,55
there is typically a lack of consultation in both urban
land-use and mobility planning. There is, nonetheless, an increased understanding of the close links
between urban mobility and land-use planning as a
result of the land-value impact of transport infrastructure on land use.56 These circumstances call for a
more holistic approach to urban mobility planning,
irrespective of cultural and development contexts.

Of all challenges
confronted by
efforts to promote
integrated urban
land-use and
mobility planning,
perhaps the most
corrosive is a bias
against integrated
planning and
management

As earlier indicated, democratization, privatization
and decentralization have been the three main
challenges to the institutional changes occurring
in Eastern Europe during the last two decades.57 The
abandonment or gradual dismantling of previous
centralized decision-making and planning has transformed the functions of many key transportation
infrastructures and services. Meanwhile, the earlier
dominance of public transport over private car use
has been reversed. This has spawned new urbanization and motorization challenges at a scale not seen
before. Similar developments can also be found in
some developing countries. This has brought new
challenges reflecting changes in the types and
influences of stakeholders involved in urban infrastructure developments and provision of transport
services. Together with the advance of privatization
and neoliberal influences, such developments have
produced more complex institutional decision-making
arrangements, particularly with regard to transport
infrastructure and service investment deliveries
associated with private-finance initiatives and
public–private partnerships.58
Urban growth generally results in cities spilling
over beyond their original administrative boundaries
– absorbing neighbouring settlements in a greater
metropolitan area. The discussion in the previous
section illustrates the complications associated
with urban administrative boundaries, when
rail- and road-based transport services extend well
beyond city boundaries into their hinterland as intercity carriers for passengers and goods. Thus decisionmaking is not only fragmented as a result overlapping institutional responsibilities; it also faces
major challenges in terms of horizontal coordination between lower tier governments and, more
significantly, in terms of vertical integration.59 The
identification of a lead authority to provide strategic
direction in decision-making is thus a pre-requisite
of coordinated action.
Changes in organizational arrangements of
agencies are frequently made to address urban
mobility challenges. Such changes are particularly
made when a new administration comes to power,
either at the national or municipal level. These changes, however, have too often acquired a reputation for

doing little more than ‘moving the boxes around’
on an organizational chart and renaming them. This
negative perception of organizational reform can
be attributed to: a failure to improve organizational
culture; a failure in business processes; and a failure
in staff skills development. To achieve effective organizational change, all three need to be tackled together.
Of all challenges confronted by efforts to
promote integrated urban land-use and mobility
planning, perhaps the most corrosive is a bias against
integrated planning and management. This bias
is encountered within many institutions (both public
and private). While it is apparent that joined-up
thinking and actions are prerequisites to the successful pursuit of sustainable development outcomes,
there is growing evidence to suggest that severe
tensions emerge in contexts that also promote neoliberal free market ‘solutions’ to public domain
problems. This is because free-market advocates
frequently view integrated planning and management as synonymous to top-down comprehensive
planning and management – which restricts innovation and is potentially wasteful due to its noncompetitive high transaction costs.

Mobility policy, plan-making, management
and regulatory challenges
The mainstreaming of the mobility needs of the
socially and economically disadvantaged is a
major challenge, and includes gender concerns, as
well as the needs of the disabled, the elderly,
children and youth.60 As noted in Chapter 6,
the challenges relate to their dependence on nonmotorized movement, their restricted access to
motorized public and private transport (especially
on grounds of affordability and their capacity restrictions), their vulnerability to traffic accidents, and other
safety and security concerns. Addressing these issues
requires extensive investigations to better ascertain
the nature, distribution and scale of these concerns,
to provide a basis for deciding how best to improve
the future design, management and delivery of
public transport services, including for security
enforcement.
The issue of how best to plan, manage,
operate and regulate urban public transport –
and the extent this involves enterprise operator
functions for building the needed roads or railways
or operating buses – is a major international challenge, especially where non-nationalized models of
public transport governance exist. Some stakeholders
advocate that these enterprises must over time be
transformed into self-sustaining businesses operating
on commercial lines.61 Other stakeholders, however,
do not consider it desirable (or inevitable) that public
transport should always be commercially operated,
and look to a more welfare-orientated approach
instead.62

In addition to the kinds of formal urban public
transport systems referred to above, informal
public transport services ply the roads of many (if
not most) cities of developing countries. While
some urban institutional arrangements show some
accommodation toward informal sector operators, the
culture of city officials throughout developing
countries is typically dismissive of informal modes
of mobility. This is despite the widespread prevalence
of poverty in cities with a large majority of inhabitants
for whom these modes of travel are vital.63
Freight movement is critical to the economies
of all cities. There is thus an ongoing call for increased
private investments to address the needs of freight
movement, in terms of infrastructure and operations.
Although significant world-wide, such investment is
particularly important for cities with major ports
and/or airline hubs in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, where globalization has opened up many new opportunities.
Private investment in freight movement has seen
major developments in information and communications technologies, which in turn have spawned
dramatic changes to logistic services in the continued
search to reduce costs.
A major challenge to freight movement in
metropolitan areas of developing countries has to do
with the location of logistics facilities, and the
unpredictability of changes to land uses resulting from
the absence of land-use zoning protection of existing logistic centres. This has led many freight
companies to move their logistic facilities to the
periphery, where land is cheaper and more freely
available.64 Such developments have contributed to
a growing ‘logistics sprawl’ of freight logistic and
distribution centres.
Challenges of multi-modal integration are
numerous and varied in urban areas globally. They
are exceedingly important with respect to provision
of efficient public transport and freight movement.
A common challenge for urban institutions is the
integration of the planning, management and operation of railways with road-based public transport
services and other traffic. A larger challenge for fastgrowing cities in developing countries is the more
urgent task of facilitating convenient rail-road interchanges for peak commuter journeys and ensuring
integration of fares.
Inter-agency collaboration among the organizations responsible for the planning, management
and operation of various urban modes of transport –
and the city planning organizations responsible for
land developments – is also essential. Establishing
such collaboration is among the most fundamental challenges for municipal and government
authorities, especially where silo-thinking too often
prevails.
There is a clear need to mainstream environmental concerns65 in institutional and govern-

ance frameworks for urban mobility.66 Transport and
non-transport engineering and environmental departments tend to compete over resources, funding and
for pre-eminence within governance structures.
While the mainstreaming of transport disciplines is
a useful premise within organizational restructuring,
the transport department is often part of a bigger
engineering or environmental department that has
other priorities to balance. In practice, transport is
often given greater importance where there are
particular pressures on the availability or value of
land that constrain the distribution of people and
jobs/goods/services.

Resourcing and capacity-building
challenges
Perhaps the most pervasive challenge for urban transport institutions globally is the lack of sustained
funding for transportation infrastructure and
services – not least for the institutional infrastructure. Combined with a poor understanding of urban
economics and the complex interplay between infrastructure investment, land-use planning and the
value that the ‘public good’ of efficient mobility can
provide, these challenges together can pose ‘wicked
problems’.67 As noted in Chapter 8, cities can be selffinancing in transportation and other essential infrastructure if economic rent from land value-added
through investment in infrastructure is captured by
the city and ‘recycled’.68 However, few cities come
close to practising the theory. As a result, cities are
forced to develop plans for public transport improvements that depend overwhelmingly on the fare box
to finance fixed assets.
The development of information and
communications technologies69 can enhance the
performance of the urban transportation sector.
The fast-changing world of such technologies offers
numerous possibilities – primarily through the
internet and mobile communication – to help address
the current lack of sustained funding for urban
transportation infrastructure and services (Box 9.5).
These tools, however, are too often poorly understood and/or present numerous technological and
funding challenges (especially initially) to many
conventional civic institutions, particularly in developing countries.
This remains an important challenge as the
opportunity costs of not employing such tools mount.
In recognition of the potential for urban transport
institutions of information and communications
technologies, the United Nations has sought to
promote tools that can monitor urban land and infrastructure developments (including land values) so as
to enhance the ability of government decision-makers
to better plan, manage and finance future urban
development as part of online capacity-building
efforts.70

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Box 9.5 The potential of social media and open source material
The evolving frontier of web 2.0, social media, open source
material and volunteered geographic information needs to be
considered, addressed and potentially embraced with respect
to the development of urban mobility systems. Until relatively
recently, the public sector, the private sector, or a partnership
between the two, were responsible for planning, design,
implementation and operation of urban mobility systems, with
civil society actors being consulted at times as a routine part
of the process of planning or implementation. Engineers,
planners, bankers, architects and urban designers were the
‘professionals’ whose expertise informed transportation
efforts.
Today, however, civil society groups and individuals are
vocal advocates for, and increasingly consider themselves to be
‘experts’ in, sustainable mobility efforts. While geospatial
mobility and logistics data are largely proprietary in nature,
civil society groups and individuals request and sometimes
demand access to government-owned data sets. Furthermore,
crowd-sourced and/or volunteered geographic information
data sets are now emerging as open source alternatives to
proprietary and private data, and are increasingly seen as

Institutional capacity-building and training
of staff in the urban transport sector are always
critical, regardless of the level of development and
the gender of trainee.71 These efforts are frequently
required for pilots of new planning and management
processes, so that teething troubles and difficulties
can be resolved before moving to their widespread
introduction.
Institutional capacity-building typically seeks to
address issues raised at the local level. In so doing,
it frequently includes: the training of local professional and technical staff, as well as political
leaders; facilitating political–professional dialogue;
enhancing communications of the public sector
with the private sector; and improving government
dialogue with local communities and the nongovernment sector.
Cities in developing countries and countries
with economies in transitions have additional
capacity concerns – related to a backlog of longterm and structural institutional-capacity shortages.72 It should be noted that many deprived cities
in developed countries as well are in need of such
attention. Both contexts confront institutional
capacity-building challenges with regard to the
introduction of new approaches and tools, many of
which are increasingly based on information and
communications technologies. They are also confronted with challenges associated with the
introduction of a more holistic understanding of

having the potential to enhance the sustainability of urban
mobility systems.
Open source material is currently being used for nonmotorized vehicle mobility planning in many cities around the
world to expand infrastructure for walking and cycling and to
improve the conditions and connectivity of existing networks.
Furthermore, groups such as ‘seeclickfix.com’ crowd-source
tips on problems that need fixing in communities (including
mobility-related issues) and then direct feedback and
comments to local governments or agencies with the power
to fix these problems. Likewise, mobile applications such as
‘Moovit’ help riders make public-transport system-access
decisions based on crowd-sourced data about system
effectiveness, efficiency and temporary problems that might
cause delays or disruptions. Moreover, the World Bank, in
partnership with federal and local transportation agencies in
the Philippines, is piloting an open data system of public transport routes, schedules and fares.

only from developed to developing countries, but also
between developing countries.73 The challenge here
is in making judgements about the appropriateness
of the knowledge acquired/shared from an overseas
source to one’s own developmental circumstances
and aspirations.
However, it should be noted that when training
and capacity-building are provided as part of foreign
aid technical assistance, participants are frequently
not up to the required level to receive the course,
nor are they originally trained/educated to work in
the field of their employment. Furthermore, in many
instances, particularly in developing countries, it is
the wrong individuals that are being trained. The
ones invited for training courses are not the ones that
are actually doing the work; and in some cases
(particularly when funded by overseas agencies),
attendance on training courses is seen as a fringe
benefit and a means to access travel, extra allowances, etc. Moreover, course organizers are frequently not aware of the realities of the working
environments of the trainees and the training course
is often inadequately designed to meet the real needs
of the participants.74

POLICY RESPONSES AND
INNOVATIVE AND
‘SUCCESSFUL’ PRACTICES
This section presents a selection of innovative and
successful institutional and governance responses to
many of the challenges discussed in the previous
section. It should be stressed, however, that each
example cited does not necessarily incorporate all
facets of good practice, more likely only selected
dimensions.

Integrated urban land-use and mobility
planning
It is often argued that integration – in terms of landuse and transport planning and/or intermodal
integration – can only be achieved if the agencies
responsible are themselves integrated into one
agency. However, in the case of Singapore, the mechanism of cross-agency committees is used instead.
This has been successful as ‘the Singapore Government as a whole is relatively integrated, with less of
the departmental silos culture frequently seen in
other national and city governments’ in the region.75
The integration is also achieved by virtue of a large
percentage of its land being in government ownership. This permits the Singapore government to ‘use
land release strategically as a proactive means to guide
the implementation of [its] Concept and Land Use
Plans’ and for any other uses deemed to be in the
public benefit.76 These arrangements facilitate the
acquisition of land around metro stations before
construction. Singapore’s metro system has attracted
70 per cent of trips of all motorized modes within
25 years of its inauguration in 1987. This represents
a major achievement that has been largely attributed
to its effective institutional and governance arrangements.77
The integration of urban land-use and mobility
planning functions is also well reflected in other
countries. In the city of Seoul (Republic of Korea)

for example, the institutional structure for land use
and transport is directed by the mayor, with transportation responsibilities overseen by a vice mayor
(who heads the City Transportation Headquarters)
and land-use planning overseen by another vice
mayor (who heads the Urban Planning Bureau). The
mayor has an additional third arm of governance (the
Management and Planning Office) that oversees and
looks to manage and plan the integrative aspects of
both.78 In Japan, the national and regional institutional structure is especially conducive to the development of rail-orientated urban development.79 This
falls under the overall responsibility of the Ministry
of Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, which
includes five departments responsible for urban
transport, including the Railway Bureau.80
In Canada, the regional governance models
that facilitated the set-up of the TransLink in Vancouver;81 the transportation arms of the Capital
Region Board in Edmonton;82 and Metrolinx for the
Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area83 have been
applauded. All of these authorities ‘encourage regionwide coordination of land-use and transportation
planning and decision-making’.84 This includes
attempts to coordinate and integrate different modes
of transport.85
The city of Nantes in France is at the forefront
of sustainable mobility planning. This is largely due
to its long-term vision and commitment to an
integrated approach to urban planning and transport
over some 30 years (Box 9.6).86 Nantes’ approach to
provide an integrated network of multi-modal transport services has, to some extent, helped the city
manage the growth of private car use, simultaneously
retaining a high level of mobility for its citizens and
preserving their quality of life. The city is also a good
example of how an employer tax on public transport
provision (versement transport) has been widely
employed across France.87 The city has furthermore
been a pioneer in drawing up urban mobility plans.88
The latest of these (2010–2020) ‘sets out transport
policy for the next ten years and thematic action plans
are elaborated on topics such as public transport,

Box 9.6 Main causes for the sustainable mobility planning achievements of Nantes, France
The achievements are attributed to the city administration’s:
•
•

•

long-term city-wide vision and strategy;
competence across required areas to enable integration
of decisions and actions to implement (i.e. pricing and
availability of parking, integrated ticketing, infrastructure,
etc.);
ability to build consensus with surrounding
municipalities, gain political support and implement
integrated policies and plans, gaining the advantages of a
wide service area;

•

•

•

capability to make intelligent choices regarding: the
integration of modes and the use of a wider set of mobility
possibilities over and above the car, including bike-sharing,
car-pooling and walking options (such as pedestrian-only
zones);
sustained investment in quality infrastructure and
vehicles, thus providing attractive alternatives to private
car use;
provision of a high-quality public transport service at
an affordable price.

Privatization, decentralization and
centralization

Greater
awareness of the
rights of urban
residents can
positively
influence the
governance
structures of
urban
transportation

In Chile, and in some other South American countries, there is evidence that greater awareness of the
rights of urban residents can positively influence the
governance structures of urban transportation.
Citizen participation has played a role (to varying
degrees) in a number of major urban public transport developments in the region, including the TransMilenio (Box 7.7 and Box 9.12) and Transantiago
projects. The characteristics of the innovative institutional framework established for the latter are
outlined in Box 9.7. Notwithstanding the innovative
ideas behind this initiative, however, it has been
argued that the resultant institutional architecture
has become weak and predominantly reactive rather
than proactive, with decisions taken mainly by central
government. This has partly been explained by the
fact that there is no mayor with jurisdiction over all
districts of the city and that Transantiago staff are
not public officials, and mainly work on short-term
contracts with no clear individual responsibilities.90
The institutional and governance framework for
urban transport in Barcelona, Spain, is innovative in
that it allows a mix of public and private public transport operators to operate in the metropolitan area.
Apart from cities in Scandinavia, Barcelona is one of
the few cities in Europe where public and private
operators coexist within the same jurisdiction.
Such ‘mixed systems’ are believed to be capable of
increasing competition in the local market, providing
better information on costs, and ensuring that govern-

ments can guarantee a fail-safe service or reverse its
privatization decision if contracts fail. Under these
arrangements, Barcelona has made it possible to outsource bus services in certain municipalities, even
though the transportation authorities in the centre
of Barcelona have chosen to retain delivery of their
services. The main shortcoming of this model, however, is that the public transport provider (Transports
Metropolitans de Barcelona) retains a great deal of
autonomy from the regulator (Metropolitan Entity of
Transport), which makes it difficult to regulate the
former.91
Barcelona is also providing a good example of
how to enhance public participation, with its
‘mobility pact’ between the main stakeholders in the
transport sector (Box 9.8). This initiative has since
been copied in a number of other cities. Barcelona’s
mobility pact encourages participation by all actors in
the field of urban mobility in Barcelona, and related
activities are canalized in both formal and informal
ways. Several newspapers do for example publish daily
columns on mobility-related problems in the section
on ‘letters from our readers’, often with a photo, with
an opportunity for the responsible institution(s) to
respond.
The city of Amman, Jordan, provides an example
of a successful decentralized model of institutional
development and governance for the urban transport
sector, due to its multi-stakeholder structure.92
The Greater Amman Municipality is responsible
for policies and transportation system stewardship.
At the national level, the Ministry of Transport is
responsible for all intermediate and long-term plans
and studies, while the Public Transport Regulatory
Commission is responsible for public transportation.
This Commission is affiliated with the Ministry of

Box 9.7 Institutional framework for urban mobility in Santiago de Chile
This institutional framework for Santiago de Chile has the
following characteristics:
•

•

•

•

Profound political, economic and regulatory changes
(particularly in terms of liberalization and privatization)
in national governance that have taken place since the
1970s have greatly limited the role of government in urban
services provision.
A wide-ranging approach to the improvement of public
transportation has included new regulations for the bus
system with respect to, among other things, its levels of
service.
An extensive construction programme of urban and
suburban highways has been delivered via public–private
partnerships.
The city-wide Transantiago programme introduced a bus
rapid transport system that has become a centrepiece of
integrating the city’s overall public transport system.

•

•

Although there has been strong technical and institutional
capacity-building within the involved organizations, the
accumulated experience has unfortunately not resulted in
entirely successful implementation. This is primarily
attributed to limitations within the institutions involved
and issues of governance relating to, among other
things, the integration of land-use and urban transport
developments.
There is an almost total compartmentalization between
organizations in the city, leading to problems of
coordination. This has limited the institutional capacity
for integrated management in urban transport and land
use. It has also encouraged a tendency toward ‘reactive
management’ providing a context where decisions are
predominantly taken by a national authority.

Box 9.8 Social participation in decision-making: The ‘mobility pact’ in Barcelona, Spain
In 1998, the City of Barcelona defined a ‘mobility pact’ among
its 62 mobility-related stakeholders (i.e. users, operators,
manufacturers, providers, etc.). What started as mediaoriented performance and a ‘politically correct’ initiative has
turned out to be a great tool to reach agreements and
consensus about priorities for how to use the city’s limited
street space. The initiative involves thematic meetings, two
annual general meetings (with the presence of the mayor) and
follow-up of key performance indicators.
The ‘ten commandments’ of the mobility pact are:
1. High-quality, integrated public transport.
2. Maintain traffic speeds and improve the speed of surface
public transport.
3. Increase the surface area and quality for pedestrian use.

4. Increase the number of parking spaces and improve their
quality.
5. Improve citizens’ information and road signals and signs.
6. Legal regulations to be suited to the mobility of the city of
Barcelona.
7. Improve road safety and respect among users of various
transport modes.
8. Less polluting fuels, and reduce air and noise pollution
caused by traffic.
9. Promote the use of bicycles.
10. Efficient and orderly distribution of goods and products
throughout the city.

Box 9.9 Institutional developments for urban mobility in Hanoi, Viet Nam
The positive aspects of institutional development and
governance in Hanoi include:

However, a number of issues still remain to be addressed,
including:

•

•
•

•

•

•

The creation of a single local government area by the
extension of the administrative boundary to create a
‘Greater Hanoi’, which includes all areas likely to undergo
urbanization up to 2050.
The establishment of a Department of Transport by
bringing together most functions of urban transport within
Greater Hanoi in a single agency.
The introduction of strategic planning, thus reflecting
the decision of the central government to decentralize
responsibility for the preparation of construction master
plans for Hanoi.
The intention to establish a public transport authority
to be responsible for all aspects of public transport in
Hanoi, and to undertake studies to clarify the roles and
responsibilities of this authority.

Transport but has its own financial and administrative
independence.93
In contrast, a centralized model of institutional
development and governance for urban transport is
showing promise in Viet Nam. A relatively simple line
of authority between national and local government
has helped the establishment of strong city-wide
transport authorities of the kind recently proposed
for Hanoi (Box 9.9). The city offers good illustrations
of progress toward good practice (albeit slowly) in
institutional development and governance in urban
transport policy-making, land-use/transport strategic
planning and in public transport planning and
management.

Addressing urban boundary
complications
As noted earlier in this chapter, Auckland, New
Zealand, has recently seen the implementation of a
far-reaching reorganization of its governing structure.
As a result, a new council-controlled organization,
Auckland Transport, was established in November
2010, working under the new amalgamated Auckland
Council. The new organization combines the expertise and functions of eight former local and regional
councils and a regional transport authority (ARTA).
All transport functions and operations in Auckland
are now the responsibility of one organization.94
The establishment of Auckland Transport assumes
that ‘the Long-Term Council Community Plan and
District Plan will continue to guide Auckland Council

decision-making, pending decisions on a spatial plan
and infrastructure investment plan.’ These new
arrangements anticipate that ‘local boards will have
an advisory role in identifying local service needs and
a budget for planning and ‘place-shaping’.95
The decision that the local authority transport
network for Auckland is best managed as a single
network by Auckland Transport was premised on the
belief that it will provide a level of focus that could
not be provided by the full Auckland Council with
its multiplicity of responsibilities. The governance
framework allocates the main transport roles to
Auckland Transport with Auckland Council being
responsible for its long-term council community
plan. This establishes council transport funding for
the Auckland Transport, while the Auckland regional
land transport strategy sets out the transport
outcomes that the region wishes to achieve over a
30-year period. Under these arrangements, Auckland
Transport is responsible for planning and delivering
local ‘roads and footpaths . . . parking and train, bus
and ferry services’,96 including the preparation of the
Auckland regional land transport programme, which
sets out the transport projects anticipated over the
next three years.
Continued urban growth in Stockholm, Sweden,
has provided the impetus for the formation of a single
regional transport body, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik
in 1967. This agency assumed the public transport
responsibilities that had been previously distributed
among individual municipalities. The integration of
services and tariffs was a primary goal of this institution – with bus, metro, regional rail, and ferry services
all procured for the city by Storstockholms Lokaltrafik.
Owned by the Stockholm City Council, Storstockholms Lokaltrafik is the parent company for four
operating companies, two dormant subsidiaries and
six associated companies. The organization’s activities
include providing:97
• an operational ‘overview’ of the region’s public
transport system and services;

• an overall service quality of the region’s public
transport system and simultaneously being
responsible for the supervision of maintenance;
• initiatives for the development of the system;
• services for the purchases and procurements of
the region’s public transport system.

Mobility policy, plan-making and
management
The State of Victoria, Australia, offers a good example
of promoting institutional system integration and sustainability for urban mobility through its recent
legislative reforms spawned by the State of Victoria
Transport Integration Act of 2010.98 Whereas Victoria’s urban transport governance was in the past
dispersed among different parties with differing
objectives and interests, preventing the recognition
of the interconnected nature of transport and land
use, the Act provided a common state policy framework. This framework seeks to:
• unify all elements of the transport portfolio to
ensure that transport agencies work together
towards an integrated and sustainable transport
system;
• recognize that the transport system needs to be
sustainable in both economic, social and environmental terms;
• enable the transport system to be conceived and
planned as a single system rather than as separate
or competing transport modes;
• provide a universal framework for integrated and
sustainable transport policy and operations;
• integrate land-use and transport planning and
decision-making by extending the coverage of the
Act to land-use agencies whose decisions are
likely to have a significant impact on the transport system;
• align the charters of transport agencies with the
overarching policy framework to increase the
modal share of public transport.

Box 9.10 Climate change activity at the state level, US
State climate action plans: As of April 2010, 33 US states
had developed state climate action plans, with several others
in the process of doing so. Some have been formally adopted
by the respective governor or state legislature; others were
prepared as reports without any official action being taken.
Many state departments of transport have developed
strategies or policies for implementing the transportation
elements of these plans. Yet others are taking a range of
additional actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Local government climate activities: Nearly 800 mayors
have signed the US Conference of Mayors Climate Protection

Agreement, agreeing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at
least 7 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.
Climate planning by metropolitan planning organizations:
Many metropolitan planning organizations, especially larger
ones, are analysing greenhouse gas emissions from
transportation in their metropolitan areas, developing
transportation greenhouse gas inventories and baseline
protections, as well as identifying possible strategies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from transport.

Mainstreaming environmental concerns
Although the Federal Government of US has not
enacted climate change legislation, there is a great
deal of climate change activity at the level of the
states. These reveal significant advances being made
that perhaps defy the international impression of the
US federal government’s negative attitudes to the
climate change agenda (Box 9.10).
In the UK, London ‘considers itself an exemplar in moving towards a low carbon economy’. It
views sustainability ‘primarily as an environmental
quality with reductions in [carbon dioxide] and local
pollutants being the major objectives’.99 In order to
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, London has
focused on ‘investment in higher density developments and the use of transport development areas
at key interchanges that are public transport
accessible. It is now considering alternative fuels and
has taken the lead in investing in an electric vehicle
infrastructure, in cycle hire schemes and in cycle
highways’.100 Major infrastructure investment is seen
as a significant part of the Mayor’s 2010 Transport
Strategy, in order to enhance the capacity and connectivity of the capital’s public transport system
following a history of underinvestment.101

Mainstreaming mobility needs of the
socially and economically disadvantaged
The EU’s plans to introduce a framework for the
preparation of urban mobility plans are among the
most innovative measures to promote institutional
development and governance within the urban transport sector. This represents a major pan-European
effort at promoting walking, cycling and public transport in urban areas. The European Commission
recommends:102
• the establishment of procedures and financialsupport mechanisms at the European level for
preparing urban mobility audits and urban mobility
plans;
• the examination of the possibility of a mandatory
approach to such plans for cities of a certain size;
• the linking of EU regional development and
cohesion funds to cities and regions that have
submitted a current, and independently validated
‘urban mobility performance and sustainability
audit’ certificate;
• the examination of the possibility of a European
support framework for a progressive implementation of urban mobility plans.
South Africa’s efforts to promote urban mobility
plans since 1999 do in some respects reflect these
developments in Europe.103 The ‘Moving South
Africa’ Project attempted to develop a strategic
framework for transport in the country. It called for
transparent decision-making, funding and pricing for

the transport sector and looked to the reorientation
of transport towards customer needs. The government’s role was to provide a clear vision, the establishment of strong institutions, the setting of clear
rules for reinforcing the vision, the development of
human capacity, and the measuring and monitoring
of performance. The project considered customers
of the South African (urban) ‘transport system to
be disempowered and weakly organized’. It also
considers ‘the upgrading of customer power [as] a
precondition for improvement to the transport
system’.104
Another innovative international measure that
has the potential to impact urban transport institutional development and governance is initiatives to
increase the engagement of youth. With this in mind,
the Youth for Public Transport Group was set up as
part of UITP’s Youth Project.105 ‘The group was formed
to recognize innovative public transport projects that
include youth and to start a dialogue between youth
groups and government through more formal mechanisms so that young voices can be heard’.106 Yet,
another initiative in this area is the Tanzanian initiative
to introduce a regulatory framework and a Consumer
Consultative Council to represent the interests of all
public transport users (including the disabled).107
Hong Kong, China, is already undertaking a systematic monitoring and enforcement, against very clear
requirements and goals with respect to the mobility
rights of the disabled.108

Addressing freight movement needs
The city of Paris has employed an explicit transport
policy for freight since the early 2000s, and has
promoted a Charter for freight movement (Box
9.11). Notwithstanding some disappointments, ‘Paris
can be considered one of the most active European
cities in the field of urban freight management’.109
Some ‘two-thirds of shipments coming in and going
out of the metropolitan area of Ile-de-France go
through a regional terminal in order to be transhipped
and reorganised’,110 demonstrating the strategic role
of logistics terminals in large metropolitan areas.
The ‘National Programme for Freight in Cities’
established by the French Ministry of Transport
in 1993 carried out surveys of freight movement in
France and established a database for urban freight
demand in the entire country. Based on this information it built a simulation model of future movements. A second phase of the surveys started in
2010. The surveys revealed the characteristics of
‘logistics sprawl’ and that freight transport generates
a large proportion of local transport-based pollution in Ile-de-France. As a result, in 2011 the city of
Paris was designated as one of six ‘zones for priority’
to address air pollution produced by commercial
vehicles, targeting especially the restriction of access
by old commercial vehicles.111

Box 9.11 The Freight Charter, Paris, France
Since 2001, urban goods transport, long neglected in Paris’
mobility policies, has been brought to the municipal agenda as
part of a new approach in transport planning, with the main
aim of alleviating the negative environmental impacts of freight
movement.
In 2002 a consultation brought together the deputy
mayor with the various freight transport stakeholders – as well
as rail operators, energy providers and other public agencies –
with a view to informing each other of their respective
challenges and priorities. In 2006, as a result of these
consultations, a Freight Charter was signed by all parties.
While not a legally binding document, it identified
commitments made. The most salient of the conclusions of
this charter were that it:

•

•
•
•

•

declared that consultation helped defuse conflicts before
they break out, between parties that (previously) usually
never met;
introduced enforcement of truck access and delivery
regulations;
highlighted the land scarcity for logistic activities, especially
in the inner suburbs;
suggested that experimenting with new forms of city
logistics organizations is an effective way of spreading new
ideas:
concluded that the relevant jurisdiction for policies is
regional rather than local given that freight flows traverse
all local boundaries.

Box 9.12 Land-use and transport planning, Bogotá, Colombia
Colombia carried out an ambitious decentralization process
in the mid-1980s, whereby mayors and governors previously
chosen by the president of the republic have since been
elected by universal suffrage and have become the authority in
charge of the principal economic, social and environmental
developments of their territory. These developments were
facilitated by legislation introduced in the early 1990s that, in
the case of Bogotá, provided for a new organization to be set
up (the Distrito Capital) giving more autonomy to the
executive power (the mayor) and contributing to a better
fiscal organization. The ‘Territory Development Law’,
introduced in 1991, sought to harmonize former legislation,
instructing every municipality and district in Colombia to
autonomously develop long-term plans.

Public transport planning and service
delivery
The TransMilenio system provides mass public transport services – in the form of a BRT system – for the
city of Bogotá, Colombia. It not only provides strategies to improve public transport but also seeks to
recuperate public space, discourage the use of cars
and encourage cycling (Box 7.7). Devolving power
from national to newly created city governments
with directly elected city mayors was an important
precondition for TransMilenio (Box 9.12). A 1998
law created a public entity with a mandate to manage,
plan and control passenger urban transport services
in the metropolitan area of Bogotá.112 By this law,
the state builds and maintains the infrastructure,
while private companies acquire and operate the
fleets of buses and other public transport vehicles.
TransMilenio itself has no contracts with these
operating companies. Instead, the municipal authority
places the contracts and TransMilenio provides the

In Bogotá, the mayor of the Distrito Capital was given
wide responsibilities in policy and planning, and in the
development of projects in land use, transportation, health,
environment, education, public services as well as other
relevant domains, on the understanding they were consistent
with legal frameworks defined at a national level.
Enrique Peñalosa (who was mayor 1998–2001) oversaw
the development of the TransMilenio BRT system, which
commenced operations in 2000 (Box 7.7). Following its
success, mobility plans were prepared for Bogotá and its
region in 2006. These built on many of the ideas and visions of
the TransMilenio, and ensured complementarity and
consistency with the overall land-use plan.

management service for infrastructure (including
cycle paths) and transport operations. The formal
institutional link between TransMilenio and Bogotá’s
municipal authorities means that the influence of
citizens (as users of transport) is strong. The result
is that there is ‘political leadership and authority
to make the appropriate decisions necessary to
implement the transport system’.113
Numerous institutional arrangements have also
recently been set up in India to deliver and operate
BRT systems, including in Ahmedabad where
Ahmedabad Janmarg Ltd. was constituted to run/
operate the system. While the Ahmedabad Municipal
Corporation remains the chief executing authority
of the system, the ‘use of local expertise in lieu of
international consultants not only ensured responsiveness to local conditions and technology transfer,
but was also effective in keeping cost low’.114 With

financial and other incentives at the national level,
this strong political commitment across several levels
of government was instrumental to the implementation of the project.
As in the case of the Janmarg BRT, the Delhi
metro was financed from multi-tiered funds and
planned as an integral part of a larger multi-modal
transport system. It similarly enjoyed widespread
political support in central government, even though
the larger scale of the Delhi project presented greater
challenges. What is most significant about the
institutional arrangements for this project is that it
is being promoted as a viable public transport model
for other South Asian cities.115
The rail-oriented urban development strategy
employed throughout Japan is also interesting. This
is supported by national and city governments,
promoted by influential private rail companies and
reinforced by the country’s government. The rail
companies are part of large Japanese commercial and
industrial consortia that also have real estate and
retailing interests, as well as construction and banking
interests. These seek to take advantage of land developments around stations so as to ensure maximum
use of their rail networks. They do this by acquiring
large areas of land along proposed rail extensions prior
to any development. Japan’s rail-orientated development strategy has especially benefited from the
country’s land readjustment programme. Here irregular patterns of agricultural land holdings were in the
past rearranged into regular building plots and
equipped with basic urban infrastructure, with a small
percentage of each landowner’s holding providing
land for roads and parks to cover the costs of the
project.116
Throughout the US, the perception of urban
public transport is largely poor. The improvement of
the image and performance of this mode of travel
thus has major governance dimensions. In response
to this, new investments have been made in light rail
and BRT, especially in some of the smaller but rapidly

growing cities, such Portland, Oregon and Salt Lake
City, Utah. In the case of Portland (Box 9.13), governance of land use and transport policy have been
employed as twin pillars for the creation of additional
capacity and as a stimulus for growth.

Multi-modal integration
The city of Stockholm and its surrounding region are
regarded as having one of Europe’s best public transport systems. Together they are renowned for their
progressive approaches to integrated urban land use
and transport planning, and multi-modal integration,
with its public transport services being of special
interest to those concerned about sustainable urban
mobility.117 The current development plan for the
Stockholm region foresees a polycentric structure of
seven new ‘cores’ for urban growth, with public transport recognized as key to meeting the increased
mobility demands spawned by these new growth
centres (Figure 5.16).118 It is envisaged that these
cores will eventually function as independent multimodal urban transport hubs that will enhance the
overall efficiency of the utilization of transportation
and land use within the region.
To enhance multi-modal integration of passenger services, in August 2012 Storstockholms
Lokaltrafik appointed Deutsche Bahn Arriva to provide a new regional transport service that involves
planning and operating an integrated and complex
system of bus and rail. This is the largest multimodal transport contract of its kind in Sweden, and
after implementation of the second phase of the contract119 it is estimated that these services will carry
some 94 million passengers per year.120
There are also some encouraging developments in some African cities where metropolitan
transport authorities have recently been established
to integrate the governance of disparate modes.
An example is the establishment (in 2002) of the
Metropolitan Area Transport Authority in Lagos

Box 9.13 Institutional and governance framework in support of light rail in
Portland, Oregon, US
Strategy to improve public transport: As part of a broader
strategy for Portland, a light rail system – comprised of 38
closely spaced stations – has increased walking trips and
reduced the demand for parking.
Revenue earning system to finance the project: To help
finance the project, city parking charges were increased, and
the city issued bonds backed by future parking revenues
predicted to raise US$28.5 million. Property owners along the
line also agreed to form a ‘local improvement district’ that
looked to generate a further US$10 million, while a tax
increment and mix of other sources generated another
US$11 million.

191

Accompanying urban revitalization strategy: The Portland
Development Council was set up to stimulate the private
market by investing – prior to the project – in new housing,
commercial opportunities and open space in locations near the
light rail stations. This permitted the city to leverage public
improvements necessary to support a more balanced, higher
density development that in turn generated a significant stream
of tax revenue.

The LAMATA project, funded by US$100 million of World
Bank credit in 2002, involves re-regulation of the informal
sector, and using road rehabilitation as a lever and an
instrument to reduce poverty through employment on road
works.
Public transport service franchises have been introduced
on roads improved by the project while other (non-franchise)
operators are prohibited from using these roads.
On the institutional side, the project has helped to
create a regulatory authority (LAMATA), with a financial

(Nigeria) (Box 9.14), and (in 1997) the Executive
Council of Urban Transport in Dakar (Senegal) (Box
9.1).121 In Abidjan (Côte d’Ivoire), in 2002, a state
board (AGETU) was established for the management
and coordination of public transport, with the
management of the minibuses and taxi licences
among its principal tasks. This organization has,
unfortunately, from the outset been hampered by its
conflict with the municipalities of Abidjan who have
been reluctant to transfer the funds obtained from
the fees and taxes levied on shared taxis.122
Other cities have also made – or are in the process of proposing – important changes to their public
transport and mobility systems. The municipality of
Montevideo, Uruguay, has since 2005 sought to
transform its public transport, freight and commercial
developments to offer greater connectivity to ports,
airports and rail termini, simultaneously emphasizing
the importance of non-motorized movement.123
Similarly, the city authority of Rosario, Argentina, has
after a ten year experience in strategic planning
decided to strategically invest in pedestrian access
to public transport services and cycle routes. It has
also imposed tight parking controls. This demonstrates how small cities can function in the broader
territorial context.124

Sustainable funding
Like Singapore, Hong Kong (China) is widely
considered to have a successfully organized and
sustained funding of its urban transport system. The
ingredients of Hong Kong’s success can be attributed
to its progressive transport policies maintained
over the last 30 years; its ‘effective regulatory and
co-ordination mechanisms that subjugated all
agencies and transport operators to basic policy
objectives’, and financial discipline maintained by
all undertakings, both privately owned or run on
commercial lines.125 As noted in Chapter 8, Hong
Kong’s metro projects have always been selffinancing, due to its successful policy of value capture,

budget transfers from the Lagos state government, and a
share of road user charges.
No provision has been made to seek street space
exclusivity for public transport vehicles, reflecting a sober
assessment of what was ‘politically feasible’.
The project design is unusual in that investments in one
mode (road infrastructure) are used to leverage regulatory
changes for another mode (public transport services). This was
possible because the client government (Lagos state) has
jurisdiction over both modal systems.
Source: Mitric, 2008, p50.

made possible thorough a full integration of land-use
and transportation planning. The income generated
by the MTRC from its highly profitable rail-orientated
property development, together with its fare-box
revenues from the very high patronage levels its
services enjoy, makes MTRC one of the few profitable railway companies in the world.126
Mainland China has retained state ownership of
land, which has enabled its urban public authorities
– as in the case of Hong Kong and Singapore – to
capture far more of the land-value increases associated with transportation and other urban infrastructure investments than in most cities elsewhere. The
adoption of land leases in China (generally of 70
years) for urban transport-related mixed-use developments offers huge scope and potential for similar
financial rewards for the public sector. However, in
some cases such rewards are not materializing at the
scale expected. It has been suggested that this is due
to the excessively close links that have developed
between some city mayors and leading entrepreneurs,
involving non-transparent transactions and conflicts
of interests.127
The mayoral supervision responsibilities provide the mayor in Greater London (UK) with the
mandate and power to rapidly design and implement
congestion charging, which has both improved the
mobility into and through central London, and proved
popular at the same time.128 Furthermore, in March
2012, the mayor was given the power129 to raise
money for infrastructure projects through the introduction of the community infrastructure levy. These
revenues will be charged on most developments in
London at differential rates depending on zones,
ranging from £20 to £50 per square metre.130 Despite
these initiatives, however, the investment demands
look set to remain challenging due to a backlog of
infrastructure investment over the last 50 years.
In the face of such infrastructure investment
challenges, some national governments (principally
in developed countries) have established national
agencies specifically assigned responsibilities for

the Infrastructure Australia Act of 2008. It advises governments, investors and infrastructure owners on a wide range of
issues that include:
•
•
•

Australia’s current and future infrastructure needs;
Mechanisms for financing infrastructure investments;
Policy, pricing and regulation and their impacts on
investment and on the efficiency of the delivery, operation

the planning, appraisal and funding of critical infrastructure, including major urban transport schemes.
In Australia, for example, ‘Infrastructure Australia’,
provides advice to the Treasury on budget priorities
and allocations in major infrastructure investments
(Box 9.15) and how best to engage with the private
sector in financing such projects.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
AND LESSONS FOR POLICY
The challenges of urban mobility systems can only
be addressed if they are seen as political challenges,
requiring political consultation, decision and implementation, as opposed to seeing them as purely
technical challenges requiring the ‘right’ technical
solutions. Thus, urban governance and related institutional and regulatory frameworks are at the heart
of developing sustainable urban mobility systems,
and, indeed, sustainable cities. The primary purposes
of such frameworks should be to remove obstacles
to the effective participation of all stakeholders in
the decision-making process; ensure that information
employed to support urban transport proposals is
comprehensive, accurate, impartial and transparent;
and facilitate effective implementation of political
decisions.
The development of effective urban governance
and institutional frameworks is a complex issue.
There are no universal solutions. However, this does
not imply that the identification of ‘good practice’ is
futile. Urban transport agencies and related organizations need to be aware of lessons of urban mobility
planning ‘successes’ (and ‘failures’) from elsewhere
(and other times). Furthermore, the concept of sustainable development is increasingly acknowledged
as a key determinant of funding by international
development agencies in their dealings with local
decision-makers. Thus, it is expected that the
‘success’ in attracting external funding to achieve
more sustainable outcomes in urban transport will,
over time, lead to a spreading of good practice.

Infrastructure Australia’s focus is on assisting Australian
governments to develop a strategic blueprint for unlocking
infrastructure bottlenecks and to modernize the country’s
economic infrastructure. Infrastructure Australia reports
regularly to the Council of Australian Governments through
the Federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport.
Infrastructure Australia has 12 members, appointed by the
Federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport.

The institutional architecture for urban transport
planning interventions and investments should
facilitate holistic thinking and integrated actions
consistent with strategies for sustainability. Thus, and
due to their high costs, ad hoc, short-term, politically
expedient decision-making should be avoided. In
practice, political champions have played a critical
part in creating integration in urban governance.
Strong political leadership does play an important
part in the planning and delivery of major transport
infrastructure projects in particular.131 It is important
that such leadership is transparent and accountable, to ensure that it doesn’t become personal and
transitional. This may not only enhance people’s
trust in the institutions and governance structures,
but also ensure that these do not collapse once their
champion leaves office.
The objectives, political will, processes and
effectiveness of public engagement undertaken by
urban transport organizations are context dependent.
Without effective participation, proper stakeholder
influence cannot be brought to bear. Measures need
to be introduced that ensure that the mobility needs
and ‘accessibility rights’ of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups are addressed. Participation and
consultation should also be extended to informal
sector transport operators (and their organizations),
in particular due to their essential role in providing
affordable mobility options for low-income groups in
most developing countries.
In urban areas where no single governance
authority exists, this has proved a major impediment
to integration in the field of urban transport. The
development of sustainable urban mobility systems
requires a matching of authority with territory.
‘Effective’ institutions for governing integrated
transport systems require empowerment that permits them to execute their responsibilities within
their designated area boundaries. Evidence suggests
that if institutions are matched to location – circumstances that encourage public transport systems,
political institutions, existing policy frameworks,
etc., to evolve in a mutually supportive manner – the
task of integration is largely a matter of operational

coordination. Where there has been a history of
intense inter-agency competitiveness, the task of
integration is far more problematic.
Experience indicates that there is a positive
relationship between effective integrated transport
systems and jurisdictions that have experience in
dealing with ‘regional’ types of transport. Many
of the cities with experience in dealing with issues
of regional governance have over time developed
improved multi-modal working relationships in the
transport sector. Likewise, the extent of centralization and the degree of effectiveness of urban
transportation institutions are very often positively
correlated to the detriment of sustainable mobility
planning. Thus – where ‘centralization’ represents
the extent to which each mode has its own organizational cultures, constituencies as well as powerful
interest groups that benefit from a modal focus –
organizations are frequently focusing on the interests
of the operator of a specific mode, rather than looking
to intermodal integration.

Effective institutional development and governance for urban mobility requires good land-use
planning, good public transport planning and good
demand management – designed wherever possible
to minimize the need to travel and to increase the
modal shift toward public and non-motorized transport. To facilitate this, urban transport and land-use
planning authorities require ongoing capacity-building designed to keep abreast of key issues at all
levels and for all sectors of the population. Despite
the increasing need for integrated land-use and
mobility planning, most cities and countries still
separate the functions of land-use and transport
planning at almost every level of government. However, the value of integrated policy-making, planning
and management is increasingly being acknowledged,
particularly (but not exclusively) in developed
countries.

(requiring strategic planning)
and the short/immediate term
(covering traffic management,
public transport (bus) planning
and designs, as well as truck
movement management)
(UNCHS, 1990). Furthermore,
transport developments involve

CHAPTER

10

TOWARD SUSTAINABLE
URBAN MOBILITY
Global trends, such as rapid urbanization and motorization, pose tremendous challenges to urban mobility
and accessibility. Yet, the changing context within
which these are occurring, and the experience it is
generating, present new opportunities for advancing innovative policies and programmes for sustainable development as a whole. The previous chapters
have discussed the scope and depth of numerous
contemporary challenges and best practices in urban
mobility and accessibility worldwide. This closing
chapter ties the analysis together and focuses on
practices, policies and strategies that can be implemented, not only by local authorities but also by
national governments. The crux of this chapter is an
elucidation of the concrete ramifications of key
messages espoused in the report pertaining to the
shift from focusing on improving the efficiency of
urban transportation to enhancing accessibility in the
city as a whole.
Before embarking on policy recommendations it
is appropriate, first, to revisit some of the dysfunctional trends that were highlighted in the preliminary chapters and that necessitate the paradigmatic
shift reiterated throughout this report. Indeed, the
most prominent trend emerging from Chapters 2 to
4 is that, generally, it is becoming more difficult to
access places, opportunities and services in many
cities of the world. Owing to urban sprawl, distances
between functional destinations have become longer;
widespread congestion has increased travel time;
and high capital, as well as operating, expenses have
led to increasing costs of accessibility. As a result, a
number of social groups are structurally discouraged
from accessing many parts of the cities where they
live, and a number of city residents are therefore
deprived of the full benefits offered by urbanization.
Furthermore, poor accessibility has reduced the
efficiency and functionality of many cities in the
world.
Another trend highlighted in this report is the
steady increase in the share of private motorized
transport, including the extremely high motorization

rates in developing countries. This also occurs in
regions where the dominant mode of mobility
remains non-motorized transportation, such as in the
case of Africa and Asia. Apart from the inherent
inequity associated with private motorized transport,
the negative externalities it generates are quite
substantial. It has been revealed that there is a
relative stagnation and even decline of public transport in cities of developing countries, even though
it constitutes a most effective means of enhancing
urban accessibility, as well as of promoting sustainable urban development.
The report also reveals that the configuration of
cities in terms of form, structure and function has
been highly influenced by the dominance of private
transport infrastructure, facilities and services. The
embedded imperative of private motorization as the
dominant mobility mode has dictated the layout
and design of streets and neighbourhoods; dispersion
of densities; and location of functions. Perpetuation
of this model in much of the past century has generated a self-replicating crisis of urban accessibility:
more vehicles, necessitating more infrastructure,
compelling a need for more vehicles, fostering more
spatial expansion, calling for additional infrastructure and vehicles, with the vicious circle continuing
ad infinitum. At the same time, in most cities, the
neglect of urban freight distribution and management
of freight transport, both in land-use and transport
planning tends to make goods transportation a major
impediment to sustainable urban mobility and to
accessing the city.
Underlying all the above challenges has been a
marked distortion in the institutional structures,
management systems, as well as legal and regulatory
frameworks. Fragmentation among institutions dealing with different aspects of mobility and accessibility
is rife. The management principles and norms guiding planning, design and even delivery tend to compound the problems instead of ameliorating them.
Moreover, the regulatory instruments are not fully
compatible with the demands of sustainability.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

Value generation
through
accessibility
has not been
optimally utilized
in many cities of
. . . developed and
developing
countries

The report has highlighted that the world market
for railway infrastructure and equipment has been
growing at 3.2 per cent a year, and is set to grow at
around 2.7 per cent annually.1 However, the global
distribution of metro systems shows a concentration
of metros in Europe, Eastern Asia and the eastern
part of the US. It is further noted that in mega-cities
of developing countries where the mobility demand
on major corridors is appropriately high, metros
remain the only economically and environmentally
viable public transport system. For cities which do
not have the passenger threshold for metros and the
economic capacity to invest in them, bus rapid transit
(BRT) has become a viable option, at least in the short
and medium term.
On the whole, the report acknowledges the
critical importance of accessibility for enhancing
the economies of agglomeration and urbanization. It
analyses how the urban function is improved and
potential of value enhancement realized through
accessibility. However, the report shows that the
process of value generation through accessibility has
not been optimally utilized in many cities of both the
developed and developing countries. In the latter
case this has been largely due to the separation and
sectoralization of land use and transportation, as well
as the inadequate integration among transport modes.
In the case of some cities in developed countries,
delays and procrastinations in investments and
expansion have led to lost opportunities.
The report underlines that urban mobility and
accessibility are key for promoting sustainable
urban development. They are also directly connected
to urban stock and flows – in terms of spatial development and consolidation of the built form. They
are therefore associated with value creation, improvement of welfare and enhancement of citizenship.
Furthermore, urban mobility systems have the
potential to positively impact on material and energy
flows. However, these systems have not adequately
contributed to the desired outcomes owing to their
prevailing shortcomings. This report therefore emphasizes that there is an urgent need to reframe urban
mobility policies and practices in order to address
these shortcomings.

POLICIES AND PRACTICES
FOR REFRAMING URBAN
MOBILITY
The overall challenges as well as positive experiences and practices discussed in this report form the
basis for key lessons to be drawn for adaptation
and replication. They underline the multi-dimensional
nature of sustainable urban mobility in terms of both
policy and operational implications. Coherence in
strategic interventions and linkages among processes

are some of the essential principles that emerge from
the preceding chapters. It is reckoned that the
ultimate enhancement of accessibility is neither a
function of hardware – be it highways, rail or vehicles
– nor an outcome of ad hoc spatial delocalization and
decongestion.
This report advocates for a paradigm shift in
addressing urban mobility. The signposts of how to
make the shift are written throughout the report.
The discussion below summarizes some of the key
attributes for a recalibration of how cities are
designed and planned and how urban transport
services are organized and delivered in the quest for
more sustainable mobility.

Holistic and systemic thinking and action
Urban mobility is finely woven into the spatial,
social, economic, political and environmental fabric
of cities. In charting a path for sustainable urban
mobility, it is essential to apply an ecological and
systems framework that recognizes this. Many of the
contemporary challenges facing cities – for example
auto-dependent sprawl, persistent poverty, lack of
accountability and participatory decision-making – are
structural in nature, rooted in current regulatory,
institutional and economic systems and approaches.
Only by recognizing the systemic nature of problems
(mispricing leads to overconsumption of roads in
peak periods; sprawling settlement patterns render
public transport systems ineffectual; urban design for
machines rather than people creates cities for cars
rather than people) can significant headway be made
in charting a sustainable mobility future.

Transport as a means, not an end
It is essential that travel is recognized as a ‘derived
demand’ – i.e. derived from the need for people to
socially and economically ‘interact’. The end or objective of most travel is to meet a friend, earn income,
attend school or purchase a good, not movement
per se. Cars, trains, buses and bikes are simply the
means to achieve these ends. Making this distinction
shifts the focus to ‘people’ and ‘places’ and away from
‘movement’. This realization envisages cities, neighbourhoods, regions and mobility systems as tools
that promote desired societal outcomes – such as
liveability and affordable access – with transport
playing a supportive role. Operationally, this can
take the form of compact, mixed-use communities
that dramatically shorten trip distances and improve
pedestrian and bicycling infrastructure. Compact
cities are less reliant on private cars and minimize
distances travelled, thereby conserving energy, land
and environmental resources. They are also more
resilient, enabling them to better adapt to the vagaries
and uncertainties of climate change and other global
unknowns.

Accessibility as a priority rather than
transport

Enhancing the linkage between land use
and transport

Related to this notion of travel as a derived demand
and transportation as a means to an end is the core
principle of accessibility. Accessible cities not only
put places (e.g. homes and workplaces, or ‘trip
origins and destinations’) closer to each other, but
also provide safe and efficient pedestrian and cycling
corridors and affordable, high-quality public transport
options. That is, they are accessible to all. Recasting
the sector’s primary objective as one of enhancing
accessibility invariably leads to a different set of
policies and strategies, like transit-oriented development and the provision of highly interconnected
bikeway networks. These strategies not only conserve
land, energy and financial resources, but also help
the poor and those without private motorized vehicles
to access goods and services within the city. In short,
accessible cities are inclusive, resourceful and propoor.

While the pitfalls of overreliance on technological
and supply-side solutions to urban mobility are
acknowledged, the important role of transport cannot
be discounted. The missing ingredient causing the
observed pitfall has been the disconnect between the
essence of land use and the logic of transport. This
connection needs to be re-established for sustainable
urban mobility to be achieved; and it can only be
effectively initiated at the highest level – through
national urban policy initiatives.
Indeed, the national urban policy is given
prominence for this connection mainly because of
its role as a statutory instrument that not only
articulates a vision for urban development, but also
defines the relationship among sectors, agencies and
stakeholders. When properly articulated, national
urban policy offers the most authoritative instrument
for elevating the linkage between land-use and transport planning beyond the bureaucratic and political compromises often reached. As elaborated in
Chapter 5, the integration is not simply a technical
exercise at the local level. It represents a totality of
how cities are at a given time, while also identifying
the parameters of their future growth. Substantive
guidelines are therefore required to ensure effective
harnessing of the dynamic synergy of a given national
urban system. These guidelines should then subsequently be translated at the sub-national level – from
region, through metropolitan area, to the municipality
and ultimately at the neighbourhood and street level.
An integrated approach to land use and transport harmonizes planning of the two processes out
of the bounded confines of specific ministry and
departmental mandates, turning them into a coordinated and integrated exercise at policy and operational levels. It shifts the focus of planning from
placement of structures and designation of land use
to that of enabling the realization of people’s needs
and everyday functions in the most efficient and sustainable manner. Within this approach, the key
challenge is therefore not merely to overcome the
separate handling of transport and land-use planning; or even to ensure a juxtaposition of the two.
Rather, it is to foster an organic integration of the
entire continuum of a multi-modal mobility within a
holistic and sustainable land-use system where
dynamic synergies are harnessed; interconnections
are promoted; and functionality optimized. In the
whole process, the aspect of design serves as a main
bridge linking the key dimensions and attributes for
ensuring sustainability and accessibility.
In many cities of the world, particularly those
in developing countries, there is a persisting challenge
of identifying whose responsibility it is to take the
integration of land use and transport (and ideas such
as those mentioned above) from theory to a practical

POLICY AND OPERATIONAL
ENTRY POINTS
From the above normative framework, the following section presents six policy and operational areas
that can be developed to suit different settings and
through which accessibility-based sustainable mobility
can be achieved. These are: enhancing the linkage
between land use and transport; revitalizing urban
planning and transport engineering designs;
realigning transport infrastructure investment and
development; integrating urban transport facilities
and service operations; streamlining urban institutions and governance framework; and readjusting legal and regulatory instruments. Each of these
is discussed in some more detail in the sections
below.
The generic designation of the above categories
reflects everyday policy processes. These policy areas
have been adopted for this conclusion for two
reasons. First, to underscore the fact that the shift
being advocated in this report is mainly viable when
undertaken within existing institutional structures
and processes. Second, to highlight that since these
are generic proposals, they would have to be slightly
adapted to each city’s unique circumstances prior to
actual implementation. Furthermore, the categories
are also deemed appropriate because they allow for
encompassing a variety of settings and levels of
development. However, the overall logic of the six
categories lies in their strategic linkage and their
cumulative potential for triggering policy and
operational change.

level. This is particularly the case in view of existing
constraints of land geography, activity distribution and
evolution, economic and financial constraints, and
institutional and regulatory limitations.
The comprehensive integration of land-use and
transport needs to be thematically cross-cutting
and multi-sectoral. This reflects the co-dependence
of urban systems – for example urban growth induced
by a world-class high-capacity public transport
investment increases the demand for electric power
and water capacity, new housing construction and
business centres. Multi-sectoral planning also exploits
opportunities for economizing on the costs of urban
services and infrastructure outlays, such as using
rights of way reserved for a new fixed-guideway
public transport line to also lay broadband cable,
storm-runoff channels and utility lines.

Revitalizing urban planning and transport
engineering designs
The strong connection between transport ‘supply and
demand’ and urban form is a key theme highlighted
throughout this report. These influence and reinforce
each other both in positive and negative ways. The
various cases highlighted in the report demonstrate
that the convenience of mobility and the degree of
accessibility in cities are determined by the processes
emanating from the relationship between the patterns of transport and urban form in the given setting.
From the analysis of Chapter 5 on urban form, and
the elaboration of sustainability pillars in the subsequent chapters, an important organizing principle can
be deduced. Namely, the linkage between urban form
and transport is realized through the optimization of
density, enhanced proximity and co-location, as well
as improvements in the functionality and inclusiveness of places and facilities.
Sustainable densities are essential for sustainable
mobility; not only because of its minimum energy
consumption and smaller environmental footprint,
but also because it contributes to increasing proximity
and co-location. Density can be optimized through
the use of regulatory instruments, such as zoning
laws and the application of locational incentives, such
as infrastructural investments, as well as through
design interventions. Compact configurations complemented with transport-oriented development
minimize private motorization while making it viable
for cities to invest in different modes of public
transportation. Different density configurations and
gradients are discussed in the report demonstrating
the range of options in promoting compactness for
sustainable mobility. However, a caution is also
registered that while density is necessary, it is not a
sufficient condition especially for moderating private
car use and for arresting urban sprawl.
The notion of sustainable density is applied in
the report in the strict sense of making a distinction

with the condition of overcrowding or with slumlike concentration of populations. The planned
optimization of density advocated in this report
enables the attainment of economies of scale,
making it viable to provide a range of facilities at the
least cost. The compactness engendered allows for
more public space while also exerting a minimum
impact on the environment. Coupled with appropriate design it encourages non-motorized and public
transportation, fosters conviviality and strengthens
a sense of place.
A related attribute is the need to ensure diversity
and mixed-use neighbourhoods. Through the use of
planning, a variety of housing types is provided, the
location of jobs and housing is balanced and a range
of everyday amenities are located within easy reach.
Mixed-land use promotes non-motorized transport by
increasing proximity and reducing the need to travel,
thus allowing for accomplishing many activities with
shorter and fewer trips. All this is achieved through
the creative deployment of planning and design
and innovative transport engineering and planning
designs.
The quality of the connection between points
of origin and destination is enhanced by the
functionality and inclusiveness of those places and
facilities. The value of access is enhanced by increasing the functionality of each place, thus reducing
not only distances but also the number of trips. Also,
the fostering of inclusiveness and a sense of place
removes inhibitions and promotes identity and
conviviality. Transport engineering design and urban
design are central tools at this level and, as demonstrated in Chapter 5, street configurations, transport
nodes and neighbourhood layouts are the main areas
where interventions take place.
While a lot more research is needed on
integrating freight distribution into the framework
of sustainable urban mobility through planning and
design, there are a few practices that have been
developed and that can contribute to reducing the
prevailing shortcomings of freight distribution in
cities. These include: rationalization of delivery,
improving freight facilities and promoting modal
adaptation. However, it has been noted in the report
that the commercial logic of freight distribution
tends to be at variance with most of the principles
of sustainable urban development.

Realigning transport infrastructure
investment and development
This report acknowledges that the choice of infrastructure investments – particularly budgeting and
financing aspects – is central in determining the
choices and options for sustainable mobility. It is
important that gradual steps are taken to correct
the current imbalance in funding and investments
between private and public modes of transport. More

public resources need to be allocated to facilities that
cater to the needs of the majority of people in both
developed and developing countries. The current bias
towards roads and highways needs to be corrected
so that more funding is assigned to developing and
expanding non-motorized and high-capacity public
transport infrastructure.
It is particularly important that cities investing
in metro, light rail and high-end BRT systems direct
larger shares of future growth to public transport
corridors. Transport-oriented development can
reverse the kind of car-based sprawl that eats into
the green agenda of cities. However, it is important
that a proper alignment between land-use and transport layout is maintained, otherwise the reverse –
i.e. urban sprawl – can be further extended by highcapacity public transport systems.
It is also important that the urban transport
sector is treated as an integrated whole through
systems financing and pricing. This is best accomplished by pooling fiscal resources into a central fund
and distributing them among modes and programmes
in accordance with well-defined objectives, such
as air-quality improvements and reduced traffic
congestion. Such coordinated and centralized
financing is today practised throughout the US,
Canada, Singapore and Japan. Dedicated, long-term
funding is also essential to allow strategic, forwardlooking planning, such as preserving rights of way
for future infrastructure investments. However, it is
important to note that in some cities of developing
countries it is easier to negotiate and secure funding
for metro, light rail or BRT systems than for meeting
the (very marginal) cost of implementing integration
facilities with other urban transport modes – such
as buses, informal share taxis and cars – at metro,
light rail or BRT stations.
Owing to the financial constraints of local
governments and increased interest by private
investors, the global urban transport sector has
witnessed a surge in public–private partnerships.
These partnerships are managed through contracts,
franchises, concessions and, in some instances, the
transport services have undergone full privatization. Public–private partnerships have the potential
to inject efficiencies in the urban transport sector
and also stimulate innovations, such as market-based
pricing and automated toll collection. They may also
draw in private capital where public funding is
restricted. Public–private partnerships have generally
worked best in rapidly growing and urbanizing
countries and regions – such as the Republic of
Korea and Taiwan (China) – and where there is the
institutional capacity to oversee and regulate private
actors. This underscores the need to achieve both
economic and institutional sustainability. However,
this report also highlights the potential dangers of
using public–private partnerships in urban mobility
projects,2 as experiences from a number of cities

indicate that the financial risks in such projects tend
to be carried by the public at large rather than by
the private sector partners involved.
The implementation of principles of economic
efficiency is essential to the urban public transport
sector, since it has major financial implications on
local governments. For instance, while urban rail
systems handle large loads, they do so at very high,
and potentially financially crippling, costs. The high
capital investments and subsequent operating costs
needed to support a metro investment must be
carefully examined to ensure that local and national
governments have the financial capacity to maintain
its services. Unless a city’s urban densities are
comparatively high and financial resources are
plentiful, lower-cost BRT investments – as recently
implemented by cities such as Jakarta (Indonesia),
Ahmedabad (India), Lagos (Nigeria) and Chiang Mai
(Thailand) – present a more practical option for
investment in high-capacity public transport.
A key point made in this report is that the sustainability of urban mobility systems is highly
dependent on the financial models designed to
protect the public goods dimension of both land use
and the transport system. Among other financing
sources, the option of value capture is highly
recommended as a complement to public funding.
Through recouping the increase of value in adjacent
land and converting it into public finance for
reinvestment in urban mobility systems, the linkage
between land use and transport is reinforced. This
approach is also politically appealing as it directly
demonstrates the linkage between charges levied and
the benefits provided.

Integrating urban transport facilities and
service operations
The linkage of transport to land use is not only
limited to the hardware and the physical dimensions
of the two processes. Transport-oriented development and traffic-calming interventions discussed in
this report also involve the systemic and managerial
aspects of ensuring convenience, efficiency, aesthetics and safety of mobility. The operation of multimodal neighbourhood stations; the ambiance
surrounding flow of vehicles, bicycles and pedestrian
in streets; and the procedures at toll-collection points,
have to be synchronized in a manner that ensures a
pleasant mobility experience.
The urban transport sector must ascribe to the
principle of economic efficiency for the simple reason
that waste and unsound expenditures could imply
that scarce financial resources are directed to other
productive and beneficial societal uses, be they education, healthcare or private consumption. Efficient
land-use patterns (e.g. compact, mixed and walkable)
allow for less reliance on expensive mobility systems
in general. Properly designed transport systems also

contribute to business expansion, increased economic
output and employment generation. Indeed, mobility
is indisputably a necessary (though not a sufficient)
precondition to economic growth and expansion.
Efficiency must underpin management, operational and system design practices throughout the
urban transport sector. In the case of high-capacity
public transport systems, this can take the form of
redeploying buses and equipment to high-ridership
markets that produce the highest fare-box returns.
In doing so, it is necessary to adopt the regulations
that allow operators to develop ‘out of fare-box’
financing resources such as value capture, advertising
at stations, stops and vehicles, etc., in order to crosssubsidize services, thus, reducing or eliminating
government subsidies. For non-motorized transport,
it might mean building bikeway overpasses at busy
junctions where careful cost–benefit calculations
reveal a net societal gain. The report highlights the
difficulties faced by cities of developing countries
in securing funding to cover construction and maintenance costs of non-motorized transport infrastructure, from both public and other sources. As
non-motorized transport facilities are not revenue
generating, they are rarely attractive to international
funding agencies or the private sector. Efforts are
needed to reach innovative ideas that point out the
environmental and societal gains made from nonmotorized transport.3 For urban goods movement,
night or off-peak deliveries, freight stations and
consolidation centres that allow shared-use of delivery
vehicles, and bicycle carriers suited to the constraints
of urban circulation, might be called for. For parking,
efficiency might be achieved by installing sensors in
parking stalls to monitor occupancy so that charges
can be varied according to demand and motorists
can be real-time navigated to the closest available
parking space.4
Because transportation is both a private and
a public good – conferring benefits to both individual
users and society at large – a combination of user
charges and public support is often needed to
efficiently and equitably finance transport infrastructure and services. User fees, such as public transport fares and road charges, encourage efficient
behaviour. When fuel taxes rise, increased prices
encourage motorists to acquire more fuel-efficient
vehicles or switch to public transport. Funding transport facilities through general sales, income taxes or
borrowing provides no incentive to be efficient or
socially responsible; as such charges are completely
unrelated to the cost imposed on the transport
system or the benefits received.
Integrated transportation and urban development must occur at all geographic scales. At the micro
level, much is to be gained from advancing the model
of ‘complete streets’, an acknowledgement that
streets serve numerous purposes, not just moving
cars and trucks. The ‘complete streets’ movement,

gaining steam throughout Europe, much of North
America and in parts of Eastern Asia, views road right
of way as ‘public spaces’, managing and even slowing
movements in favour of public transport, walking and
cycling. One example is multi-way boulevards that
provide spaces for cars, buses, pedestrians and sometimes even tramways – packaged with good designs
that emphasize high-quality spaces and safety.5 Nonmotorized modes of transport such as walking and
cycling, enliven a city, promote social interaction and
allow a more physically active lifestyle. Some cities
have gone one step further, reclaiming land once
given over to motorways and freeways to pedestrians, cyclists and public transport. Seoul’s Cheng
Gye Cheon freeway-to-greenway conversion, made
possible in part by expanded BRT services to absorb
lost roadway capacity, has not only reduced innercity traffic congestion but has also been credited with
spurring central-city redevelopment and urban infill.
The 6-kilometre inner-city greenway laced with bike
paths and urban art is today Seoul’s second most
popular tourist destination.6
Progressive projects and programmes – such as
green transport-oriented development and complete
streets – do not suddenly appear, but rather begin
with thoughtful plans and visions. Transport planning
needs to be well integrated with land-use planning at all levels of government. Through both carrots
(e.g. financial aid) and sticks (e.g. regulatory
requirements), national governments are uniquely
positioned to encourage state/provincial, regional
and local institutions to link transport investment and
urban development strategies in master plans, zoning
practices and infrastructure design standards.
Integrated transport and land-use planning development must also be emphasized in national urban
development policies and plans. India’s national
urban transport policy of 2006, for example, embraces integrated transport and land-use planning as
its number-one priority. In fact, half the cost of
preparing integrated transport and land-use plans in
Indian cities is covered by the central government.7

Streamlining urban institutions and
governance framework
Innovative ideas and policies geared towards sustainable mobility require strong institutional and
governance structures to oversee their successful
implementation. Political will, sound leadership,
transparency and accountability are essential in
building public trust. Also vital to the entire process
are the planning institutions, as these are capable of
creating compelling visions of urban futures. Moreover, participatory mechanisms must be in place to
ensure that planning and investment decisions are
socially inclusive and representative of all segments
of society. This implies giving non-state actors and
city residents, such as neighbourhood associations,

a place at the negotiating table when making
important urban mobility decisions. In strengthening
institutions, it is essential that financial resources be
channelled into training and capacity-building of the
concerned personnel in order to empower them to
take on the complex challenges of the urban
transportation sector.
The development of a fully integrated and sustainable multi-modal urban transportation system
requires a robust regional governance structure,
which gives rise to inter-municipal cooperation. This
fosters accountability and provides a territorial
context for coordinating growth and services within
a region’s travel-shed. Regional institutions need to
be endowed with the power of regulatory oversight
and funding capacities to finance transportation
investments and service management.
As noted above, while most of the innovations
introduced in urban transport will come from local
and regional actors, higher levels of government also
have a crucial role to play. National urban transport
policies that promote integrated planning and provide
capital loans and technical assistance can help smaller
cities chart a sustainable urban transport course.8
Brazil has had a national urban transport policy for
over 25 years, helping nurture sustainable transport
practices in BRT-served cities such as Curitiba and
Belo Horizonte. India’s Ministry of Urban Development is today actively promoting transport-oriented
development along planned and existing BRT
corridors through financial support for forming
unified metropolitan transport authorities.9
Technology itself can be an enabler of more
grassroots and inclusive policy-making in urban
transport. Social media, for example, allows likeminded individuals to coalesce and shape public
discourse. In 2008, during a period when the
TransMilenio BRT system in Bogotá, Colombia, was
suffering from problems of extreme overcrowding
and long queues at ticket offices, residents turned
to social media to organize a large public protest.
Active media coverage led to even louder public
outcries, eventually prompting local leaders to
introduce various capacity-expansion initiatives,
including lengthening some of the key modular
stations, expanding services and introducing more
articulated buses.10
There is also a need to inject efficiencies,
accountability and transparency into the urban transport decision-making process. This requires the development and institutionalization of planning processes
and evaluation approaches that are based on objective
measures of performance and tied to well-articulated
goals and hoped-for outcomes. This promotes both
transparency and accountability. At the same time,
there is need for an open and democratic planning
and decision-making process, in particular given the
broad reach of the urban transport sector and its
merits. This will not only bring the voices of all

citizens – women and men, children, the elderly, the
disabled, businesses, governments, NGOs and civil
society at large – to the table, but will also ensure
that the needs of the least advantaged are clearly
recognized and fully acted upon.
Responsibilities for the urban transport sector
are being decentralized across the world, from
Eastern Europe, to Sub-Saharan Africa and SouthEastern Asia. Human and financial resources are
needed for the successful handover of functions and
investment responsibilities from central to local
governments. There is a need for metropolitan
planning and operating authorities that reflect regions
as ‘ecological units’ – i.e. by allowing planning and
governance over a geographic territory that mimics
commute-sheds, trade-sheds and air basins. Human
resource development plans and integrated, viable
and dependable urban transport funding programmes
are also needed.

Readjusting legal and regulatory
instruments
The interventions highlighted above call for changes
in the management of space, the built form, the
engineering of transport, social behaviour, as well as
in the institutional and financing arrangements
related to urban development. These elements are
built upon the legacy of a legal foundation that has
perpetuated mobility systems which this report has
found to be severely wanting. Any transformation
would therefore entail major reform in the legal and
regulatory framework relating to urban management.
For example, the ordinances guiding the planning
process have to be amended away from often applied
segregation of use and rigid zoning towards fostering
more mixed-use and compactness. The same applies
to building codes and standards, mandates and
authority allocated to different institutions, and also
sanctions directed at reducing negative externalities.
While significant progress has been achieved in
some cities, in terms of incorporating the necessary
laws and regulation for realizing some of the above
objectives, much remains to be done. The dire need
for fostering inclusiveness and environmental
protection not only calls for the enactment of a
comprehensive set of statutes, but also requires the
consolidation of enforcement capacity to ensure that
the laws and regulations are abided by.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Urban sustainable mobility as a development issue
cuts across the intersection of the most urgent
challenges confronting the global community today.
Neither the efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, nor the measures being taken to arrest
the growing economic inequalities among and within
nations, can be tackled without also addressing the

issue of sustainable mobility. Similarly, the quest
towards eliminating poverty and fostering shared
prosperity cannot succeed without also redressing the
prevailing distortions in urban mobility systems and
existing impediments on accessing the modern city.
This report has demonstrated that mobility
systems contribute to the morphology of the city,
both in terms of the spatial layout as well as in the
configuration of its built form. In so far as these

two elements are related to the productivity and
dynamism of the city in the broader setting, the
impact of urban mobility is therefore local as well as
macro. The report suggests that along the three key
pillars of sustainable development – and within the
foundations of robust, integrated and participatory
institutions – it is possible to initiate and promote
interventions that can effectively enhance the
accessibility of cities today.

and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed
as a percentage of the maximum area under the line.
Thus, a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality,
while an index of 1 implies absolute inequality.
Gross national income: the sum of value added by
all resident producers plus any product taxes (less
subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus
net receipts of primary income (compensation of
employees and property income) from abroad. Data
are in current US dollars converted using the World
Bank Atlas method.
Gross national income per capita: gross national
income (GNI) divided by mid-year population. GNI
per capita in US dollars is converted using the World
Bank Atlas method.
Gross national income PPP: gross national income
converted to international dollars using purchasing
power parity (PPP) rates. An international dollar has
the same purchasing power over GNI as a US dollar
has in the United States of America.
Household: the concept of household is based on
the arrangements made by persons, individually or
in groups, for providing themselves with food or other
essentials for living. A household may be either:
1. A one-person household: a person who makes
provision for his or her own food or other
essentials for living without combining with any
other person to form a part of a multi-person
household.
2. A multi-person household: a group of two or more
persons living together who make common
provision for food or other essentials for living.
The persons in the group may pool their incomes
and may, to a greater or lesser extent, have a
common budget; they may be related or unrelated
persons or constitute a combination of persons
both related and unrelated. This concept of household is known as the ‘housekeeping’ concept. It
does not assume that the number of households
and housing units is equal. Although the concept
of housing unit implies that it is a space occupied by one household, it may also be occupied
by more than one household or by a part of a
household (e.g. two nuclear households that share
one housing unit for economic reasons or one
household in a polygamous society routinely
occupying two or more housing units).
Household connection to improved drinking
water: percentage of households that, within their
housing unit, are connected to any of the following
types of water supply for drinking: piped water,
public tap, borehole or pump, protected well,
protected spring or rainwater.
Improved drinking water coverage: percentage of
people using improved drinking water sources or

delivery points. Improved drinking water technologies
are more likely to provide safe drinking water than
those characterized as unimproved. Improved
drinking water sources: piped water into dwelling,
plot or yard; public tap/standpipe; tube well/borehole;
protected dug well; protected spring; rainwater
collection. Unimproved drinking water sources:
unprotected dug well; unprotected spring; cart with
small tank/drum; bottled water;2 tanker-truck; surface
water (river, dam, lake, pond, stream, canal, irrigation
channels).
Improved sanitation coverage: percentage of
people using improved sanitation facilities. Improved
sanitation facilities are more likely to prevent human
contact with human excreta than unimproved
facilities.
International poverty line: based on nationally
representative primary household surveys conducted
by national statistical offices or by private agencies
under the supervision of government or international
agencies and obtained from government statistical
offices and World Bank country departments.
(Population below US$1.25 a day and Population
below US$2 a day): percentages of the population
living on less than $1.25 a day and $2 a day at 2005
international prices. As a result of revisions in PPP
exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries
cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in
earlier editions
Level of urbanization: percentage of the population
residing in places classified as urban. Urban and
rural settlements are defined in the national context
and vary among countries (the definitions of urban
are generally national definitions incorporated within
the latest census).
National population below national poverty line:
percentage of the country’s population living below
the national poverty line. National estimates are
based on population weighted subgroup estimates
from household surveys.
Persons in housing units: number of persons
resident in housing units.
Population, rural: mid-year estimates and
projections (medium variant) of the population
residing in human settlements classified as rural (see
also ‘Population, urban’ below).
Population, total: mid-year population estimates
and projections for the world, region, countries or
areas. The Population Division of the United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs updates,
every two years, population estimates and projections
by incorporating new data, new estimates and new
analyses of data on population, fertility, mortality and
international migration. Data from new population
censuses and/or demographic surveys are used to

209

210

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

verify and update old estimates of population or
demographic indicators, or to make new ones and
to check the validity of the assumptions made in the
projections. Population rate of change (calculated by
UN-Habitat) refers to the average annual percentage
change of population during the indicated period for
each country, major regions and global totals. The
formula used throughout the annex is as follows: r
= [(1/t) x ln(A2/A1)] x 100, where ‘A1’ is a value at
any given year; ‘A2’ is a value at any given year later
than the year of ‘Al’; ‘t’ is the year interval between
‘Al’ and ‘A2’; and ‘ln’ is the natural logarithm function.
Population, urban: mid-year population of areas
defined as urban in each country and reported to the
United Nations. Estimates of the world’s urban
population would change significantly if China, India,
and a few other populous nations were to change
their definition of urban centres. According to China’s
State Statistical Bureau, by the end of 1996 urban
residents accounted for about 43 percent of China’s
population, while in 1994 only 20 percent of the
population was considered urban. In addition to the
continuous migration of people from rural to urban
areas, one of the main reasons for this shift was the
rapid growth in the hundreds of towns reclassified
as cities in recent years. Because the estimates in
the table are based on national definitions of what
constitutes a city or metropolitan area, cross-country
comparisons should be made with caution.
Population density: mid-year population divided by
land area in square kilometres.
Pump price for fuels: refer to the pump prices of
the most widely sold grade of petrol and of diesel
fuel. Prices have been converted from the local
currency to US dollars.
Railways: length of railway route available for train
service, irrespective of the number of parallel tracks.
Passengers carried by railway are the number of
passengers (in millions) transported by rail multiplied by kilometres travelled (m-p-km). Goods hauled
by railway are the volume of goods transported by
railway, measured in metric tons multiplied by
kilometres travelled (m-t-km).
Road motor vehicles: include cars, buses and freight
vehicles but not two-wheelers.
Road traffic deaths: any person killed immediately
or dying within 30 days as a result of a road traffic
accident.
Passenger cars: refer to road motor vehicles, other
than two-wheelers, intended for the carriage of
passengers and designed to seat no more than nine
people (including the driver). Other motor vehicles:
road motor vehicles exclusive of passenger cars.

Roads: motorways, highways, main or national roads,
and secondary or regional roads. A motorway is a road
specially designed and built for motor vehicles that
separates the traffic flowing in opposite directions.
Total road network: includes motorways, highways
and main or national roads, secondary or regional
roads, and all other roads in a country. Paved roads:
roads surfaced with crushed stone (macadam) and
hydrocarbon binder or bitumized agents, with
concrete or with cobblestones, as a percentage of all
of the country’s roads measured in length. Passengers carried by roads are the number of people (in
millions) transported by road multiplied by kilometres
travelled (m-p-km). Goods hauled by road are the
volume of goods transported by road vehicles,
measured in millions of metric tons multiplied by
kilometres travelled (m-t-km).
Survey year: the year in which the underlying data
were collected.
Urban poverty rate: percentage of the urban
population living below the national urban poverty
line.
Urban slum dwellers: individuals residing in
housing with one or more of the following conditions:
inadequate drinking water; inadequate sanitation;
poor structural quality/durability of housing; overcrowding; and insecurity of tenure.
Urban agglomerations and capital cities: the
term ‘urban agglomeration’ refers to the population
contained within the contours of a contiguous
territory inhabited at urban density levels without
regard to administrative boundaries. It usually incorporates the population in a city or town plus that
in the suburban areas lying outside of but being
adjacent to the city boundaries. Whenever possible,
data classified according to the concept of urban
agglomeration are used. However, some countries do
not produce data according to the concept of urban
agglomeration but use instead that of metropolitan
area or city proper. If possible, such data are adjusted
to conform to the concept of urban agglomeration.
When sufficient information is not available to permit
such an adjustment, data based on the concept of
city proper or metropolitan area are used. The sources
listed online indicate whether data were adjusted
to conform to the urban agglomeration concept or
whether a different concept was used. Table C.1
contains revised estimates and projections for all
urban agglomerations comprising 750,000 or more
inhabitants.

Notes:
(1) Lists of countries/areas in aggregates are presented in the Technical Notes.
(2) Developing regions.
(3) Trends data are not available for Oceania. A constant figure does not mean there is no change. Data are for Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia only (i.e. it excludes Australia and New Zealand).
Sources: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2012) World Urbanization Prospects: The 2011 Revision, United Nations, New York. Figures in regional, income or development
aggregates are calculated on the basis of country/area level data from Table B.3 United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), Global Urban Indicators Database 2012.
