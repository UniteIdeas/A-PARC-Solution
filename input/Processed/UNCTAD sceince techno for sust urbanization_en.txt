I. Introduction

I. Introduction
The past two decades have witnessed the
emergence of the new developmental
phenomenon of urbanization. Cities are not
only the engines of economic growth but
also increasingly spaces of shared social,
cultural and economic experiences (United
Nations Human Settlements Programme (UNHabitat), 2005). Urbanization is synonymous
to most people in the developing world with
job creation and poverty reduction. Yet while
some cities across the world have managed to
benefit from urbanization as a developmental
tool by applying the right policies, others
have merely moved poverty to urban areas. In
addition, various examples from around the
world demonstrate that being a developed
country is not a prerequisite for sound
urbanization that contributes to economic
development.
Urbanization has accompanied large-scale
improvements in some developing countries
towards the Millennium Development Goals.
The most important change has been the
eradication of extreme poverty in rural areas,
for instance in China. Such progress has
depended primarily on the role of cities in
employment generation and their ability to
provide basic services such as water, health
and sanitation for the masses at a lower cost
than in rural areas.
The next wave of urbanization represents
an opportunity to meet the Millennium
Development Goals and raise people out
of poverty. Moving to cities may provide
employment, health and sanitation all at
once to citizens of developing countries.
Despite this, urbanization is a core concern
that developing countries struggle with, with
many common issues. Developing countries
need to find ways to accommodate growing
demands on their cities to ensure that the
social, cultural and environmental needs of
their citizens are met. Cities need to envisage
policies that bridge growing urban divides
that translate not only into unfair economic
opportunities but also unfair access to

services. Cities should aim to become shared
spheres of prosperity.
Urbanization is a key environmental issue as
well. The rapid pace at which urbanization is
taking place in the developing world has an
impact on climate change and other global
environmental issues. Cities account for
more than two-thirds of the global energy
demand and result in up to 80 per cent
of global greenhouse gas emissions. The
urban planning and investment choices
that a few large developing countries will
make therefore represent one of the most
important environmental issues of the
twenty-first century. Entire new industries are
forming with the aim of switching to clean
and renewable energies and managing the
world’s resources in a more efficient manner,
primarily in developed countries but also in
the developing world.
In recent years, sustainable urbanization
has become a very popular topic. Several
conferences at international, regional and
local levels have periodically discussed
urbanization issues in detail. Debate on the
topic has already reached a level of maturity
whereby tools, resources and applications
are abundant worldwide. Innovation on
sustainable urbanization is happening
everywhere, in both developed and
developing countries.
This report aims to contribute to the sustainable urbanization discourse by addressing the specific role of science, technology
and innovation. It is based on literature review and an analysis of cities in developed
and developing countries that provide examples that can be reapplied elsewhere.
The report provides a fresh perspective on
the discussion on sustainable urbanization, drawing on current research and case
studies from around the world. The report
identifies key sectoral planning challenges
posed by rapid urbanization, particularly in
developing countries, and proposes prac-

2

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

tical guidelines to city planners and other
decision makers for addressing these challenges through the use of science, technology and innovation.
The publication draws on lessons learned
from panels organized by the United Nations
Commission on Science and Technology
for Development on the topic of science,
technology and innovation for sustainable
cities and peri-urban communities during its
2012–2013 intersessional panel, held in Lima,
Peru in January 2013, and its sixteenth session,
held in Geneva, Switzerland in June 2013.

Chapter II reviews global urbanization
trends and the case for sustainable urban
development. Chapter III proposes science,
technology and innovation options with
examples of policy considerations on the
path towards sustainable urban planning.
Chapter IV looks at ways in which science,
technology and innovation can improve
resource management in an urban setting.
Finally, chapter V discusses policy implications
with regard to increasing the diffusion
and adoption of science, technology and
innovation for sustainable urbanization in
developing countries.

II. Urbanization and sustainability

II. Urbanization and sustainability
This chapter discusses current urbanization
trends, the relationship between urbanization
and the attainment of the Millennium
Development Goals and the need to foster
sustainable urbanization for improved
outcomes in developing countries.

II. a. Trends of urbanization
According to the world development
indicators of the World Bank, people living in
urban areas represented 52.6 per cent of the
world’s population in 2012. It is estimated that
by 2050 the number of inhabitants of urban
areas will increase from the current 3.5 billion
to 6.2 billion, which will approximately
constitute more than two-thirds of the global
population. The unprecedented pace of
urbanization in developing countries, where
more than 90 per cent of urban population

growth will occur over the next 30 years, is the
main driver of this trend. Most of this growth
will be attributed to mid-size towns.
Table 1 shows urbanization trends by
development group. The growth of urban
areas until 2050 will primarily take place in
developing Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Rural areas of both developed and developing
regions will stagnate and urban populations
of developed regions will incur a very small
increase. It is expected that the urban
population of sub-Saharan Africa will double,
to reach almost 600 million by 2030.
Urbanization and the Millennium
Development Goals
Urbanization is mainly stimulated by
economic factors. People move to cities
in search of jobs and a better quality of life.

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Cities generate four-fifths of the global gross
domestic product with just over half of the
world’s population, on 2 per cent of the earth’s
surface (Department of Economic and Social
Affairs – Population Division, 2012). Most new
jobs are created in cities; 60 per cent of the
increase in the global gross domestic product
between 2010 and 2025 is expected to come
from 600 cities (Gapper, 2012).
Urbanization in the developing world
has been a major contributor to progress
towards attaining some of the Millennium
Development Goals, such as those related to
poverty, sanitation and health. This is to be
expected, given that on average a 10 per
cent increase in a country’s urban population
results in a 30 per cent increase in that
country’s per capita output. In addition, per
capita incomes are almost four times higher
in majority-urban countries in comparison to
majority-rural countries (Glaeser, 2011).
In addition to their role in alleviating poverty
through their economic dynamism, cities also
make public services more accessible (World
Bank and International Monetary Fund, 2013).
Due to the economies of scale achieved
through their higher density, it is less costly
to provide piped water, sanitation, education
and health care services in urban areas. The
provision of such services is directly linked to the
Millennium Development Goals. For instance,
in sub-Saharan Africa, urbanization facilitated
half of the decline in poverty. In addition, nearly
30 per cent of improvements on target 7.C1
was achieved by urbanization (World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, 2013).
Growing urban divides in all spheres
Urbanization has raised the standard of living for
many by offering employment opportunities
and better public services. However, it also
comes with important challenges, particularly
for developing countries. In many parts of the
world, urbanization has not taken place in a
socially inclusive manner. Many developing
countries have not been able to predict and

sanitation.

prepare for the rapid pace of urbanization
that is in progress. Even where the trend is
predictable, cities are unable to address the
needs of growing populations and cope
with surging requirements for housing,
physical infrastructure, including roads and
telecommunications technologies, and social
services, such as health and education. The
continuation of current urbanization patterns
in the developing world could lead to urban
decay and a low quality of life, adversely
affecting the economic growth of developing
countries.
Although urbanization itself is not the cause of
poverty, unplanned urbanization is resulting in
the shift of poverty to urban areas in developing
countries. In 2012, urban poverty was already
a serious issue: 525 million urban inhabitants
lived on under $1 per day, while 1.2 billion
citizens lived on under $2 per day. The growth
of slums has been inevitable, representing
38 per cent of urban growth around the
world and three-quarters of urban population
growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The global slum
population has been growing by more than
20 million additional slum dwellers per year and
will reach a projected total of 1.4 billion in 2020.
In Africa, more than half of urban citizens live in
informal settlements, where the water supply
and sanitation are severely inadequate. Climate
change is exacerbating the risk of disasters for
populations living in such inadequate shelters.
The growth of slums has a direct impact on the
attainment of the Millennium Development
Goals in cities. In 2007–2008, UN-Habitat,
the United Nations Human Settlements
Programme, measured indicators of progress
towards the Millennium Development
Goals in slums and other areas of 200 cities
globally. The study indicated that slum
dwellers die earlier, experience more hunger,
are less educated, have fewer chances for
employment and suffer more ill health than
the rest of the urban population.

II. b. Sustainable urbanization
It is due to these trends that there is a need
to focus on sustainable urbanization, in
terms of what can be considered sustainable

II. Urbanization and sustainability

Box 1.

New York City: Measuring
sustainability

New York City has launched PlaNYC, a comprehensive
agenda that includes long-term targets for enhancing infrastructure, the environment, quality of life and
the economy to accommodate an additional 1 million
people until 2030. PlaNYC measures 29 sustainability
indicators in categories including housing, parks, public
transport, water supply, energy eﬃciency and air quality
through a dedicated oﬃce of long-term planning and
sustainability.

or unsustainable in the future and how
to address the issue. There is no generally
agreed common definition of sustainability or
sustainable urbanization. However, there is a
growing set of areas and actions that together
constitute the benchmarks for sustainable
urbanization. The definition continues to
evolve and higher standards are set.
The economic, social and environmental
effects of uncontrolled rapid urbanization
are increasing awareness of the need for
sustainable practices. Large-scale events such
as the Olympics are increasingly evaluated
on whether they incorporate legacy projects
that plan the reuse of facilities following the
event. New ecological cities are planned and
constructed that rely fully on sustainable
technologies. In addition, cities are
increasingly setting goals and measuring their
sustainability by using indicators such as the
availability of shelter and safe drinking water,
urban density, public space as a percentage
of urban area, energy efficiency of buildings,
share of renewable energy sources, access
and proximity to mass transit, wastewater
treatment, number of road traffic fatalities,
solid waste management and recycling (UNHabitat, 2012c). box 1 presents an example of
measuring sustainability in the United States
of America.
The definition of sustainability in the urban
context can be divided into the subsections
of smart, environmentally friendly, prosperous
and socially inclusive cities, as follows:
• Smart cities cover the needs of their
citizens adequately. They offer high-quality

5

services, including mobility, habitat and
public space.
• Environmentally friendly cities manage their
resources efficiently. They minimize waste
and promote environmental awareness
among citizens and environmentally
friendly buildings and construction
materials to reduce energy consumption.
• Prosperous cities maximize economic
opportunities by tapping into the
competitive advantages of their locations,
not only at the city level but beyond,
covering the region, in order to attract
entrepreneurship and new economic
activity.
• Socially inclusive cities strive to increase
quality of life for all citizens regardless of
income levels, through increasing safety by
addressing crime, stimulating economic
opportunities for the poor and integrating
informal areas, and practising governance
that involves the public in decision-making
structures.
Sustainable urbanization can thus cover
all actions that lead to a more efficient
management of land and resources,
improved mobility, economic dynamism,
higher environmental quality, safety, security,
access to urban services and social cohesion.
Generally, the relevant literature accepts
sustainable cities as those that have sound
spatial plans that address the needs of their
population, ensure the circulation of people
through sound mobility systems and use their
resources efficiently, and even manage to
build a circular economy through means such
as recycling. This definition may be seen as the
narrow definition of sustainable urbanization.
In the broader sense, sustainable urbanization
also addresses social policies, including for
reducing crime and ensuring social justice,
funding models and governance structures.
Since science, technology and innovation are
more relevant to and have a stronger impact
on sectors included in the narrow definition
of sustainable urbanization, this report will
cover their role accordingly.

6

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Sustainable urbanization comes at a cost. In
the next 10 years, more than $10 trillion will
need to be invested in urban infrastructure in
Asia and Latin America (Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific et al.,
2011). In the period until 2030, twenty times
the infrastructure capacity added during the
past decade is needed for roads and public
transport across the world. The estimated
rate of urbanization in China and India until
2050, outlined in box 2, attests to the scale of
investments required to address the needs of
growing urban populations in terms of jobs,
housing, basic services and infrastructure.
Furthermore, urban population growth
and steadily rising incomes result in higher
resource consumption. Cities around the
world, especially rapidly growing cities in Asia,
Africa and Latin America, need to find ways to
delink urban economic growth from resource
consumption. Urbanization is creating crosssectoral governance challenges, including
Box 2.

imbalances in quality of life and other social
issues that need to be addressed through
integrated multi-stakeholder mechanisms.
Urbanization is a multidimensional and
complex process. Due to the wide scope of the
topic, sustainable urbanization is addressed
by several international organizations, such
as UN-Habitat. It encompasses several
dimensions, some of which are addressed
through policies that are beyond the realm
of science, technology and innovation. For
example, addressing the topic of housing
versus habitat concerns not only construction
but several other departments, since habitat
includes the provision of access to jobs as
well as housing. Science, technology and
innovation are key enablers of sustainable
urbanization, yet not the only ones, and
have prerequisites such as local regulations,
capacity-building
and
accountability.
Science, technology and innovation are part
of comprehensive initiatives to improve

Urbanization in the developing world is led by China and India. The urban population of China is expected to increase from
just above 10 per cent in 1950 to almost 80 per cent in 2050. In India, urbanization has been slower but will accelerate after
2020 to pass the 50 per cent threshold in 2050. Urbanization will continue to drive increases in national income in both
countries. For instance, 70 per cent of all new jobs in India will be created in urban areas, with twice the productivity level
of equivalent jobs in rural areas. Cities will drive social inclusion as well since public infrastructure, such as for water and
sanitation, is more aﬀordable in urban areas than in sparsely populated areas.

cities, along with other components such as
leadership, urban governance, regulation and
financing.
This report, which is part of the UNCTAD series
on current studies on science, technology
and innovation, focuses on their specific role
in bringing about sustainable urbanization in
developing countries and how to strengthen
this role. Therefore, for the purposes of this
report, sustainability refers to all practices
based on science, technology and innovation
that lead to an improved quality of life for
urban citizens.

II. c. Role of science,
technology and innovation
in the urban context
Science, technology and innovation are key
elements of sustainable urbanization and
will play a growing role as such. Their use
may not solve all urbanization problems,
yet can provide a multitude of solutions
that can be leveraged by cities. The use
of science, technology and innovation in
the urban context implies the application
of both high and low technology and
innovative approaches to urban planning
and institutional innovation. Science,
technology and innovation approaches are
widely available for cities to draw upon, yet
cities are complex structures that require
integrated responses to their problems and
there are sometimes difficulties related to
such integration.
Although this report separately analyses
the various sectors that are important for
sustainable urbanization, it is necessary for
urban planners and managers to address
issues with an intersectoral mindset. Urban
systems need to be designed with multiple
uses in mind. Science, technology and
innovation offer a range of related options,
including high technology, low technology
and innovative governance. Combining
science, technology and innovation to solve
urban problems is often contextual, although
there are several good practices to draw
upon from cities across the globe.

Science,
technology
and
innovation
contribute to sustainable urbanization in
a variety of ways, including with regard
to new capabilities in spatial planning,
socioeconomic
research,
enhancing
cooperation between urban departments,
optimizing mobility and enabling sustainable
resource management. A science, technology
and innovation-oriented mindset also brings
about innovative models of thinking in
urban governance, such as for participatory
budgeting and regional urban planning.
Finally, science, technology and innovation
contribute to social inclusion by improving
the tools available to urban planners to
respond to the needs of excluded groups
and to increase sensitivity to gender equality.
Each urban setting faces different challenges
and has different technology needs. In some
cases, inexpensive and readily available
technologies may be the best solution to
urban problems. For example, intermodal
transport services can be designed without
necessarily requiring expensive hightechnology means of transport. Promoting
bicycles, an affordable, healthy, clean and
energy-efficient technology, may be the best
option to improve mobility in many cities, for
both younger and older citizens.
Furthermore, innovation, which in the urban
context may refer to any new method,
business model, policy, institutional design
or regulation, could meet the needs of urban
populations in a more efficient, effective and
sustainable way. For instance, improved rules
or legislation, as well as improved institutions,
stakeholder participation models and new
means of delivering services, can contribute
to sustainable urbanization. As a final point,
high technology, low technology and urban
innovation can also be integrated to address
a specific urban issue in harmony.

II. d. Cities as systems
A sociotechnical system is the way humans
and technologies work together to
produce outcomes. The answers to societal
challenges cannot be expected to come
from technologies alone but rather from how

8

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

technologies are developed and used in the
overall development process. For example,
a transportation system is not only vehicles
and roadways but also how people drive, ride,
build and maintain them. The city itself can be
viewed as a complex sociotechnical system
that addresses the needs of densely settled
communities. Science, technology and
innovation approaches may therefore be seen
not merely as technologies but within the
context of the urban sociotechnical system.
Cities are ultimately places where humans
live and must therefore address human
needs and aspirations. When envisaging
science, technology and innovation for
cities, it is necessary to ensure harmony
between engineered systems and design
and architectural concerns. For example,
when planning roads with a technocratic
mindset, one might achieve perfection in
terms of engineering, yet actually destroy the
fabric of a city as a place where people enjoy
living, as is often true in the use of elevated
highways. Cities provide science, technology
and innovation with an opportunity to
produce benefits for large populations, if
the related solutions are applied to address
human needs.
Science, technology and innovation are key
ingredients for sustainable urbanization in
developing countries, yet not the only ones,
and have prerequisites to be effective, such as
institutional and regulatory reform, socially inclusive policymaking, the availability of funds
and the establishment of partnerships. Cities
need to be viewed as complete sociotechnical systems in order for science, technology
and innovation-related solutions to be effec-

tive, and such solutions will be ineffective if
other policies do not complement them. Science, technology and innovation drive sociotechnical change, yet city leaders need to
increase the awareness of citizens to the urgency of sociotechnical change for their own
well-being and quality of life. Such solutions
also need to be accompanied by leadership,
a supportive regulatory environment, education and citizen participation. One simple way
to explain the positioning of science, technology and innovation as part of a comprehensive framework of policies leading to sustainable urbanization is through the example of
bicycle-sharing programmes. Such initiatives
cannot succeed without dedicated lanes,
laws that clarify priorities in traffic and, most
importantly, education and awareness-raising
so that citizens no longer rely on their automobiles for all travel.
Within an urban sociotechnical system, more
positive outcomes may be achieved if cities
are designed with an intersectoral mindset,
for instance when addressing energy, water
and public health in an integrated manner.
In some cases, the best application of
science, technology and innovation may be
a combination of low and high technology
in one package and it is necessary for
city management to find an appropriate
balance. For example, building design,
energy consumption and mobility are closely
interlinked; taller buildings may negatively
affect exposure to sunlight, reducing the
potential for the use of solar panels, and street
width affects the capacity to accommodate
multiple modes of transport, as well as the
architecture of buildings.

III. Sustainable urban planning

III. Sustainable urban planning
This chapter addresses how science,
technology and innovation can contribute to
sustainable urban planning in order to address
issues such as urban sprawl, traffic congestion
and natural hazards. The chapter presents
several important uses of science, technology
and innovation in areas such as spatial
planning, mobility and disaster resilience. This
is not an exhaustive list but rather a selection
of highly relevant uses, to draw attention
to the potential of science, technology
and innovation. Several cities around the
world are already using innovative planning,
technology and governance models in
sectors such as spatial planning and mobility
to address these complex challenges.

III. a. Density, land use and
spatial planning
This report first considers spatial planning
in its sectoral analysis of sustainable urban
development as it is a cross-cutting theme
that affects all other sectors. Urbanization
in developing countries takes place with
little long-term spatial planning and is
driven by the short-term profitability
expectations of the real-estate sector. Even
planned development strategies sometimes
underestimate the pace of urbanization. For
example, the 1995 plan for Shanghai, China
estimated a population of 15 million by 2020,
yet the city had already reached 16 million
inhabitants in 2000.
Current research in urban planning promotes
more compact and dense spatial planning
for cities. There are several ways in which
increasing density may be beneficial for cities
with growing populations. The following
section discusses alternatives for how to
achieve this.
Urban sprawl and its effects
Unplanned urbanization often results in
urban sprawl, which is commonly defined

as single-use low-density urbanization and
has several negative dimensions. Whereas
urban sprawl was previously associated with
North American cities, it is rapidly extending
to cities across the developing world
(Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific et al., 2011). The density of
urban areas in terms of number of people per
hectare is decreasing across the world due
to uncontrolled urban sprawl. Lower density
makes it more challenging and expensive
to provide adequate public services such
as transport and utilities (UN-Habitat,
2012c). Unplanned urbanization results in
investments that dictate future urban land
and resource consumption patterns. It is
costly to replace such investments with more
sustainable infrastructure later on since they
lock in the options of urban planners (UNHabitat, 2012c).
As a result of unplanned urbanization, millions
of people live in informal settlements on the
periphery of cities without access to basic
services, water and sanitation due to the lack
of funds to carry out important infrastructure
projects. For example, large shortfalls in water
supply have increasingly been experienced
in Lagos, Nigeria, where official supplies
barely meet half the level of demand due to
population growth, insufficient infrastructure,
illegal connections, poor maintenance
and inadequate access to limited supplies
(Worldwatch Institute, 2007).
Urban sprawl is also damaging the
environment and affecting the livelihood
of communities located in the immediate
vicinity of cities by covering land that could
otherwise be utilized for agriculture, tourism or
recreational activities. For example, significant
damage has been caused to environmentally
sensitive areas around the following cities:
São Paulo, Brazil; San José, Costa Rica; Panama
City, Panama; and Caracas, the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela (Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific et al.,
2011).

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Science, technology and innovation for
spatial planning
Cities can accommodate growing populations
in accordance with their land use, spatial
design and density plans by combining
several regulatory instruments. Table 2
provides examples of regulatory instruments
for land use and spatial planning that can
contribute to sustainable growth in cities.

Information and communications technologies play a key role in enabling and enforcing
regulatory measures such as the above for the
spatial planning of urban areas. For example,
city planners can use simulation, modelling
and visualization technologies to aid longterm planning and investment decisions
(Dodgson and Gann, 2011). Geospatial tools
can identify infill zones such as abandoned
land or buildings that are suitable for redevel-

compact city development with a hierarchy of higher-density mixed-use clusters
around public transport nodes.

Density bonus

Providing development bonuses that allow increased development rights, for
example extra floor area with respect to standard planning regulations, for green
projects that support citywide and local sustainability.

Special planning powers

Establishing urban development corporations or urban regeneration companies to
promote and enable green projects.

Vehicle and traffic regulation

Introducing regulation for vehicle types, emission standards, speed limits and road
space allocation that favours green transport, especially green public transport.

Parking standards

Providing maximum rather than minimum parking standards; reducing
private automobile parking standards to a minimum, for example less than
one automobile per household, especially in areas of high public transport
accessibility.

Car-free developments

Providing planning incentives for car-free developments in higher-density areas
with high public transport accessibility.

The ﬂoor area ratio is the most common density measure for planning purposes and is calculated by adding all the area of residential
and business ﬂoor spaces and dividing it by the entire area of the development site (United Nations Environment Programme, 2011).

Oman: Use of information and communications technologies for
spatial planning

Information and communications technologies are increasingly being used in the form of geospatial applications in
urban areas. Oman, in partnership with the International Society of City and Regional Planners, is developing a planning information system as part of its national spatial strategy. The system will become the central hub for all types
of spatial data in the country, supplied by data from multiple national institutions. It will be complemented by a
capacity-building programme in order that the system may be managed locally. Data will be linked to a map and the
system will help access information on serviced land in Oman, such as with regard to utility networks, by overlaying
different types of data.

opment and plan for their reallocation. Geospatial data can be used for scenario planning
to envision future urban development that
is consistent with a city’s historic and current
development path. Geospatial tools can also
combine statistical information with satellite maps to run analyses such as on poverty
targeting, urban infrastructure and transport
planning and socioeconomic analyses such
as crime statistics and the tracking of illegal
settlements (UNCTAD, 2012a). In Bangkok,
Thailand spatial data is used to analyse flood
risks and improve the security of tenure in
informal settlements. box 3 provides an example of the use of information and communications technologies for spatial planning in
Oman.
Policy considerations
Developing spatial plans in the early phases
of urbanization based on the political
consensus of stakeholders, support from
the private sector and outside assistance
or investment can prevent the later waste
of financial resources. Spatial plans are
the strategic decisions of cities on spatial
design and density that take into account
population growth estimates, topographic
characteristics and the capacity to implement
related changes (UN-Habitat, 2012c).
The main spatial design options to
accommodate population growth are as
follows:
• Increasing density
• Extending the city

• Multiplying nodes by building satellite
towns
Spatial planning can optimize the density
of cities according to urban development
goals and enable public services that achieve
economies of scale. Increasing urban density
can save costs arising from the provision
of basic services to scarcely inhabited and
extended city outskirts. It can also be beneficial
in terms of encouraging public transport. For
example, high density in central Hong Kong
(China) allows 85 per cent of all trips to be
made by using public transport (UN-Habitat,
2012c).
Increasing density can be a solution for
physical limitations on urban growth, as is
often seen in city-States such as Singapore
or cities of small island developing States.
Academic research has shown that higher
population density in cities leads to more
face-to-face interactions between citizens,
which results in a superlinear acceleration of
innovation, wealth creation and productivity.
At the same time, too much density is also
not advisable since it can result in the overuse
of public infrastructure that will depreciate
early. Research in 247 large counties in the
United States identified that public spending
first decreases with higher density but can
increase after a tipping point (UN-Habitat,
2012c).
Densification policies can be coupled with
innovative models of urban development.
On high-value public land that is covered
by slums, local governments can implement

12

Innovative spatial design strategies in practice

Portland, United States, is a city that experiences relatively stable population growth and its spatial design was
therefore based on increasing density. The city established an urban growth boundary and prioritized infill development by regenerating brownfield areas and replacing degraded buildings with new ones that had a higher
capacity.
Cape Town, South Africa, adopted a densification policy in February 2012 in order to address challenges of rapid
low-density development such as long travel distances, loss of agricultural land and operational inefficiencies (City
of Cape Town, 2012). The policy supports the increase of average gross density through the subdivision or consolidation of plots, in order to make room for redevelopment at higher densities. Objectives include the efficient use
of infrastructure, development of public transport, protection of the environment, revitalization of city life through
mixed land uses and the development of attractive and safe urban environments.
If a city grows faster than 1 to 2 per cent per year, infill development may not be sufficient and extending the city at
its fringes may be required. The Commissioners’ Plan of 1811, the original design plan for the streets of Manhattan,
was a far-sighted extension plan that foresaw such gradual expansion.
For cities with even higher growth rates, establishing satellite towns in the vicinity of major cities may be an appropriate solution, as envisaged in the Comprehensive Plan 1999–2010 of Shanghai, which includes nine satellite
towns that will receive migration from rural areas. Moreover, building strong links between cities within a region,
as occurs in Seoul, Republic of Korea, can lead to new possibilities for cooperation such as joint financing, sharing
infrastructure with other towns and joint regional governance mechanisms to manage transport, waste and water
resources.

slum-upgrading programmes for the benefit
of all stakeholders. They can propose
improved housing for occupants of slums
in higher modern buildings on parts of the
same land. The private sector can construct
these buildings free of cost in return for
development rights in other zones of
the city. As a result, the city can upgrade
infrastructure at no cost, optimize land use
and create open space on valuable land with
the help of vertical resettlement (Gill and
Bhide, 2012).
Spatial plans can include regional integration
aspects. Cities are located in regions and
should undertake metropolitan strategic
planning for integration with their regions
and not only in the jurisdiction area of the
metropolitan zone to which they belong.
Various spatial design strategies can be
implemented depending on the needs
of the specific urban area. box 4 provides
examples of cities that have implemented
innovative spatial design strategies.
Spatial planning that includes public
transport networks from the very beginning
is a key factor in helping to prioritize public

transport. Cities can be designed by locating
mixed-use developments and jobs near
intermodal public transport connections,
thereby
minimizing
dependence
on
automobiles and reducing the distance that
people need to travel. Spatial design should
plan for integrating the incoming population
into the public transport system. Each mode
of public transport requires a minimum
density to be economical, and the choice
between buses, trams and light rail may be
identified accordingly. For example, a density
of 20 persons per hectare generally makes
urban zones dependent on automobiles. As
of 60 persons per hectare public transport
starts to be economical and as of 150 persons
per hectare walking and bicycling may be
considered practical transport modes.

III. b. Mobility
Automobile travel as an inefficient
mode of transport
Population growth and rapid migration to
cities make it harder to predict and plan
potential public transport routes that can

III. Sustainable urban planning

answer the needs of inhabitants. As mentioned
in the previous section, in low-density cities
it is more difficult to introduce cost-efficient
public transport due to increased distances
and a decreased number of people per trip. It
takes years to reverse transport strategies that
do not answer the needs of citizens, due to
the cost and scale of underlying investments.
Investing in automobile infrastructure
causes lock-in that multiplies investment
needs for a later shift to means of public
transport. Moreover, low population density
results in higher per capita transport energy
consumption.
Mobility based on fossil fuel-powered
automobiles is increasingly becoming a
liability for the world’s cities. In many cities,
automobile ownership is too costly for the
majority of inhabitants, for example in Nairobi,
Kenya, where only 1 in 7 inhabitants has an
automobile (UN-Habitat, 2012c). Prioritizing
automobile travel excludes most of the
population from adequate means of transport.
Automobiles are the most spatially inefficient
transport mode, as they can carry only 2,000
people per hour on a 3.5 metre-wide lane in
the city, in comparison with 20,000 people via
a single-lane bus rapid transit system (Asian
Development Bank and German Agency for
International Cooperation, 2011).
Traffic congestion causes economic damage
to cities. For example, Bangkok is losing
6 per cent of its gross domestic product to
congestion, a percentage comparable to
the tourism sector of the city, which produces
7 per cent of the gross domestic product.
In Mexico City, Mexico the average daily
commute time is 2.5 hours, creating a loss
of 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product
(Glaeser, 2011). The cost of traffic congestion
is 10 per cent of the gross domestic product
of Lima, Peru and 3.4 per cent of the gross
domestic product of Buenos Aires, Argentina
(Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific et al., 2011). Most of this economic
loss comes from the value of the time lost by
drivers and passengers. Moreover, congestion
worsens carbon emissions and air pollution,
resulting in negative effects on health.

13

Automobile travel requires vast land for roads
and parking areas. New sprawling suburbs
have high infrastructure costs and cause the
loss of productive agricultural land as well as
the loss of urban land to asphalt. Due to their
hard surfaces, roads also make the absorption
of storm-water more difficult.
While fossil-fuel powered automobile travel is
increasingly becoming less sustainable, public
transport is also facing the challenge of lack of
interest. In particular, public transport projects
that are undertaken without sufficient public
consultation are likely to misinterpret local
demand on transit routes. At the same time,
despite its drawbacks, automobile ownership
is continuously increasing. The global private
automobile fleet is expected to grow from
1 billion in 2002 to 2 billion in 2022, mainly
driven by motorization in Asia. In Delhi, India,
it is estimated that the number of vehicles
in 2030 will be five times that of 1990 levels
(Asian Development Bank and German
Agency for International Cooperation, 2011).
Automobiles are seen as a status symbol that
ensures convenience and personal freedom
of travel and citizens are biased towards using
this mode of transport.
Science, technology and innovation for
avoiding congestion and improving
urban mobility
Mobility solutions should not only focus on
supplying infrastructure but on answering
the demand for infrastructure. They should
be centred on the movement of people and
goods instead of the movement of vehicles
and deal with the causes of mobility issues
rather than merely the symptoms. They are
thus directly linked to spatial planning, as
spatial plans dictate mobility options and
whether or not cities may be walkable.
Spatial planning that takes the needs of
urban transport into consideration from
the beginning is a key factor in helping
to prioritize public transport. Cities can
make streets more walkable for pedestrians
through the provision of dedicated lanes and
suitable street crossings and by minimizing
pedestrian bridges. In addition, bicycling
may be encouraged through the provision

14

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

of dedicated lanes and low-velocity streets.
Ultimately, mobility issues cannot be solved
only by science, technology and innovation.
Social aspects and driver education need to
be combined with technological solutions.
Cities can make use of technology to switch to
cleaner fuels in transport vehicles, implement
various public transport systems and enable
regulatory measures that control and improve
the flow of traffic. Although there are a large
variety of science, technology and innovation
solutions that can address congestion and
high levels of fuel consumption, many are not
feasible for implementation in developing
countries due to their cost. It is therefore
imperative for cities in developing countries
to integrate high and low technology to
provide mobility solutions for citizens.
Bus rapid transit has lately emerged as a popular
urban transit solution and is being introduced
across the world, including in cities of least
developed countries, with successful results in
reducing congestion, air pollution and travel
time, as shown by the examples in box 5. Bus
rapid transit is a dedicated-lane bus system
with signal priority at intersections, prepaid
fares and fast-boarding platforms. While bus
rapid transit is a relatively low-cost method
of providing public transport, it needs to be

viewed in the larger context of urban mobility,
ensuring the development of infrastructure for
bicycles and pedestrians, as well as integration
with other means of public transport.
Science, technology and innovation,
especially information and communications
technologies, enable innovative regulations
to improve mobility in growing urban
areas. Information and communications
technologies can inform citizens with regard
to mobility choices they are about to make
through algorithms that predict traffic
flow one hour ahead of time with up to
80 per cent accuracy. Providing data on the
impact of journeys to urban citizens allows
them to adjust their mobility choices. In
addition, information and communications
technologies can analyse route patterns in new
ways so that bottlenecks can be addressed
through the most efficient investments in
public transport. For example, information
and communications technologies are key to
understanding the reasons behind phantom
traffic jams, through which a small disturbance
in the flow of vehicles during heavy traffic
leads to a traffic standstill. Information and
communications technologies models are
being developed to explain the reasons for
such traffic jams so that roads can be designed
to prevent them.

Bus rapid transit in developing countries

The city of Curitiba, Brazil, pioneered public-transport oriented spatial design based on bus rapid transit, with a system
that uses dedicated lanes, allowing it to function as a low-cost subway. The system also has a special design for stops that
facilitates quick payments and easy transfers. Starting at 25,000 daily passengers in 1974, the bus rapid transit system grew
to serve 2.2 million passengers in 2007. Although the city’s population grew from 400,000 to 2 million in 50 years, it did not
suﬀer from additional pollution or congestion.
Curitiba’s system was the ﬁrst of its kind in the world and similar systems were later introduced in more than 83 cities globally. The sharing of knowledge between cities has greatly contributed to the increase in the number of such systems. For
example, a presentation in 2004 by the mayor of Bogota, Colombia, describing the success of the bus rapid transit system
in the city motivated the conceptualization of a similar project in Ahmedabad, India.
Since its launch in 2009, the system in Ahmedabad has been expanded to cover a distance of 67 kilometres, with 136 buses
transporting 130,000 passengers per day. An additional 21 kilometres is expected to be completed by 2015 in phase two of the
project and a further 27 kilometres is planned for phase three. The system in Ahmedabad is India’s most extensive and successful bus rapid transit system. It gives priority to buses at junctions and uses segregated lanes, level passenger boarding, external
ticketing and real-time arrivals information to reduce traveling times and ensure better service compared with conventional
bus services. As a result of factors such as higher eﬃciency and increased ridership, it is estimated to have increased the travel
speeds of buses by 20 to 60 per cent and achieved carbon dioxide emissions savings of 92,000 tons in 2010.

Information and communications technologies tools for mobility

The city of Dublin, Ireland, is cooperating with International Business Machines to identify and solve the root causes of trafﬁc congestion along its public bus network. Information-sharing between partnering local governments and universities
is resulting in the use of 3,000 data sets to identify new ways for Dublin’s transport, energy and water systems to work in
an integrated manner. Such data is also being made available to the local community, which is encouraging the development of innovative information and communications technologies tools. Data from a citywide network of sensors is being
integrated with geospatial data so that city oﬃcials can monitor and manage the bus ﬂeet in real time.
The same business model is being piloted in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, where the analysis of global positioning system data
to understand mobility patterns has helped identify four new bus routes and optimize several others. As a result, citywide
travel time has decreased by 10 per cent and there is less need for informal bus services.
Singapore is using geospatial data and information collected from transport tickets to plan future transport services and recommend routes and to provide additional services such as the location of taxicabs during rain. Singapore also uses mobile
telephone data to map current traﬃc situations and propose alternate travel routes to drivers, in order to reduce congestion.
In cooperation with the World Bank, the non-proﬁt organization OpenPlans has developed a real-time traﬃc crowdsourcing application for Cebu City, the Philippines. Once deployed, the application will collect real-time traﬃc data from 500
telephones deployed in taxicabs. This data will provide citizens with up-to-date information about traﬃc conditions and the
historical archive will help inform planners and transport engineers.
Sources: Robinson, 2012; OpenPlans, 2012; and Worldwatch Institute, 2012.

There are various applications for information
and communications technologies, such as
traffic management systems, open access
and multimodal trip planning services.
Several cities including New York City and San
Francisco in the United States and London,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, are providing open access to core
city data and enabling the development of
applications that help citizens make more
informed travel decisions, such as finding
the closest bicycle-share or car-share station
(Worldwatch Institute, 2012). Information
and communications technologies may also
be used by citizens to plan a door-to-door
journey by integrating walking and different
modes of public transport such as bicycles,
buses, trains and automobile-sharing. If
citizens are informed that it is less economical
for them to drive, for example via applications
they can access from their mobile telephones,
they will be more inclined to use public
transport. Online commercial tools that
provide multimodal routing services, such as
Open Trip Planner (www.opentripplanner.org)
and Moovel (www.moovel.com), are already
available in the United States. Finally, as
shown in the examples in box 6, information
and communications technologies-related
tools that combine geospatial mapping with
crowdsourced data from mobile telephones

or transport tickets can play a role in relieving
traﬃc and optimizing transport eﬃciency.
Policy considerations
Avoid, shift, improve
Mobility in cities can be improved through
the combination of three strategies, namely
avoid, shift and improve, which can transform
behaviour and influence technology choices
(Asian Development Bank and German
Agency for International Cooperation, 2011
and United Nations Environment Programme,
2011). The avoid strategy is for reducing
journeys and avoiding the need to travel. Shift
represents a move to more environmentally
friendly modes of transport. Improve refers
to the improvement of energy efficiency in
the transport vehicles used. The avoid–shift–
improve model is based on a combination
of incentives and disincentives and the use
of technology. For example, regulators can
aim to overcome automobile dependence
through a combination of measures such as
the following (Wheeler, 2008):
•

Traffic-calming techniques to slow
automobile traffic and create more humane
urban environments better suited to other
transportation modes.

Intermodal transport planning

In developing countries, intermodal transport services are contributing to social inclusion. Several cities in Latin America –
including La Paz, the Plurinational State of Bolivia; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Medellín, Colombia – are implementing cable
car and escalator projects to integrate poorer outskirts, located on steep landscapes, with city centres. The cable car, also
known as a gondola lift, is a transport system that travels up and down a mountainside in which cabins are suspended on
a continuously moving cable driven by a motor at one end of the route. Cable cars dramatically reduce daily commutes for
citizens living in areas that are diﬃcult and costly to access with traditional public transport services.
Free cable cars and escalators were installed in Medellín in order to provide access to the city centre from the most isolated
neighbourhoods. Before, inhabitants in these neighbourhoods had to commute 2.5 hours to reach the city centre. The
cable cars now provide access to more than half a million citizens. In addition, a network of escalators has reduced the time
needed to access one of the poorest sections of the city by half an hour.

•

Improved transit, such as by prioritizing
walking and bicycling as genuine options to
automobile use.

•

Improved land use, for example by
establishing urban villages that are selfsufficient in terms of employment and
recreational activities and thereby reduce
the need to travel by automobile.

•

Growth management to prevent sprawl and
redirect development into urban villages.

•

Economic incentives, such as better taxation
of transportation.

Traffic-calming techniques include altering road
layout and design such as by narrowing entries
to streets, planting trees and employing variable
street surfaces, speed-restricting devices and
visual signs for cautious driving. On busier roads,
traffic calming may be achieved by reclaiming
road space for other uses and reducing the
speed of traffic. Traffic-calming measures can
reduce congestion, thereby saving fuel wasted
in traffic jams and preventing the loss of time.
Intermodal transport
Traffic calming should be implemented in
coordination with schemes that make public
transport more attractive in the same areas by
combining land use and intermodal transport
strategies. Cities can reclaim road space in
parallel to improving intermodal public transport
networks such as rail links. Modern light-rail
systems that accompany pedestrian zones in
city centres reduce the need for automobiles.
Intermodal transport networks include mass

rapid-transit systems surrounded by highdensity land-use developments. Science,
technology and innovation can help in the
process of planning the integration of modes
of transport such as walking, public transport,
bicycles, taxicabs and automobiles, for example
through park-and-ride systems. A transitoriented development approach concentrates
residential and commercial developments
within walking distance of public transport
stations to maximize the number of passengers.
Intermodal transport services can contribute
to social inclusion by combining a wide variety
of science, technology and innovation-related
solutions, as shown by the examples in box 7.
Regulatory mechanisms and incentives
Cities can accompany public transport
infrastructure investments with innovative
regulatory mechanisms and incentives.
Optimizing urban mobility entails achieving
the best balance between different modes
of transportation (Vuchic, 2008). Regulations
such as incentives for public transport use
and disincentives for automobile use can be
introduced in order to reach a compromise
between personal freedom to choose transport
modes, social optimum modes that minimize
travel costs and the time for travellers in the
urban area and environmental concerns such
as the need to reduce air pollution. Measures
can include both soft incentives and hard
regulation (Banister, 2008 and Vuchic, 2008).
Traffic demand management regulation
more suited to higher-income countries
includes low-emission zones in city centres

17

III. Sustainable urban planning

and increased fuel taxes, road pricing and
parking-zone charges. Road pricing may be
a solution for traffic calming in larger cities,
as shown in box 8, but the investment in the
technical infrastructure necessary to operate
it, such as cameras that take photographs of
license plates, road signalling and sensors that
automatically deduct tolls from units inside
vehicles, may not be worthwhile in smaller
cities as the scheme may not raise enough
funds to cover operational infrastructure costs.
Political acceptance by the public may be a
more significant issue and road pricing also
requires privacy and data protection measures.
Possible measures and incentives vary across
countries and include traffic calming, the
promotion of walking, bicycling and automobilesharing programmes and the reallocation of
open space to public transport. One important
element of success for such schemes is to gather
public support by engaging stakeholders and
communicating and sharing information.
Box 8.

When launching bicycling incentives such as
electric-bicycle promotion campaigns, it is just
as important to establish a legal framework
on the status of such vehicles within city
traffic as it is to make the vehicles available
and establish the physical infrastructure. For
example, bicycle-sharing programmes, already
available in around 200 cities worldwide, require
infrastructure such as parking spaces and tracks
and a legal framework that protects the rights of
cyclists. Otherwise, users may not feel safe when
bicycling in the city.

Singapore was one of the ﬁrst cities to apply physical, regulatory and pricing measures to coordinate the use of diﬀerent
modes in a balanced intermodal transport system. The city pioneered road pricing in the city centre to reduce congestion. In
parallel, it built a state-of-the art subway system and optimized its bus system with many transfer points and major terminals
at subway stations. The Land Transport Authority comprehensively plans and coordinates all modes of mobility in Singapore.
London has also implemented congestion pricing in the city centre. While the scheme faced resistance at the beginning, it
gained more public acceptance after reducing traﬃc levels by 15 to 20 per cent and congestion by over 20 per cent in the
ﬁrst three years of operation. Milan, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden have also implemented similar measures in their city centres.
Regulation and programmes that encourage walking and bicycling
London has recently introduced a rewards system through which users can accumulate points as they walk or bicycle and
redeem them to obtain diﬀerent kinds of services such as haircuts and shopping. A mobile telephone application uses the
telephone’s global positioning system signal to track movement (see www.recyclebank.com). In Switzerland, a bicycle-towork initiative encourages participants to commute up to 50 per cent of the time by bicycling and gain the chance to win
prizes such as holiday weekends.
Combination of measures
Cheonggyecheon, a river running through downtown Seoul, was used as a sewer in the 1950s and then covered by an elevated motorway in the 1970s. The motorway became very congested in the 1980s and at the same time created an urban
fault line hampering the livelihood of the middle of the city. In 2003, the metropolitan government removed the motorway,
restored the river and turned the area into a tourist attraction, creating 300,000 jobs and also providing environmental beneﬁts. The project was accompanied by improvements to the city’s public transportation system, which was made possible
through a consensus-based decision-making model that promoted intermodal transit, incorporating dedicated bus lanes
and a uniﬁed fare system. The key to success was the formation of a consultative group, the Citizens Collaborative Council,
which ensured that no party would be disadvantaged by the proposed transport solutions.

hazards. The effects of climate change are
exacerbating the issue by instigating more
frequent urban climate-related hazards. On
the one hand, more and more people are
moving into vibrant metropolises that are
situated on or close to the coast. On the
other hand, such cities are increasingly at
risk due to climate-change induced natural
disasters, especially informal settlements
on city fringes and lower-quality buildings
that are the products of rapid unplanned
urbanization and represent a resilience
issue for developing countries, although
they play an important role in terms of
meeting the shelter needs of the urban
poor. Low construction standards and poor
drainage result in serious vulnerability to
natural risks.
Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in the
United States in October 2012, only one year
after Hurricane Irene, served as a reminder
of the dangers that cities face. New York City
is one of several global cities at risk due to
the fact that it is surrounded by water, and
the precautions such cities can take against
risks such as rising sea levels are limited.
In developing countries, urban areas with
large populations situated along coastlines
and exposed to climate-related hazards
include Guangzhou and Shanghai in China,
Alexandria in Egypt, Kolkata and Mumbai in
India and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam.
In the past 20 years, floods have become the
most frequent natural disaster. The average
annual number of floods has increased at
a higher rate than any other natural hazard
(Green Media, 2012). The most important
hazards that will become more frequent
and affect urban zones due to increased
climate variability include rising sea levels,
storm surges, extreme rain, heat waves and
the heat-island effect, water scarcity and air
pollution.
City managements in lower and middleincome countries face challenges in
developing and maintaining disaster risk
management strategies. They lack an
understanding of risk and methodologies
to assess risk, particularly with regard
to urban growth areas and informal

settlements. Disaster and climate-change
risk is not a priority due to the lack of
financial resources and institutional
capacity. Finally, few have procedures to
mainstream disaster risk management
and climate change adaptation into urban
planning or monitoring of a city’s risk
reduction performance (Thapa et al., 2010
and Dickson et al., 2012).
Science, technology and innovation
for monitoring and managing natural
hazards
A resilient city is one that can predict and
react to natural disasters in order to minimize
the loss of lives and disruption to city utilities
and services. The use of technology plays an
important role in improving city resilience
against natural hazards. Several cities in
developing countries are already using
science, technology and innovation for this
purpose in various forms and combinations.
The most common applications are hazard
monitoring and surveillance, information
and communications technology-based
city operations centres, geospatial tools and
large-scale infrastructure such as storm-water
tunnels and barriers.
Some of the benefits of designing cities that
are compact and dense were noted in chapter
III. a. Higher density also requires stronger
infrastructure that is resilient to natural
disasters. Otherwise, increasing density will
only exacerbate the exposure of cities to such
risks. Science, technology and innovation
play a key role in informing urban planners of
where to build cities to prevent risks brought
about by climate change or proximity to a
coast.
Hazard
monitoring
and
surveillance
techniques can be beneficial for early
warning and land-use planning. For example,
Mumbai has 35 automatic weather stations
that measure real-time rainfall intensity and
flow gauges on the Mithi River to monitor
water flow. Chacao, a subdivision of Caracas,
has a wireless early-warning system that
connects civil protection and environmental
institutions with cameras that monitor four

19

river channels crossing the city. The city also
provides online real-time hazard information
to citizens (United Nations Office for Disaster
Risk Reduction, 2012).
Information and communications technologies that combine data from different departments can enable cities to monitor risks in an
integrated manner. Rio de Janeiro established
an operations centre by partnering with International Business Machines that provides
real-time integrated data from 30 agencies on
transport, energy, weather and emergency
services. The centre has improved reaction
times and coordination between agencies.
For example, when a 20-storey building collapsed in January 2012, the centre employees
alerted the fire and civil defence departments,
asked the gas and electric companies to shut
down service in the area, closed the subway
stop, blocked the street, dispatched ambulances, alerted hospitals, sent equipment to
clear the rubble and deployed civil guards to
secure the site. The centre also kept citizens
informed over the Internet via Twitter (Singer,
2012).
Information and communications technologies in the form of geospatial tools may be
beneficial for assessing disaster risk and disaster recovery. For example, such tools were
used by the International Organization for Migration in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake to identify appropriate buildings and
sites that could be used as shelters (UNCTAD,
2012b).
Box 9.

In Malaysia, a multi-use tunnel was
constructed for storm-water management
and road traffic in Kuala Lumpur in response
to a serious problem of flooding and a need
to divert large quantities of water from the
city. The high-technology tunnel has two
layers that can be used in three modes
depending on the intensity of water flow, as
shown in box 9. In the first mode, the tunnel
is used for road traffic on an everyday basis. In
the second mode, when there is a moderate
storm, one layer is used for road traffic, while
the other layer diverts storm-water. In the
third mode, in the event of heavy flooding,
the tunnel is closed to traffic and both layers
are used to divert water to holding reservoirs.
In some cities, lower-technology solutions
such as insulating subway entrances to
prevent storm-water from flowing in may
also be useful in improving resilience.
Policy considerations
Cities need to invest proactively in
infrastructure in order to adapt to natural
hazards. As oceans grow warmer and sea
levels rise due to the effects of climate
change, cities will have to continuously
revise their risk assessments and adapt their
infrastructure. Many of the policies mentioned
in previous sections can help increase resilience.
For example, improved buildings can reduce
human losses and spatial plans can take into
account the risk of natural disasters. In addition to
the necessity to save lives when disasters occur,

20

adaptation has a financial dimension. Investing
into adaptation earlier can reduce the scale of
economic losses and the financing required to
repair damage. Considering that the economic
damage that New York City suffered due to
Hurricane Sandy is estimated at $20 billion, the
human and economic costs of inaction in lessprepared cities in developing countries can be
enormous. The cost of repairing damage from
climate change-related flooding is estimated
at 2 to 6 per cent of regional gross domestic
product in Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and
Manila, the Philippines (UN-Habitat, 2012c).
Cities can mainstream adaptation into urban
planning. Possible measures include building
new developments outside of risk areas,
upgrading informal settlements and addressing
the lack of infrastructure and the degradation of
the environment (UN-Habitat, 2012c).
Box 10.

Mainstreaming adaptation into
urban planning and
urban risk assessments

The eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa,
integrated adaptation planning into its general urban
planning and development framework, including adaptation at both municipal and community levels. In
2006, a climate change-related impact assessment was
prepared, following which a climate change adaptation
strategy was put together to identify key interventions
for such situations as an urban heat-island eﬀect or a rise
in sea level. The strategy is constantly being extended, to
include reforestation projects and water, health and disaster management. An assessment tool was also developed to evaluate and compare policies and mainstreaming initiatives were undertaken, such as the creation of a
climate protection branch within the municipality.
Sorsogon City, the Philippines, is a city with 152,000 inhabitants that is open to the Paciﬁc Ocean to both the
east and west. The city faces an average of ﬁve tropical
storms each year. In cooperation with UN-Habitat, the
city conducted a vulnerability and adaptation assessment, as a result of which it directed urban development plans to safer inland areas. Settlements in high-risk
coastal zones will be incrementally relocated through local shelter relocation projects or voluntary resettlement.
Inland areas will be incentivized through infrastructure
investments and the construction of new residential
units and new industrial sites for employment.
Sources: United Nations Environment Programme,
2012b; and UN-Habitat, 2012c.

Integrating spatial planning with infrastructure can also improve resilience. Risk assessments are tools that can mainstream
resilience and preparedness into spatial
planning. The tools map the areas that are
most vulnerable to hazards and help adjust
land use and development strategies. Some
cities or city areas are more vulnerable than
others and risk assessments make it possible to demarcate and provide extra safety
for these areas. Regulatory measures based
on risk assessments can help city planners
forecast and guard against future developments to avoid the risk of disaster.
For example, Dhaka, Bangladesh, accompanied infrastructure measures such as
reinforcing river and canal embankments
with efforts to prevent the encroachment
of buildings on the vicinity of canals for
improved protection against major floods.
Similarly, regulatory measures based on
risk assessments can guide future developments to avoid disaster risk. For example,
Singapore requires new land reclamations
to be at least 2.25 metres above the highest
level of recorded tides (UN-Habitat, 2012c).
The United Nations Environment Programme, UN-Habitat and the World Bank,
with the support of Cities Alliance, a global
partnership for urban poverty reduction
and the promotion of the role of cities in
sustainable development, have developed
a standardized risk assessment tool to assess urban risk and identify areas and populations that are most vulnerable, typically
those living in informal settlements. The
tool provides a framework for both qualitative and quantitative assessments that
enhance a local government’s capacity to
identify hazards that may arise from disaster and climate change-related risks. The
tool assesses the exposure and vulnerability
of specific assets and populations, analyses
institutional capacities and data availability
and quantifies city vulnerabilities through
the application of a baseline-benchmarking
approach to assess progress over time and
space (UN-Habitat, 2012c). box 10 provides
examples of the use of urban risk assessments to improve disaster resilience.

IV. Sustainable urban resource management

IV. Sustainable urban resource management
Energy, water and food consumption in
urban areas in developing countries is rapidly
rising in parallel with growing incomes,
putting pressure on limited resources. At
the same time, higher consumption leads to
higher amounts of waste. Long-term urban
sustainability depends on technologies
that conserve resources and minimize
waste. Fortunately, science, technology and
innovation options are abundant to respond
to the needs of cities, and this chapter looks
at ways in which they can help improve
resource management in an urban setting.
Applications include replacing public
urban infrastructure with more efficient
options such as lighting with light-emitting
diodes, tracking public and private resource
consumption and detecting resource
leakages and theft, as well as the smart
management of resources.

IV. a. Energy for cities
Heavy energy consumption in cities
Cities are major consumers of energy and
therefore vulnerable to energy scarcity and
energy price increases. Adequate energy
supply to growing urban zones is increasingly
becoming a challenge. It is largely expected
that in cities of emerging countries, demand
will continue to exceed capacity in the coming
years. This raises questions on how to improve
energy efficiency, regulate the electricity
market, involve the private sector and revise
the mechanism of subsidized energy pricing,
among others (GlobeScan and McCormick
Rankin Corporation McLean Hazel, 2007).

Large centralized energy production facilities
require costly distribution systems that are
vulnerable to misuse and natural disasters.
In rapid-growth urban environments, lowdensity sprawl leads to a rapid increase in
per capita distribution and line-maintenance
costs. In many countries, distribution lines
are also subject to siphoning. Moreover,
centralized energy production follows a
supply-driven approach, prioritizing selling
energy over saving energy, creating no
incentives for energy-efficiency practices
that can reduce consumption. With rapid
urbanization, providing access to electricity
in a centralized manner for growing cities will
grow more challenging.
Science, technology and innovation for
urban energy conservation
Various clean low-carbon energy technologies
compatible with use in cities are available to
improve energy efficiency and enable the
transition to renewable energy sources in
cities. Table 3 gives examples of innovative
energy technologies that may be considered
for densely populated urban areas (UNHabitat, 2012b). Each technology has marketrelated, technical, institutional, political, social
and environmental challenges on the way to
mainstream use. Cost competitiveness with
fossil-fuel energy sources is a major issue.
The technical limitations of clean energy
technologies such as the battery efficiency of
solar photovoltaic technology and issues such
as the lack of infrastructure or trained workers
and the lack of public acceptance also need
to be overcome (Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, 2012).

Micro hydropower systems can complement intermittent wind or solar

from walking

Purpose-made slabs installed on pavements can harvest renewable
energy from footsteps. The technology, developed by Pavegen, converts
kinetic energy to electricity that can be stored and used for powering offgrid applications such as pedestrian lighting, wayfinding solutions and
advertising signage (see www.pavegen.com).

Heating

District
heating

District heating systems can distribute heat and power from a centralized
location. The heat often comes from combined heat and power plants
and can therefore achieve higher efficiencies and lower emissions than
separated heat and power production.

Electric grids

Smart grids

Smart grids are intelligent electric systems that have the following
three major components: demand management; distributed energy
generation; and transmission and distribution grid management.

Vehicle-togrid

Once the number of electric vehicles in urban traffic reaches a critical mass,
it will be possible to benefit from bidirectional connections between the
batteries of such vehicles and smart electricity grids. At peak times for the
grid, if a vehicle is not in use, it can feed energy from its battery back into
the grid.

Lighting

Lightemitting
diodes

Partnerships between information and communications technologies
networking and lighting companies are making smart, networked
information and communications technologies-based lighting with
light-emitting diodes possible. Light-emitting diode technologies can
generate relatively effortless and immediate savings in electricity.

Information and
communications
technologies

Carbonfootprint
applications

Information and communications technologies-related applications
can help encourage more sustainable energy consumption patterns
by individuals, for example by proactively tracking and distributing
information on personal carbon footprints and consumption patterns.

UN-Habitat, 2012b; and Villa and Mitchell, 2010.

Information and communications technologies play a critical role in many of the options
listed in table 3. They enable the automated,
or smart, management of electricity generation and distribution, leading to lower consumption and reductions in carbon emissions
(Souter and MacLean, 2012). The large-scale
use of information and communications technologies for energy management in urban areas in the medium to long term will have a
profound impact on consumption patterns.

The possibility for households to be informed
of patterns of consumption and to compare
them is likely to induce behaviour that conserves energy.
Policy considerations
Although energy policy is a national issue,
cities in developing countries can lead the
way in leapfrogging to advanced renewable
energy sources and efficient transmission

Regulatory support for renewable energy

The Government of India formulated a solar cities programme in order to reduce demand for fossil-fuel energy sources
by at least 10 per cent in sixty cities between 2007 and 2012. The programme allocates ﬁnancial assistance to local
governments that show commitment to implementing renewable energy projects through master plans, governance
structures and project proposals.
The authorities of the city of Rizhao, China, provided strong political and ﬁnancial support for the development of a local
solar panel industry. As a result, solar technology became widespread, with 99 per cent of Rizhao’s households in the
central districts using solar water heaters and almost all traﬃc signals, street lights and park illuminations powered by solar energy. In addition, solar cooking facilities are common in households and solar panels are used to heat greenhouses,
reducing overhead costs for farmers.
Shanghai envisages a total of 13 wind farms with an installed capacity of 2.1 gigawatts by 2020, which will provide electricity to more than 4 million households. The plan includes China’s ﬁrst oﬀshore wind farm, which is also the world’s ﬁrst
major wind farm outside of Europe. It will provide around 1 per cent of the city’s total power production.
In several cities across Eastern Europe that had older district heating infrastructure, modernization eﬀorts driven by European Union directives as well as national energy programmes are taking place that could generate 15 to 30 per cent
savings in heating energy. Since district heating can use renewable energy sources such as biomass, geothermal and
solar energy with biomass, it harbours great potential for countries that already have infrastructure for this technology
in place.

technologies through local regulations,
incentives or subsidies, as shown in the
examples in box 11. Cities can pioneer the
transition to renewable energy by making
use of national incentives as well.
The use of new technologies in cities can
reduce the burden of rapidly increasing
energy demand, as shown in the examples
in box 12. For instance, implementing smart
grids increases the flexibility of energy
production and distribution by making
it possible for decentralized individual
energy producers, for example households
with solar panels on their roofs, to feed
surplus energy back into the electricity
grid (Cosgrave, 2012). Smart grids provide
real-time information to utility companies
with the help of sensors, enabling them
to respond to changes in power supply,
demand, costs and emissions and to
prevent major power outages. Smart
grids can drive cross-sectoral cooperation,
enable decentralized energy generation
and encourage more efficient energy
consumption patterns.
Smart grid investment should be prioritized
in large cities that face frequent peaks in
electricity demand and also have a high

potential for decentralized generation
capacity, such as suitable weather
conditions for installing solar panels on
buildings. Local governments can establish
regulatory frameworks for local energy
marketplaces that make use of smart-grid
technology. These marketplaces would
make it possible for individuals to trade
excess power generated by their private
facilities, such as micro wind turbines
or solar energy panels located in homes
(Robinson, 2012). The deployment of
smart grids could generate up to $4 trillion
worth of savings until 2050 in Europe,
mainly due to the reduced need to invest
in new electricity generation capacity
(Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, 2012).
Off-grid energy production based on
renewable sources can also reduce
the need to invest in new centralized
production and distribution systems. Cities
can provide incentives to companies that
specialize in off-grid solutions. Finally,
designing integrated energy and waste
management infrastructure can optimize
energy efficiency and generate significant
savings.

Technologies for energy generation and conservation in practice

Information and communications technologies tools for optimizing energy management
The following cities are partnering with Cisco to provide integrated city data for use in improving traﬃc, public transportation, energy eﬃciency and the self-management of carbon footprints by residents: Hamburg, Germany; Amsterdam, the
Netherlands; Lisbon, Portugal; Seoul; Madrid, Spain; Birmingham, United Kingdom; and San Francisco.
Kinetic energy
Purpose-made slabs installed on pavements can convert kinetic energy from footsteps to electricity. The technology,
developed by Pavegen, is best suited to high-footfall urban environments and represents a good example of how
clean technologies can also be enjoyable, which is an important aspect for general public awareness and adoption.
The technology was installed in 2012 at a subway station in London near the Olympics facilities.
Oﬀ-grid energy generation
Sunlabob, a company in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, started operations by providing solar electriﬁcation to
homes on a rental basis. It established an innovative public–private partnership business model whereby local public
authorities covered part of the investment cost through ownership of solar lamps that were rented out to households,
while Sunlabob owned the charging stations. The company created a national network of franchises and provided training
on marketing, installation and maintenance. Following its initial success, Sunlabob diversiﬁed to oﬀer a full range of renewable energy solutions, such as solar water pumps and heaters, water puriﬁcation systems, street lighting solutions, cooling
units for health posts and solar lanterns.
Another oﬀ-grid solution provider is M-Kopa, a start-up in Kenya that has designed a solar lamp consisting of a base station
with a solar panel, three lamps and a charging kit for use with telephones. Users can pay for part of the system upfront and
the rest via minimal instalments that they transfer by using mobile telephones. The lamps can replace kerosene lamps that
are not only expensive but also dangerous to health.
Integrated energy and waste management
The Hammarby Sjöstad district of Stockholm is an ecological district that has used brownfield industry space for
development, referred to as the Hammarby Model in urban planning. The district minimizes energy use while optimizing water use and waste management with the help of recycling, energy and waste treatment plants. Buildings
send waste and wastewater to combined heat and power plants and wastewater treatment plants that then produce
heating, biogas and electricity for the buildings. The district plans to produce 50 per cent of its energy requirements
locally.

IV. b. Solid waste management
Exponential growth in urban waste
Uncontrolled solid waste is growing faster
than urbanization and represents a serious
issue for the sustainability of cities. Growing
cities generate higher amounts of waste per
inhabitant. Rates of solid waste growth are
fastest in China, other countries in East Asia,
parts of Eastern Europe and the Middle East
(Hoornweg and Perinaz, 2012). The amount of
solid waste generated in rapidly growing cities
in developing countries is a serious health risk
for their populations. Using landfills reduces

the attractiveness of cities. Landfills do not
decompose easily, and produce methane,
which heavily contributes to greenhouse
gas emissions. The incineration of solid
waste is also not preferable as it can cause air
pollution. Although waste is an energy source
that could be reused, it is not seen as such in
many countries.
The cost of solid waste management can
be very high, reaching up to half of the total
municipal budget of medium-sized cities in
lower-income countries. Global solid waste
generation is due to increase from 1.3 billion
tons per year to 2.2 billion tons by 2025. It is
an urgent priority, especially in lower-income

25

Box 13.

Integrated solid waste management in practice

In Kalundborg, Denmark, companies located in an industrial zone started selling waste products as raw materials to each
other in 1961. The network later grew to include more than 30 exchange pipes. Surplus heat, steam and other residue
generated from a 1,500 megawatt coal-ﬁred power plant are all reutilized by nearby businesses, reducing the ecological
footprint of the plant and involved companies.
São Paulo implemented a landﬁll emissions control programme that renovated two solid waste landﬁlls. Methane-rich
biogas from decaying waste was used to generate electric power on site. The programme both reduced the amount of
methane released into the atmosphere and supplied energy to 7 per cent of households in São Paulo. The programme
was approved as a Clean Development Mechanism project of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. In 2008, the programme was generating a number of carbon credits that was close to the sum of all other
certiﬁed projects in Brazil. The city used the proceeds of these credits to fund urban and environmental improvement
projects in surrounding areas.

countries, where serious increases in solid
waste management costs are expected
(Hoornweg and Perinaz, 2012).
Science, technology and innovation for
waste management
Integrated solid waste management is a
waste management approach that refers to
a shift from less-preferred waste treatment
and disposal methods such as incineration
and different forms of landfilling towards the
reduce, reuse and recycle, or three Rs, model,
as shown in the examples in box 13.
Activities under integrated solid waste
management can include the following:
• Resource conservation, which
excessive resource consumption.

avoids

• Waste reduction through resource-use
optimization.
• Waste collection and segregation, ensuring
appropriate waste treatment.
• Waste reuse, which circulates waste and
avoids the use of new resources.
• Waste recycling, which converts waste into
useful products.
• Energy recovery, which harnesses residual
energy from waste. For example, waste
and wastewater can be used for producing
biogas, synthetic gas and synthetic
construction materials.

• Landfill avoidance, which conserves land
and avoids the risks of contamination.
• Construction and maintenance of
infrastructure for waste collection, recovery
of materials from waste streams through
collection, segregation and the application
of technologies related to the three Rs and
associated activities.
The long-term vision under integrated solid
waste management is to establish a circular
economy in which the use of materials and
the generation of waste are minimized,
any unavoidable waste is recycled or
remanufactured and any remaining waste is
treated in a way that causes the least damage
to health and the environment or even creates
value by recovering energy (Totty, 2011 and
United Nations Environment Programme,
2011).
Policy considerations
Following the Hammarby Sjöstad and
Kalundborg examples, cities can make use
of technologies to convert certain types of
waste into energy. Many Governments in
Europe are promoting ecological industrial
parks, also referred to as industrial symbiosis
systems. Emerging economy cities are
also implementing projects based on
integrated solid waste management and
the three Rs.

26

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Public–private partnerships, as well as
joint initiatives of local communities and
non-governmental organizations, can be
effective in launching waste management
initiatives. In several countries, public–
private partnerships between municipalities
and the private sector, as well as organized
initiatives by citizens, are already actively
participating in solid waste management,
as shown by the examples in box 14.
Managing solid waste in combination with
spatial planning can help optimize energy
consumption and reduce waste in cities (UNHabitat, 2012c). For example, the location of
landfills can minimize negative effects and
providing sorting and recycling space close to
locations where waste is generated can help
reduce the size of disposal sites.

IV. c. Resource-efficient
buildings
High energy consumption in buildings
The built environment poses a challenge
for resource efficiency. Buildings account for
40 per cent of global energy use, 38 per cent
of global greenhouse gas emissions, 12 per
cent of global potable water use and 40 per

Box 14.

cent of solid waste streams in developed
countries (United Nations Environment
Programme, 2012a). The lack of resource
efficiency measures for existing or new
buildings results in a missed opportunity and
carries the resource burden, environmental
damage and social inequality into the
future. Since new buildings are long-term
investments and the housing stock of cities is
gradually replaced, policies requiring resource
efficiency standards can combine affordability
with sustainability in the long term.
Especially in cities in developing countries,
the built environment is a cause of concern
in terms of current and forthcoming
housing shortages. There is high demand
for affordable housing in the cities of rapidly
urbanizing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
America and a lack of space for newcomers.
In China, it is estimated that as much new
building floor space will be built until 2030
as the entire existing building stock of the
United States (UN-Habitat, 2012a). Due to the
fact that the supply of affordable housing,
infrastructure and services is not able to
catch up with the rate of urbanization in
developing countries, informal shelters are
built with no infrastructure, little sanitation
and no compliance with planning or building
regulations.

Public–private partnerships and community initiatives for solid waste management

In developing countries, public–private partnerships and innovative community initiatives are contributing to the management of urban waste.
For example, in 1998 in Dhaka, a city of 12 million inhabitants where the municipality cannot process more than 30 to 40 per
cent of generated solid waste, Waste Concern, a local non-governmental organization, launched a public–private partnership for waste collection with logistical support and programme coordination by public authorities. Local communities collected waste that complied with the minimum quality benchmarks of Waste Concern and sold it to private fertilizer companies. The initiative reduced greenhouse gas emissions, saved landﬁll area in the city and provided employment for women.
The public–private partnership model of Waste Concern was replicated in several other cities and towns in Bangladesh, servicing a total population of 130,000 in 15 cities. The collection of waste helped avoid the production of methane gas that is
released when organic waste is deposited at a landﬁll. The project was registered with the Clean Development Mechanism.
The Waste Concern model was extended to three composting models and four ﬁnancial models, following which it was applied in other countries. The city of Matale in Sri Lanka established an integrated centre to treat organic waste and produce

IV. Sustainable urban resource management

Science, technology and innovation for
resource-efficient buildings
Resource-consuming buildings harbour the
greatest potential for resource and emissions
reductions. Sustainable houses can be built by
using a range of techniques and practices that
improve resource efficiency and contribute
to healthy indoor living conditions at a
reasonable cost. Solutions differ according to
the type of house, the climate zone and the
available infrastructure around the building,
such as whether there is access to district
heating. Using sustainable technologies in
new buildings could achieve a 30 to 50 per
cent reduction in energy use, a 35 per cent
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,
a 40 per cent reduction in water use and
a 70 per cent reduction in waste outputs
(United Nations Environment Programme,
2012a).
The vast majority of cities evolve gradually
and retrofitting is therefore a key science,
technology and innovation-related approach
on which they need to rely. Retrofitting
existing buildings can bring about significant
efficiencies, both in terms of the building
itself and the city in general. It is cheaper
to build and retrofit in an urban zone that
already benefits from connections to utilities
and transport networks. Many cities are
implementing retrofitting programmes such
as the transformation of industrial riverfronts
or the replacement of obsolete structures, for
example in the Cheonggyecheon project in
Seoul, as noted in box 8. Table 4 lists examples
of technology options for sustainable buildings.
Buildings can employ either passive or
active environmental design strategies.
Passive design techniques such as improved

27

insulation, natural ventilation and daylighting
take advantage of the building’s site or
climatic characteristics to improve resource
efficiency. According to energy consumption
guidelines in the United Kingdom, the
introduction of natural ventilation can
save 55 to 60 per cent of the energy used
in fully air-conditioned and glazed office
buildings (United Nations Environment
Programme, 2011). The potential use of
passive strategies is greater in tropical
regions due to the priority of blocking
heat rather than generating it efficiently
(Municipal Government of Shanghai et al.,
2011). However, active systems employ
technologies such as solar panels or energyefficient appliances to improve efficiency
(United Nations Environment Programme,
2012a). A study in the United States of more
than 5,000 commercial buildings showed
that in new buildings, employing energyefficient lighting, heating, ventilation, air
conditioning and shading can achieve a
64 per cent reduction in energy use (United
Nations Environment Programme, 2012a).
While the operational phase of a building
represents the most significant opportunity
for resource efficiency, using innovative
construction technology can also save
costs and resources, as demonstrated in the
examples in box 15. New prefabricated and
modular building techniques, making use
of local building materials and local knowhow, can optimize the resource efficiency
of construction (Kaye, 2012). Using building
materials without harmful chemicals has a
highly positive impact on the health of users.
In addition, recycling building materials
can dramatically reduce the environmental
impact of the building process.

Windows provide views and daylight, passive solar energy and natural
ventilation to buildings. Through their optimal orientation and use, windows
can provide net energy to buildings. Automated shading is essential in warmer
climates to limit heat from the sun. Natural light is beneﬁcial to productivity,
well-being and health.
Homes may be placed with large facades facing east and west, letting in
morning and evening sunlight. Offices may have large facades facing north and
south, letting in high quality daylight, with shielding from direct sunlight to
avoid overheating.
Adding plants to rooftops, walls and balconies offers many beneﬁts, as follows:
added insulation; reduced runoff of water during heavy rain; aesthetic qualities;
noise reduction; and a reduced heat-island effect.
Photovoltaic cells can deliver clean energy to a building on site, eliminating
transmission losses. Combined with a heat pump, solar power can also generate
heating. The falling prices of photovoltaic cells have rendered their use more
feasible in many parts of the world.
Solar window blinds keep buildings cool by blocking sunlight and at the same
time produce electricity via photovoltaic technology.
Similar to solar panels, solar shingles are based on photovoltaic technology.
However, shingles can absorb more light and their durability makes it possible to
use them as roofing material.
Generating energy from wind by placing turbines on top of commercial or
residential buildings can cover a large percentage of the structure’s energy
needs.
Solar heating systems can provide heat and hot water and can be combined
with heat pumps to create heat depots in hot periods for use in cooler weather.
Insulation materials, from mineral wool to aerogel, are essential in every climate
for keeping heat either in or out of a building.
Techniques which use natural convection currents within air flow to direct air
into and out of buildings in order to replace rising warm air with cooler air can
function with minimal or no mechanical parts or energy consumption. For
example, air ducts can be designed to allow air to enter low in the building via
underground ducts, while simultaneously allowing air to escape from higher up
the building, and provide for natural ventilation.
Earth-to-water or air-to-water heat pumps can draw thermal energy from the
surroundings into buildings, multiplying the energy used, whereby 1 kilowatthour of electricity can deliver 2 to 4 kilowatt-hours of heat.
Ambiators can cool interiors by using thermodynamic technology based
on evaporation at a fraction of the energy consumption of conventional air
conditioning. Ambiators process air through a pump that recuperates heat and
reduces temperature. The pre-cooled air then passes through an evaporative
cooling module that uses limited amounts of water to cool the air further
(see www.hmx.co.in). Ambiators are more suitable for low-humidity locations.
Reusing water from washbasins or showers for water closets can reduce water
consumption.
Rainwater can be held in fascines or tanks, reducing runoff during heavy rain.
The water can then be reused in water closets.
Reducing the amount of ground covered by buildings, pavements, roads,
parking lots, etc. reduces both the local heat-island effect and pressure on
sewage and drainage, as the earth can absorb more water during heavy rain.
Monitoring and controlling energy demand in buildings can reduce energy
consumption by 5 to 10 per cent.

Innovative construction technologies in practice

In Harare, Zimbabwe, the Eastgate shopping centre and oﬃce block was designed and built with an innovative passive
cooling system that stores heat in daytime. The warm air rises in the evening, replaced by denser cool air low in the building.
The shopping centre has avoided the need for artiﬁcial air conditioning and saved $3.5 million.
Broad Sustainable Building, a company in China, uses pre-manufactured structures for more sustainable building construction. This technique was implemented in the construction of the Tower Hotel in Yueyang. The building has several features,
such as resilience to earthquakes of up to 9.0 on the Richter scale, thermal insulation and the ability to produce biogas from
sewage and use hot wastewater for heating purposes. Broad Sustainable Building produced 93 per cent of the building
parts in its factory and then shipped them to the construction site, where the building was assembled in only 15 days by
bolting the pre-constructed modules together. The construction process required no water, welding or scaﬀolding, caused
minimal dust and created only 1 per cent of the waste that is common in similar construction sites.
In Cuba, which has a programme for low energy and material consumption for housing, more than ﬁfty thousand homes
have been built in the last 20 years by using alternative building techniques with ecological materials that use recycled
waste products and special types of tile, cement and concrete blocks. The materials require less energy and fewer resources.
Biological wastes are used as fuel and bamboo is used in the construction process.

Policy considerations
Public support and regulation can speed up
the adoption of green building practices in
the construction sector. Innovative building
regulation can also help improve resilience
and environmental quality in cities, as shown
in the examples in box 16.
Standard measurement and reporting requirements for building performance in
terms of energy efficiency and greenhouse
gas emissions can increase the use of sustainable construction in the real estate sector. They can also make it easier to embed
the environmental performance of buildings
into calculations of their financial value. Towards this end, the United Nations Environment Programme is piloting a common carbon metric that will measure emissions from
buildings based on energy use, such as in
heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and
appliances (see www.unep.org/sbci/Activities/CCM_Pilot.asp). This metric will allow
data-driven comparisons between buildings. In addition, the Bonn Centre for Local
Climate Action and Reporting, which was
established in December 2009 as an initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Council for
Local Environmental Initiatives–Local Governments for Sustainability, facilitates the
voluntary publication of city commitments,

actions and performance in terms of emission reductions (see www.carbonn.org). The
centre also provides guidance for emissions
reporting. A notable example of voluntary
reporting initiatives is the Greenprint Performance Report, which measures the energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
of assets owned by members of the Greenprint Foundation, a worldwide alliance of
real-estate investors.
Establishing multi-tier building rating systems
can guide the real estate sector in adopting
comprehensive green building standards.
Green building rating systems that certify
environmental building design strategies are
starting to be implemented globally. Notable
examples are the Green Rating for Integrated
Habitat Assessment in India, the Green Mark
initiative in Singapore, which aims to shift
Singapore’s construction industry towards
more environmentally friendly buildings,
the Building Research Establishment
Environmental Assessment Methodology in
the United Kingdom and the Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design certification
in the United States. The latter is provided
to buildings that are generally designed to
be healthier and safer for residents and to
operate at a lower cost and higher asset value,
reduce waste, conserve energy and water
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Green
building rating systems should be promoted

30

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Innovative building regulations in practice

Local governments may lead by example and implement energy-eﬃciency measures in new public buildings. For example,
the new city hall of Seoul uses a combination of photovoltaic, solar and geothermal energy for power generation.
Vienna, Austria has an energy-eﬃciency policy that subsidizes new housing projects based on a competitive selection process
that includes energy eﬃciency among its criteria. The city also partially subsidizes the refurbishment of existing buildings.
Stuttgart, Germany has analysed weather patterns to develop an urban climatic map and identify wind paths that transport
clean air into the city and improve air quality by reducing the heat-island eﬀect. As a result, constructing new buildings that
would prevent air ﬂow through these wind paths is prohibited.
As of 2016, new residences in England will be required comply with higher energy-eﬃciency standards, with heating energy demand levels corresponding to one-ﬁfth of current buildings and on-or-oﬀ-site renewable energy generation for all
building-related energy demands such as lighting and ventilation. By 2030, 2 to 3 million new homes will be built according
to these zero carbon standards.
Rooftops cover one-ﬁfth of urban surface areas. Green roofs can be used to provide insulation and thereby reduce
heating and cooling costs for buildings, while at the same time absorbing rainwater and ﬁltering pollutants so that the
cleaned water may be reused. Some countries such as Austria, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the United States are
introducing regulation that makes it compulsory to construct green roofs on all new buildings or allocating subsidies
for converting existing roofs. Toronto, Canada, is the ﬁrst city in North America to require green roofs on new buildings.
Several cities are also investing in rooftop gardens and trees that are designed to hold water. In Seattle, United States,
households are reimbursed for putting in place such rain gardens. Rainwater harvesting from roofs was made mandatory in Bangalore, India, through a water supply and sewerage bill in 2009. Existing buildings that do not install rainwater
harvesting structures are penalized.

first and foremost at the level of municipalities
and other local governance structures. Local
authorities should also provide transparent
information to the real estate sector on
green building construction costs, which are
normally lower than perceived by the public
and can easily be recuperated in the long
term owing to lower operating costs.
However, green buildings require higher
start-up costs. Local authorities can provide
construction companies with incentives such
as cash payments, loans or lower taxes, in
order that they may benefit from some of the
long-term savings resulting from the lower
resource use of ecological construction. If the
business model of green regulation passes
resource efficiency savings only to building
owners, construction companies may not be
willing to invest. Therefore, the introduction
of green building regulation should be
accompanied by information campaigns that
educate builders on the technical aspects
of new standards and by potential financial
incentives such as favourable tax policies or
interest rates that may compensate for the
extra start-up costs of green construction

(Municipal Government of Shanghai et al.,
2011).
Green buildings need not be confined to cities
in high-income countries. Local governments
in developing countries can address housing
shortages through construction initiatives
for affordable, sustainable housing and the
upgrading of informal settlements. box 17
provides examples of such programmes in
developing countries.

IV. d. Water and agriculture
The damage of urban sprawl on
peri-urban areas
Peri-urbanization, sometimes referred to as
spillover growth, refers to urban growth into
zones that lie between a city and rural zones,
usually without spatial planning and the
provision of basic services. Development of
city fringes that undergo peri-urbanization is
most often triggered by a real-estate boom
that accompanies rapid urban growth.
Populations that were previously rural

31

IV. Sustainable urban resource management

benefit from new economic dynamism in
manufacturing and services brought by
urbanization, yet they do not always enjoy
improvements in quality of life.
People living in peri-urban areas suffer the
consequences of unplanned urban growth
most intensely, as they face environmental
pollution, rapid social transformation and
poverty. Peri-urbanization also results in
conflicts in basic needs and resources such
as water. Although peri-urban zones in
developing countries are often neglected in
the process of urban growth and lack basic
services such as water and sanitation, they
have a key role to play in supplying cities
with food, energy, water, building materials
and critical ecosystem services. Their
success or failure has implications beyond
their vicinity. Since there is no return from
urbanization and no future in rural poverty,
the key question is in how to undertake the
right urbanization for peri-urban zones.
The rules for the administrative governance
of peri-urban areas are often unclear. Rapid
urbanization causes peri-urban zones to
undergo rapid transformations in land, social
structure and economic activity. The extension
of cities into peri-urban areas in developing
countries is often uncontrolled, and such
expansion can occur along a river or highway,
as well as around a single metropolitan area.
Due to a lack of regulation or planning, periurban areas face severe environmental,
Box 17.

economic and property-related challenges.
For instance, due to a lack of regulation,
some cities release waste into peri-urban
areas without facing any legal consequences.
Insufficient regulation can result in peri-urban
agriculture not being recognized as legal.
Urban sprawl causes property speculation
to increase land prices to unaffordable levels
for peri-urban residents (United Nations
Population Fund, 2008).
Many cities in developing countries expand
with little focus on protecting peri-urban
water systems or agricultural areas. Since
the peri-urban area is not incorporated
in city development plans, the effects
of urbanization on city fringes are not
properly assessed. For example, many of the
households in peri-urban zones are involved
in agriculture. A lack of understanding of
the way peri-urban agriculture is sustained
is a key issue affecting peri-urban farmers.
Land acquisition and the fragmentation
of land caused by urbanization disrupt the
livelihood of farmers. Their vulnerability is
also increased by industrial pollution and
the lack of prioritization of agricultural
programmes. In addition, opportunities for
greater economic return by selling or leasing
land decrease the attractiveness of future
peri-urban agricultural prospects (Marshall
et al., 2009).
Peri-urban zones on city fringes compete with
urban residential and industrial demands for

Sustainable housing programmes in practice

The United Nations Environment Programme is implementing a sustainable social housing initiative that was piloted in São
Paulo and Bangkok in order to build social housing units that are both energy-eﬃcient and low-cost.
Brazil and Mexico have housing programmes that aim to cover their housing shortages. Brazil’s My House My Life programme provides incentives and subsidies to enable mortgages for low-income households and includes solar water heaters in housing design. Mexico’s national housing programme subsidizes households for buying homes with pre-approved
ecological technologies. In addition, the National Workers’ Housing Fund Institute provides green mortgages of up to $1,250
to cover the cost of ecological technologies for low-income housing. The programme ﬁnances 22 technologies related to
electricity, gas, water and health. The programme beneﬁted over 3 million people between 2007 and 2012 and is being
expanded to the retroﬁtting of existing housing stock.
There are also successful examples of the upgrading of informal settlements. For example, settlements in Manaus, Brazil
were upgraded through the construction of parks, transport infrastructure and sewage pipes, as well as the provision of
basic services such as water, sanitation and electricity.

water. Growing urban zones endanger water
resources that are critical for agriculture. A
study conducted of Chennai, India, by the
Social, Technological and Environmental
Pathways to Sustainability Centre based at the
University of Sussex demonstrated that after
a water-use agreement was signed between
the urban water management authority and
rural farmers for the use of groundwater, periurban farmers were vulnerable to increased
urban and rural demand and resulting
price increases. Moreover, the water-use
agreement had counterproductive effects
on all parties. As urban water use increased,
excessive groundwater extraction led to
longer droughts, thereby also negatively
impacting urban citizens due to reduced food
production (Thapa et al., 2010).
Water scarcity can turn into a serious health
issue for both rapidly growing cities and periurban zones. The lack of water negatively
affects access to sanitation. The number of
inhabitants in cities of sub-Saharan Africa
without access to adequate sanitation more
than doubled between 1990 and 2010,
reaching 180 million (Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, 2012).
In Maputo, Mozambique, 20 per cent of the
population lacked access to potable water in
2003. Half of the 10 million citizens of Jakarta,
Indonesia had no access to potable water in
2007 (UN-Habitat, 2012c). Water consumption
is already excessive according to World Health
Organization norms and is likely to increase
further in cities such as the following: Porto
Alegre, Brazil; Nanjing, China; Johannesburg,
South Africa; Bangkok; Tunis, Tunisia; and
Montevideo, Uruguay. Water leakages and
abuse are severe problems in many countries.
The lack of water can thus be an inhibiting
factor to sound urban growth and peri-urban
livelihood.
The lack of healthy nutrition remains an
important issue in growing urban areas in
developing countries. More than half of
the urban residents in Africa live in slums,
are undernourished and have scarce
employment opportunities. Commercial
horticultural production of fresh fruits and
vegetables, widely practiced in peri-urban

zones especially in Africa, risks becoming
unsustainable due to the lack of means and
support. Horticulture and food production
are sources of nutrition and employment
for millions of urban Africans, yet they
receive little recognition, regulation or
support from their Governments. As a
result, an important opportunity for the
healthy nutrition of urban populations
and a source of employment, especially
for women workers, remains underutilized
(Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, 2012).
Science, technology and innovation for
water and agriculture
Urban farming and market gardening
Science, technology and innovation increase
the options for urban areas to become more
self-sufficient in terms of nutrition. In Asia,
Africa and Latin America, urban farming is
already a livelihood and survival strategy
for populations. Urban farming can also be
critical to supply food for disaster-struck urban
zones. Technologies and innovative models
are available to promote urban farming.
For example, school gardens represent an
innovative means to promote horticultural
production, while simultaneously improving
the quality of meals at schools, providing
practical nutrition education and increasing
household consumption. In addition, family
gardens may be established with links to
markets through cooperatives.
Integrating urban farming into urban and
peri-urban planning can produce multiple
benefits. As the spread of urban zones results
in a lack of space for food production, smallscale peri-urban market gardening can make
up for shortages in healthy, fresh food and
generate employment. Peri-urban farms
can reuse urban wastewater for irrigation
purposes. The production of fruit and
vegetables in small private farms close to
cities can be less costly than bringing supplies
from rural areas, due to lower transport costs.
Such production can also help contain urban
sprawl by creating urban green belts. box 18
presents an example of the implementation
of market gardening in Mozambique.

33

IV. Sustainable urban resource management

Box 18.

Mozambique: Market gardening

Mozambique demonstrates a good example of policymaking for successful market gardening in Africa. The
Government created green zones by organizing horticultural cooperatives in the capital city of Maputo and
other major cities after the civil war of the 1980s, which
disrupted food supplies and increased urban unemployment. These green zones produce a critical supply
of fresh vegetables such as cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, eggplants, beans and pumpkins. Despite exponential growth that occurred without planning or administrative control, most of the green zones have been
protected by the city council, sustaining the livelihood of
predominantly women farmers. Membership in farmers’
associations, which are aﬃliated with the General Union
of Cooperatives, made it possible to protect the land of
small-scale farmers from takeover by more wealthy farmers. The cooperative-based structure also supports farmers with ﬁnancing, technical assistance and market access. The green zones play a key economic role through
the production of healthy food on a small scale, the creation of employment opportunities and the use of urban
wastewater for irrigation purposes.

United Nations, 2012.

Water technologies
Since peri-urban communities in developing
countries largely depend on agriculture, water
is a key resource for their economic well-being.
Water storage, irrigation and water-lifting
technologies can help tackle water shortages.
For example, Grundfos, a Danish pump
manufacturer, developed and implemented
a solution to the challenge of providing
sustainable access to water for rural and periurban communities in the developing world.
The system, as implemented in Kenya, uses
solar energy to activate a pump that extracts
groundwater and distributes it through a
payment system that is managed locally.
The revenue from the pump is used for
maintaining the system. Grundfos is working
on introducing the system to other countries
(World Business Council for Sustainable
Development, 2012).
Phyto-remediation
Another innovative method for reusing urban
wastewater is phyto-remediation, that is, the
use of trees and plants to clean water, whereby

a drainage system channels wastewater into a
catchment that is filled with trees, which capture
the water and hold the waste. The cleaned water
is then reused for irrigation purposes.
Policy considerations
Peri-urbanization should take place as a
planned, managed transition. Regional
governance entities may be set up to establish
a framework of equitable regulation that
protects the environment, provides basic
services to the poor and resolves land disputes
that may arise from urban sprawl. It may even
be to the benefit of a region as a whole to set
city land-expansion limits, as set for example by
Portland, and to encourage more concentrated
development. Peri-urban areas can benefit
from social inclusion programmes that upgrade
existing informal settlements and prevent the
formation of new informal settlements through
adequate spatial planning. Peri-urban areas can
be integrated into the urban transport network
as well. Soweto, a township in South Africa that
was part of greater Johannesburg as a separate
municipality, was successfully integrated into
Johannesburg as a result of a planning and
investment effort that improved infrastructure,
accessibility, safety and public spaces and
provided new economic opportunities (UNHabitat, 2012c).
Formal means of public participation in decision-making can play a key role in preventing
resource conflicts between urban, peri-urban
and rural stakeholders during the process of
urbanization. Some countries have already established successful forms of participation in
urban decision-making. For example, in Brazil,
more than 70 cities have a participatory budget system that allows citizen participation
in decisions of resource allocation (Marshall
et al., 2009). The Coalition to Fight Poverty
(Mesa de Concertación para la Lucha Contra
la Pobreza) in Peru is a council of Government,
non-governmental organization, church and
community organization members that formulates short, medium and long-term priorities for community development in areas
of infrastructure, health, education, security,
recreation and employment (Marshall et al.,
2009).

34

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

Horticulture may be supported through
policies for urban zoning, building
irrigation systems and the establishment
of cooperatives that protect small-scale
farming. Agricultural cooperatives can sustain
agricultural production and the livelihood
of the peri-urban farming community
and industry in the face of urbanization.
Cooperative
structures
improve
the
accessibility of markets and provide logistical
support for individual farmers. Furthermore,
Governments can support peri-urban farming
through regulation. Tax policies can help
sustain peri-urban food production for cities,
thereby reducing the need to transport food
from other areas, which would potentially
increase food costs.
Water governance by a single unified
authority can help resolve water-related
conflicts in urban and peri-urban zones. For
Box 19.

example, in 1963 Singapore centralized its
water management through a public utilities
board. Within 40 years of centralization, twothirds of Singapore’s land surface became
a water catchment area that stored water
in 17 reservoirs. Singapore also collects
wastewater to produce drinking water and
thereby covers 30 per cent of the city’s needs
(Tan, 2012).
Peri-urban communities may benefit from
regional ecosystem assessments that
map their composition, interlinkages and
changes induced by urbanization, as shown
in the examples in box 19. Assessments can
document the vulnerabilities of peri-urban
zones with quantifiable data so that policies
may be developed to maintain landscapes
and ecosystems that are important for food
production, maintaining biodiversity and
tourism.

Ecosystem assessments in practice

Following up on the millennium ecosystem assessment released in 2005, the satoyama–satoumi assessment, a land and
marine ecosystem assessment, was conducted in Japan by the Institute of Advanced Studies of the United Nations University. The assessment was divided into ﬁve major regional clusters and identiﬁed the root causes of decline in both land
and marine ecosystems and the possible courses of action to reverse this trend. The most important root causes were land
use transformation, largely due to urbanization, and demographic changes such as ageing that made it harder to sustain
the landscapes, while the decline of these ecosystems negatively aﬀected health and well-being in Japan. The assessment
established that the two key challenges for the future were attracting participation by citizens and non-governmental
organizations in re-establishing land and marine ecosystem services and formulating economic incentives to protect noneconomic values in the landscapes.
Suncheon, a city on the south coast of the Republic of Korea, is a good example of an urban zone that has managed to
protect its surrounding ecosystems. Despite being surrounded by cities prioritizing heavy industry, the city has invested in
its ecosystems as of the late 1990s and turned Suncheon Bay into an award-winning ecotourism centre that attracts more
than 2.3 million visitors per year. Although businesses and landowners disagreed with the plan at the beginning, it was implemented with the mayor’s leadership and a clear vision of how the ecosystem approach would bring economic growth.

V. Recommendations and conclusion

V. Recommendations and conclusion
This report provides guidance on science,
technology and innovation-related policies
and practices that can lead to sustainable
urbanization by producing wider economic,
social and environmental benefits for cities.
The report details how cities that prioritize
sustainable growth patterns can improve
employment and competitiveness, enhance
social cohesion and create a healthy and
liveable urban environment. As seen in the
examples provided, many cities have achieved
success on a partial basis by implementing
some of the related technologies, yet the
same cities may have failed in other areas.
The best way to achieve sustainable
urbanization is for a city to implement integrated
comprehensive policies that take into account
all aspects such as spatial planning, mobility and
buildings, among others. Cities need to embed
sustainability in their urban plans and urban
development policies. If a sustainability mindset
is included in all sectors, there is a higher
likelihood of achieving success. Mobilizing
citizens to support this mindset is critical,
since without the participation of citizens,
policymakers cannot achieve objectives such as
sustainable resource management. Ultimately,
citizens are the ones who make decisions on
consumption patterns.
In order for science, technology and
innovation to be effective in bringing about
positive responses in cities in developing
countries, there is a need for strong diffusion
mechanisms. Science, technology and
innovation are widely available for sustainable
urbanization and the related tools are
constantly improving. Most significant for
developing countries is the need to ensure
that diffusion takes place where needed.
Solutions need to travel quickly from creators
to beneficiaries. However, as with the adoption
of science, technology and innovationrelated solutions, diffusion requires action
on multiple fronts. Diffusion models should
include capital accumulation and the local
capacity development of beneficiaries.

Urban infrastructure in a number of
developing countries, particularly least
developed countries, is inadequate and
insufficient to meet the needs of rapidly
growing populations and economies. The
lack of affordable housing furnished with
basic services such as water, sanitation
and electricity, especially for lower-income
groups, results in informal shelters being built
with no infrastructure, little sanitation and
no compliance with planning or building
regulations. Least developed countries have
particularly high urban growth rates and
require special consideration with regard
to meeting shelter, sanitation and other
infrastructure needs. Most least developed
countries are located in sub-Saharan Africa
and South-East Asia, where natural disasters
pose constant risks.
Science, technology and innovation-related
choices in developing country contexts differ
from those in developed countries due to
limitations in human resources, know-how
and financing, among others. Constraints
are particularly acute in least developed
countries, limiting their ability to cope with
the challenges of rapid urbanization and
to ensure even the bare minimum – food,
water and electricity – needed to sustain
the livelihoods of their citizens. Nevertheless,
science, technology and innovation have
a key role to play in fostering sustainable
urbanization in the developing world. The
particular nature of urbanization in least
developed countries requires customized
models of delivering science, technology
and innovation-related solutions, not least by
tapping into indigenous knowledge.
As demonstrated in this report, many of the
technologies that are useful in the urban
context in developing countries can be low
technology and therefore may not necessarily
require high financial resources or investments.
This report demonstrates that science,
technology and innovation for sustainable
urbanization often originate in developing

36

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

countries,
including
least
developed
countries. Several successful innovations such
as bus rapid transit systems, public–private
partnerships for waste management, urban
agriculture, models for public participation in
decision-making, disaster risk management
and sustainable housing programmes already
have been or have the potential to be applied
across the world.

with information and communications
technologies, which are accessible via
smart telephones and the Internet, requires
advanced technical know-how (Atlantic
Council, 2013). Technical cooperation on
innovative regulations may therefore speed
up the process of implementing sustainable
practices on a much wider scale in growing
cities in developing countries.

Developing countries have also successfully
demonstrated examples of creatively
combining low and high technology
according to local needs, as with some of
the technologies used for disaster resilience.
This report provides examples of how local
knowledge may be leveraged to implement
the construction of resource-efficient
buildings that are not necessarily expensive.
Many innovations originate in developing
countries, yet there is a need for mechanisms
to implement them more widely. In least
developed countries, urbanization rates are
still relatively low compared to other countries.
Making innovative ideas on urbanization
available to least developed countries can
help their cities follow the best path from
the start and minimize the cost of correcting
unhealthy urban practices later on.

Policy implications that may be derived from
this report to address the specific urbanization
needs of developing countries and least
developed countries are further detailed in
the following sections.

The examples given in this report illustrate the
benefits of establishing strong links between
national policies on science, technology
and innovation, particularly research and
development, and specific urbanization
issues, in order to develop local solutions
that address local needs. The report shows
how developed countries are taking the
lead with regard to innovative regulation in
the urban context. This may therefore be an
area for increased cooperation among cities
in the future. Developing countries and least
developed countries may need assistance
in putting in place beneficial business
models and urban governance structures
that can popularize science, technology
and innovation in high technology, low
technology or innovation forms. For instance,
while bicycling is a technology that has been
available for over a century, encouraging the
wide-scale adoption of bicycling in a city
through bicycle-sharing systems integrated

V. a. Urbanization as a key
consideration in national
innovation systems
Cities are one of the greatest innovation
tools developed by humans. They encourage
innovation through contact between people,
which may be either planned or serendipitous.
Creative inhabitants of cities constantly
design novel solutions. The same applies to
inhabitants of informal settlements, where
people must embody an entrepreneurial
spirit for their daily survival. It is important
for developing countries to harness this
innovative spirit and scale frugal innovation for
the benefit of the larger population. Increasing
the possibilities of public participation in
urban decision-making may enable this, as
seen in some of the examples provided in
this report. Urban citizens are best placed
to work with municipalities and identify
science, technology and innovation-related
requirements. Fostering cooperation between
national councils on science, technology and
innovation and local governments to solve
urban problems is also beneficial.
Furthermore, if the national innovation system
of a country prioritizes urbanization issues, this
may be a great benefit for its development
as, more often than not, urbanization and
development occur in parallel. Mainstreaming
sustainability into urban development plans
from the start can help to avoid costly and
difficult policy adjustments later on. While

V. Recommendations and conclusion

developing accurate long-term plans is
more challenging in rapidly growing urban
environments than in areas with constant
populations, new technologies can empower
urban planners by providing a greater
capability and capacity to plan ahead.

V. b. Mobilizing the private
sector and civil society
This report demonstrates the different
areas in which public–private partnerships,
particularly in developing countries, can have
a lasting impact on sustainable urbanization.
Such business models are valuable in terms
of scaling the innovation generated by small
organizations with the means available to
large organizations. Local governments can
also make public resources, such as open
data, available to private-sector enterprises
and community innovators. When local
communities work together with businesses,
they can steer innovation more effectively
towards answering their requirements.
For example, in Africa, the development
of electronic payment systems based on
mobile telephones led to the creation of new
marketplaces at a relatively low cost and with
low infrastructure requirements.
Sustainability examples from several cities
show that applying technology in highly
populated urban environments requires a
sound business model in order to succeed.
Popular adoption of new urban technologies
depends on whether they can replace current
habits and practices without disruption or
economic disadvantages. City managements
can increase the potential for entrepreneurs
to establish sound business models through
regulation, economic incentives and
information and awareness campaigns.
Local governments should also put in place a
comprehensive regulatory environment and
provide incentives to encourage the private
sector to participate in urban infrastructure
and technology projects. Public–private
partnerships
can
attract
investment
in sustainability projects. International
organizations and business associations can

37

assist in matching the sustainability needs
of cities with possible solutions from the
private sector. Municipalities can also receive
support from national Governments and
international organizations to create more
favourable conditions so that sustainable
practices do not remain expensive subsidydependent options but are turned into real
business opportunities (Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific et al., 2011
and United Nations Environment Programme,
2011).
Particularly in the context of least developed
countries, the social inclusion of slum areas
is a necessity. Social entrepreneurship is an
emerging business model that addresses
societal needs by bringing together
community innovators with private sector
entrepreneurs to fund social innovation as
a financially viable business. For example,
open-data initiatives can help populations
map their neighbourhoods. Cooperation
initiatives that include non-governmental
organizations can map slums and survey
households to integrate slums into future
urban development plans.
International organizations can contribute to
standard setting and technical cooperation
for sustainable urbanization. They can raise
awareness among urban policymakers of the
role of science, technology and innovation for
sustainable urban development in developing
countries, with a special focus on least
developed countries, by serving as a forum for
the sharing of good practices and experiences.
In particular, international organizations can
share and analyse evidence of successful
examples of local innovation models that
provide solutions to pressing urban challenges
based on science, technology and innovation,
including serving as incubators,. They can
also share and analyse evidence of business
models that scale innovative interdisciplinary
solutions to city management and provide
them to beneficiaries. Formal cooperation
and technology transfer mechanisms can
be established within relevant international
organizations, such as the Clean Development
Mechanism of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.

38

Science, Technology and Innovation for Sustainable Urbanization

V. c. Innovative governance
and financing models
The highlighted case studies from around the
world demonstrate the need for cities to form a
coalition of public, private and civil society actors
and multilevel governance models in their
transition to sustainability. Since policy changes
related to prioritizing public transport, saving
energy and efficient buildings, among others,
affect all stakeholders that take part in urban life,
they require consensus-based decision-making
to succeed. Cities need to envisage and put in
place legal participation mechanisms. Broad
public participation can help gather input and
promote consensus on urban projects, leading
to cities that are more socially inclusive.
Sectors of urban management are interlinked.
The absence of cross-sectoral policies can
lead to fragmented governance, which is
counterproductive and can lead to unexpected
and unwanted outcomes. For example, rebound
effects can occur in cases where the introduction
of energy-saving technologies actually leads to
an increase in per capita energy consumption
(United Nations Environment Programme, 2011).
Local governments in developing countries
can launch cross-sectoral sustainability goals
covering mobility, energy, buildings, water and
waste. Science, technology and innovation have
an essential role to play in addressing crosssectoral sustainability challenges. For instance,
information and communications technologies
can be used to bring together data from different
city departments and enable coordinated
simultaneous responses to challenges.
Science, technology and innovation are
important for urban economic dynamism
and employment. Urban economies need
to innovate and take a regional approach in
order to provide employment for incoming
populations. Assessing the advantages of the
region and ensuring the integration of a city
with its region are necessary to generate new
employment. Formal governance mechanisms
that enhance cooperation between national,
regional and local governments can assist
spatial planning at the regional level. Such
governance models may even be developed

across countries. An overall view of the
regional economic landscape can help in
forming a vibrant economic cluster. Science,
technology and innovation make it possible
to undertake regional work and exchange
ideas more easily. Examples include regional
planning and governance models that are
being practiced in different urban hubs in
Asia, including the Malacca Straits Diagonal,
the Pearl River Delta and Metropolitan Manila
(International Society of City and Regional
Planners, 2012).
Public financial support for science,
technology and innovation-related initiatives
and start-ups oriented towards sustainable
urbanization solutions is important. New forms
of financial services are emerging, driven by
the opportunities created by information and
communications technologies (Robinson,
2012). For example, crowdfunding, peer-topeer lending, sustainable investment funds
and local and electronic currencies are all
innovations that can be used to finance
projects related to sustainable urbanization. In
addition, new sources of investment capital,
such as retirement and sovereign wealth
funds, can finance science, technology and
innovation-based solutions, in particular at a
smaller scale, for sustainable urbanization.

V. d. Inter-city learning as an
opportunity area
Cities of the world learn from one another.
City-to-city knowledge exchanges on science,
technology and innovation facilitate both
North-South and South-South collaboration
in sharing experiences on issues such as
urban planning and design, mobility and
efficient urban resource management. For
example, since the European Union–Latin
America and Caribbean summit in Madrid
on 18 May 2010, the two regions have been
undertaking joint efforts on smart cities,
among other topics. A mapping exercise is
being conducted to identify priorities on new
biregional cooperation possibilities for smart
cities. The objective is to constitute a database
of biregional projects related to information
and communications technologies, as well

V. Recommendations and conclusion

as applications and technologies deployed in
thematic areas including smart cities to allow
for the identification of twinning projects,
funding instruments and collaborating
institutions. It is based on an exploratory
survey of cooperation on information and
communications
technologies
through
contact with national funding agencies in
both regions.
At the level of mayors and municipalities,
barriers between North and South are less
significant, since solutions to urban problems
can originate from anywhere. Cities help
break barriers to learning among countries
and regions. For example, the bus rapid transit
system in Curitiba has been reapplied in many
parts of the world, including in developed
countries. Accelerating inter-city learning
is a key opportunity for diffusing science,
technology and innovation on a much wider
scale towards sustainable urbanization in
developing countries.
Multilateral and bilateral technology banks
can be established to speed up the transfer of
knowledge and experience on projects that are
implemented in cities with similar problems.
International local government networks
such as Cities Alliance, the C40 Cities Climate
Leadership Group, the International Council
for Local Environmental Initiatives–Local
Governments for Sustainability, United Cities
and Local Governments and the World Urban
Campaign coordinated by UN-Habitat are
already playing an important role in increasing
awareness of sustainability, circulating best
practices and providing a platform for joint
projects. Action at a mayoral level is effective
since mayors regulate, operate or even own
infrastructure such as roads, buildings and
street lights, as well as public transport, land
use planning and waste collection.

V. e. Cities undergoing a
process of perpetual
urbanization
Urbanization
is
not
a
one-time
phenomenon and therefore not only a
consideration for developing countries. It

39

is perpetual. Cities continuously undergo a
process of transformation by reimagining
their existing infrastructure in the context
of what becomes possible through science,
technology and innovation. In many cities
of developed countries, urbanization is
occurring in the form of reurbanization,
for instance to deindustrialize, to
accommodate for ageing citizens and to
improve resource management.
The nature of urbanization may change,
yet it remains a continuously evolving
process. In order to make this continuous
process sustainable, cities need to consider
science, technology and innovation
options whenever they embark on new
infrastructure investments and plans.
They should continuously benefit from
ecological solutions as they emerge,
perpetually replacing obsolete and old
infrastructure with more efficient and
environmentally friendly infrastructure.
They need to have mechanisms that assess
the evolution of new technologies and
innovative means of urban governance,
in order to gradually integrate these into
their domain.
Cities are already thinking of ways to
repurpose their obsolete infrastructure.
For example, New York City is piloting the
use of its 12,500 public telephone booths
as information nodes. A similar pilot that
reuses public telephone booths as electric
automobile-charging facilities is being
run by Telekom Austria (Burnham, 2013).
Such examples are encouraging proof that
there is potential for cities at any stage of
development to innovate and learn from
other cities.
Since urbanization is a perpetual phenomenon, there needs to be a constant evolutionary transformation of infrastructure to adapt
to the current requirements of citizens.
Cities should implement sustainable
policies first and foremost because they
improve the lives of their inhabitants.
Ultimately, cities should be constructed so
that they serve their citizens and not the
other way around.
