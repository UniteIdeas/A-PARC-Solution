Foreword

Production concentrates in big cities, leading provinces, and wealthy nations. Half the world’s
production fits onto 1.5 percent of its land. Cairo produces more than half of Egypt’s GDP,
using just 0.5 percent of its area. Brazil’s three south-central states comprise 15 percent of
its land, but more than half its production. And North America, the European Union, and
Japan—with fewer than a billion people—account for three-quarters of the world’s wealth.
But economic concentration leaves out some populations. In Brazil, China, and India,
for example, lagging states have poverty rates more than twice those in dynamic states.
More than two-thirds of the developing world’s poor live in villages. A billion people, living in the poorest and most isolated nations, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South and
Central Asia, survive on less than 2 percent of the world’s wealth.
These geographically disadvantaged people cope every day with the reality that development does not bring economic prosperity everywhere at once; markets favor some places
over others. But dispersing production more broadly does not necessarily foster prosperity.
Economically successful nations both facilitate the concentration of production and institute policies that make people’s living standards—in terms of nutrition, education, health,
and sanitation—more uniform across space. Getting the benefits of both economic concentration and social convergence requires policy actions aimed at economic integration.
Integration should begin with institutions that ensure access to basic services such as
primary education, primary health care, adequate sanitation, and clean drinking water for
everyone. As integration becomes more difficult, adaptive policies should include roads, railways, airports, harbors, and communication systems that facilitate the movement of goods,
services, people, and ideas locally, nationally, and internationally. For places where integration
is hardest, for social or political reasons, the response should be commensurately comprehensive, with institutions that unite, infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target,
such as slum upgrading programs or incentives for producers to locate in certain areas.
Using these principles, World Development Report 2009, the 31st in the series, reframes
the policy debates on urbanization, territorial development, and regional integration. The
report analyzes the early experience of developed countries and draws practical implications
for urbanization policies in today’s developing countries. For the poorest countries in Africa
and Asia that are landlocked or otherwise isolated from world markets, the Report discusses
promising approaches to regional integration that combine institutional cooperation, shared
infrastructure, and special incentives. In growing middle-income economies, general prosperity can camouflage areas of persistent poverty. For such countries, the Report outlines
strategies to foster domestic integration and help the poor in the least fortunate places.
I expect that Reshaping Economic Geography will stimulate a much-needed discussion
on the desirability of “balanced growth,” which has proved elusive. And by informing
some important policy debates, it will point the way toward more inclusive and sustainable development.

Data notes
The countries included in regional and income groupings in this Report are listed in the
Classification of Economies table at the beginning of the Selected World Development
Indicators. Income classifications are based on gross national income (GNP) per capita;
thresholds for income classifications in this edition may be found in the Introduction to
Selected World Development Indicators. Group averages reported in the figures and tables
are unweighted averages of the countries in the group, unless noted to the contrary.
The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World
Bank about the legal or other status of a territory. The term developing countries includes
low- and middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from
central planning, as a matter of convenience. The terms industrialized countries or developed countries may be used as a matter of convenience to denote high-income economies.
Dollar figures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified. Billion means 1,000
million; trillion means 1,000 billion.

Geography in motion

The Report at a Glance—Density, Distance,
and Division
Growing cities, ever more mobile people, and increasingly specialized products are integral to development. These changes have
been most noticeable in North America, Western Europe, and Northeast Asia. But countries in East and South Asia and Eastern
Europe are now experiencing changes that are similar in their scope and speed. World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography concludes that such transformations will remain essential for economic success in other parts of the developing
world and should be encouraged.

Seeing development in 3-D
These transformations bring prosperity, but they do not happen without
risk and sacrifice. Look at three of the
world’s most prosperous places:
• The first is Tokyo, the largest city in
the world with 35 million people,
a quarter of Japan’s population,
packed into less than 4 percent of its
land.
• The second is the United States, the
largest economy in the world and
perhaps also the most mobile, where
about 35 million people change residences each year.
• The third is Western Europe, the
most connected continent in the
world today, where countries trade
about 35 percent of their gross
domestic product (GDP), more than
half among neighbors.
Visitors to Tokyo can see people
being crushed into trains by professional train-packers. Millions of people willingly subject themselves to the
unpleasantness of such a crush. A map
of Japan’s economic density shows why.
Tokyo generates a big part of Japan’s
wealth—to get a share of it, people
have to live close by (see map G0.1).
The most striking feature of this map
is density—the concentration of wealth
in Tokyo and Osaka.
In the United States, each year in
the days before the Thanksgiving holiday, about 35 million people try to get
back to their families and friends. It is

WDR09_00_FMGIM0.indd xix

the start of winter in some parts of the
country, so flights often are canceled.
But Americans put up with the pain of
leaving friends and family, because economic activity is concentrated in a few
parts of the country (see map G0.2). To
get a part of this wealth, you have to get
closer to it. That is why 8 million Ameri-

cans change states every year, migrating
to reduce their distance to economic
opportunity. The most striking feature
of this map is distance.
Across the Atlantic, in Western
Europe, another massive movement
takes place every day—not of people
but of products. One example is Airbus,

countries. Huge sections of aircraft are

specialize in making different parts and
producing them in scale. Countries in

a region that was divided not so long
ago now trade with former enemies to
become an ever-more-integrated European Union (EU). As this integration
has increased, economic divisions have
decreased, making specialization and
scale possible (see map G0.3).
What is the payoff for this pain? A
map of economic geography, which
resizes the area of a country to reflect
its GDP, shows the benefits of big cities, mobile people, and connected
countries. The United States, Western
Europe, and Japan dominate the world’s
economy (see map G0.4).
Cities, migration, and trade have
been the main catalysts of progress in
the developed world over the past two
centuries. These stories are now being
repeated in the developing world’s most
dynamic economies.
• Mumbai is not the largest city in
the world, but it is the most densely
populated. And it keeps growing.
• China is not the largest economy in
the world, but it is the fastest growing
and may be among the most mobile.
• Southeast Asia may not have formed
a political union like Europe, but it
trades parts of goods back and forth
as the EU does.
People risk loss of life or limb on
Mumbai’s packed trains to take advan-

tage of economic density. Despite the
crush among commuters and in such
slums as Dharavi, Mumbai’s population has doubled since the 1970s. Since
the 1990s, millions of Chinese workers have migrated to get closer to economic opportunity concentrated along
the coast. Just as Americans travel during Thanksgiving, more than 200 million people in China travel during the
Chinese New Year. Regional production networks in East Asia are spread
far wider than Airbus sites in Western
Europe. East Asian countries may not
trade airplane parts, but nations that
once were enemies now trade parts of
cars and computers with the same frequency and speed.
And what is the payoff? We can
again recognize the shapes of China,
India, and Southeast Asian countries
on the map of the world’s economic
geography (see map G0.4). Contrast
these shapes with that of the mighty
continent of Africa, which shows up as
a slender peninsula.
The World Development Report
argues that some places are doing well
because they have promoted transformations along the three dimensions of
economic geography:
• Higher densities, as seen in the
growth of cities.
• Shorter distances, as workers and
businesses migrate closer to density.
• Fewer divisions, as countries thin
their economic borders and enter
world markets to take advantage of
scale and specialization.
The United States and Japan
reshaped their economic geography
along these lines in the past. China is
reshaping its economic geography now.
This Report proposes that these will be
the changes that will help developing
nations in other parts of the world,
most notably Africa.

Unbalanced growth, inclusive

Report proposes, and the Report is

structured to bring out the message (see
figure G0.1).
• Part one describes the changes along
the dimensions of density, distance,
and division—taking up each in
turn. It summarizes the experience
of the past century or so.
• Part two analyzes the drivers of these
transformations—the market forces
of agglomeration, migration, and
specialization and trade. It distills
the findings of policy research during the past generation or so.
• Part three discusses the policy implications of the experience and analysis in the first two parts. It provides
a common framework for reframing
three policy debates—on urbanization, on lagging areas within countries, and on regional integration
and globalization.
The Report is structured and written
in such a way that people interested in
only one of these debates can read just
some of it. That is, it can be read vertically. The chapters on density, agglomeration, and urbanization should

WDR09_00_FMGIM0.indd xxi

interest all countries—small and large,
low income and middle income. The
chapters on distance, factor mobility,
and regional development may be of
most interest to larger middle-income
countries. And the chapters on division,
transport costs, and regional integration
may be of most interest to low-income
and smaller economies.
Four spotlights on Geography in
Motion examine the interplay between
market forces and government policies
in North America, Western Europe,
East Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. By
highlighting the interactions among the
three dimensions, they also connect the
Report’s different parts.
Seen another way, the Report examines the most important policy issues
of economic geography, from local, to
national, to international. Locally, the
policy issue in areas such as Lagos state
in southern Nigeria is how to manage
urbanization. Nationally, the policy
issue in Nigeria is how to manage the
disparities in resources and living standards in the north and the south. And
internationally, the policy issue in West

Africa is how to make a better economic
union that benefits both the landlocked
and the coastal countries, the poorest
and the more prosperous.
As the geographic scale increases
from local to national to international,
the specific policy issue changes. But
the underlying problem is the same—
some places do well, others do not. And
it is difficult for anyone to accept this as
inevitable.
The Report’s main message is that
economic growth will be unbalanced.
To try to spread out economic activity is to discourage it. But development
can still be inclusive, in that even people
who start their lives far away from economic opportunity can benefit from
the growing concentration of wealth in
a few places. The way to get both the
benefits of uneven growth and inclusive development is through economic
integration.

Economic integration—local,
national, and international

thing to integrate rural and urban areas,
and slums with other parts of cities. It
means another to integrate lagging
and leading provinces within a nation.
And it means yet another to integrate
isolated and well-connected countries.
These notions of economic integration
are central to three debates in development—urbanization, territorial development, and international integration.
Urbanization

The arguments and evidence in World
Development Report 2009 can set priorities for policies at different stages of
urbanization, essentially providing the
elements of an urbanization strategy.
Each territory or area within a nation
has a specific geography. But the principles are quite universal.
• In places mostly rural, governments
should be as neutral as possible and
should establish the institutional
foundation for possible urbanization in some places. Good land policies are central, and so are policies to
provide basic services to everyone. A
good example is Costa Rica.

WDR09_00_FMGIM0.indd xxii

• In places urbanizing rapidly, governments must put in place, in
addition to institutions, connective
infrastructure so that the benefits
of rising economic density are more
widely shared. A good example is
Chongqing, China.
• In places where urbanization has
advanced, in addition to institutions
and infrastructure, targeted interventions may be necessary to deal
with slums. But these interventions
will not work unless institutions for
land and basic services are reasonably effective and transport infrastructure is in place. A good example
is Bogotá, Colombia.
Territorial development

The principles also can reshape the
debate on territorial or regional development. The tools of geography can identify which places are poor—the lagging
areas—and where most of the poor live.
Often, the two are not the same, because
the poor have the most reason to move
from poor places. The Report discusses
how governments can tailor policies to

integrate areas within nations, while
reducing poverty everywhere.
Lagging areas have one thing in
common—they are economically distant from places doing well. But besides
this, the economic geography of different areas is not the same:
• In some countries, such as China,
lagging areas are sparsely populated.
It does not make a lot of sense to
spread expensive infrastructure into
these places—or to give firms incentives to move to them. What makes
much more sense is to provide basic
services everywhere, even if it costs
more to reach these distant areas.
Encouraging mobility of people is
the priority, and institutions that
make land markets work better and
provide security, schools, streets, and
sanitation should be the mainstay of
integration policy.
• In other countries, such as Brazil,
lagging areas are densely populated.
As in China, poor people have moved
in the millions from the northeast
to the southeast. Everyone speaks

10/16/08 9:46:48 AM

Geography in Motion

the same language, and domestic
mobility is not difficult. But many
poor people still live in the northeast. Encouraging mobility of people
from the northeast is important, but
so is enabling access to markets in
the dynamic southeast. In such cases,
both institutions and infrastructure
to connect the two coastal areas are
necessary for economic integration.
• In a third group of countries, such as
India, lagging areas are densely populated—almost 60 percent of India’s
poor live in these poor places—and
people can find it difficult to migrate
to places doing well, such as the capital area and the south. Language
and cultural differences within
some areas can be considerable. In
such cases, institutions and infrastructure could be complemented by
incentives to producers to locate in
these lagging states. But these incentives should be carefully designed to
avoid offsetting the unifying effects
of common institutions and connective infrastructure. A promising

possibility is providing incentives to
agriculture and allied activities that
are appropriate for states that are
still mostly rural.
Regional integration

Finally, the principles developed in this
Report inform the debates on how to
make globalization work for all countries. The same logic applied at the
local and national levels can be used at
the international level to classify world
regions by the difficulty of economic
integration in these regions. The common problem is division—thick economic borders. Aside from this, the task
of integration varies in different parts
of the developing world:
• Countries in regions close to world
markets, such as Central America,
North Africa, and Eastern Europe,
face a relatively straightforward task
of integration. Common institutions
can help them become extensions of
these large markets.
• Countries in regions distant from
world markets, but with large home

xxiii

markets attractive to investors, face a
more difficult challenge. Good institutions and regional infrastructure
can help them access these markets.
Examples include East Asia and,
increasingly, South Asia. Southern
Africa and South America can also
integrate globally by making their
home markets bigger and more specialized through regional institutions and infrastructure.
• Integration is hardest for countries
in regions that are divided, are distant from world markets, and lack
the economic density provided by a
large local economy. These countries
include those nicknamed the “bottom billion”—East, Central, and West
Africa; Central Asia; and the Pacific
Islands. For these countries, all three
instruments are needed—regional
institutions that thin borders, regional
infrastructure that connects countries,
and such incentives as preferential
access to world markets, perhaps conditioned on ensuring that all countries
strengthen regional cooperation.

One thing is common to the policy debates on urbanization, area development, and globalization. In their current form, they overemphasize geographic targeting—what to do in rural areas or in slums, what to do in lagging states or remote areas, and what to do
in the most poor or landlocked countries. The Report reframes these debates in a way that better conforms to the reality of growth and
development. The reality is that the interaction between leading and lagging places is the key to economic development. The reality is
that spatially targeted interventions are just a small part of what governments can do to help places that are not doing well. The reality
is that, besides place-based incentives, governments have far more potent instruments for integration. They can build institutions that
unify all places and put in place infrastructure that connects some places to others.
The Report calls for rebalancing these policy discussions to include all the instruments of integration—institutions that unify,
infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target. And it shows how to use the three dimensions of density, distance, and
division to tailor the use of these policy instruments to address integration challenges that range from the relatively straightforward
to the most complicated.

Overview

Economic growth will be unbalanced, but development still can be inclusive—that is the message of this year’s World Development Report. As economies grow from low to high income,
production becomes more concentrated spatially. Some places—cities, coastal areas, and connected countries—are favored by producers. As countries develop, the most successful ones also
institute policies that make living standards of people more uniform across space. The way to get
both the immediate benefits of the concentration of production and the long-term benefits of a
convergence in living standards is economic integration.
Although the problems of economic integration defy simple solutions, the guiding principle
does not have to be complex. The policy mix should be calibrated to match the difficulty of the
development challenge, determined by the economic geography of places. Today, policy discussions about geographic disparities in development often start and end with a consideration of
spatially targeted interventions. The Report reframes these debates to include all instruments for
economic integration—institutions, infrastructure, and incentives. The bedrock of integration
efforts should be spatially blind institutions. As the challenges posed by geography become more
difficult, the response should include connective infrastructure. In places where integration is
hardest, the policy response should be commensurately comprehensive: institutions that unite,
infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target.

Place and prosperity
Place is the most important correlate of a
person’s welfare. In the next few decades, a
person born in the United States will earn a
hundred times more than a Zambian, and live
three decades longer. Behind these national
averages are numbers even more unsettling.
Unless things change radically, a child born
in a village far from Zambia’s capital, Lusaka,
will live less than half as long as a child born
in New York City—and during that short
life, will earn just $0.01 for every $2 the New
Yorker earns. The New Yorker will enjoy a
lifetime income of about $4.5 million, the
rural Zambian less than $10,000.
A Bolivian man with nine years of
schooling earns an average of about $460
per month, in dollars that reflect purchasing power at U.S. prices. But the same person

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 1

would earn about three times as much in the
United States. A Nigerian with nine years of
education would earn eight times as much in
the United States than in Nigeria. This “place
premium” is large throughout the developing world.1 The best predictor of income in
the world today is not what or whom you
know, but where you work.

Bumps, curves, and spills
These disparities in incomes and living standards are the outcome of a striking attribute
of economic development—its unevenness
across space. Somewhat unfairly, prosperity does not come to every place at the same
time. This is true at all geographic scales,
from local to national to global. Cities
quickly pull ahead of the countryside. Living standards improve in some provinces

while others lag. And some countries grow
to riches while others remain poor. If economic density were charted on a map of
the world, the topography at any resolution
would be bumpy, not smooth.
Location remains important at all stages
of development, but it matters less for living
standards in a rich country than in a poor
one. Estimates from more than 100 living
standard surveys indicate that households
in the most prosperous areas of developing
countries—such as Brazil, Bulgaria, Ghana,
Indonesia, Morocco, and Sri Lanka—have
an average consumption almost 75 percent
higher than that of similar households
in the lagging areas of these countries.
Compare this with less than 25 percent
for such developed countries as Canada,
Japan, and the United States. In contrast,
as a country grows richer, location becomes
more important for economic production.
Ghana, Poland, and New Zealand—three
medium-size countries with land areas of
about 250,000 square kilometers—have
vastly different per capita gross national
incomes of about $600, $9,000, and $27,000,
respectively. The most economically dense
5 percent of the country’s area produces
about 27 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in Ghana, 31 percent in Poland, and
39 percent in New Zealand.
Put another way, as countries develop,
location matters less for families and more
for firms. Development seems to give a place
the ability to reap the economic advantages
of rising concentrations of production, and
to obtain the social benefits that come from
a convergence in consumption. Economic
development thus brings with it the conditions of even greater prosperity, in a virtuous circle.
Another stylized fact: neighborhoods
matter. A prosperous city seldom leaves its
periphery mired in poverty. A province’s
prosperity is sooner or later shared with
those nearby. And neighboring countries
share not just political borders but economic destinies. North America, Western
Europe, and East Asia are now prosperous
neighborhoods. Within these regions, all
countries did not grow in lockstep. Within
countries, some provinces did better, and
within each province, prosperity came at
different times to cities, towns, and villages.

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 2

Less widely appreciated is the fact that
places near prosperous provinces, countries, and regions have invariably benefited.
Prosperity produces congestion and causes
economic activity to spill over, but only to
places that are well connected to these prosperous parts. The detrimental effects of
poverty, instability, and confl ict spill over
as well. To prosperous places, proximity is
a blessing, to poor places, a curse.
These three attributes of development—
geographic unevenness, circular causation,
and neighborhood effects—have not always
received much attention. They should,
because they have radical implications for
public policy.

•

•

•

Geographic unevenness—the first attribute of development—implies that
governments generally cannot simultaneously foster economic production and
spread it out smoothly.
Circular causation—the second attribute—provides hope for policy makers
wishing to pursue progressive objectives.
Rising concentrations of economic production are compatible with geographic
convergence in living standards. And the
market forces of agglomeration, migration, and specialization can, if combined
with progressive policies, yield both a
concentration of economic production
and a convergence of living standards.
Neighborhood effects—the third attribute—come with a principle for policy
making: promote economic integration.
Unevenness and circularity imply that it
is more difficult for places left behind to
catch up. But spillovers point to the promise for surmounting this handicap. Economic integration is an effective and the
most realistic way to harness the immediate benefits from concentration to achieve
the long-term benefits of convergence.

Putting this principle of economic integration into practice requires identifying
the market forces and government policies that best support the concentration
of economic mass and the convergence of
living standards across different locations.
It also requires recognizing that these market forces can be strong or weak depending on economic geography. Earlier World

Overview

Development Reports have studied these phenomena. This Report advances the influence
of geography on economic opportunity by
elevating space and place from mere undercurrents in policy to a major focus.

The problem—at three geographic scales
Depending on the “geographic scale,” the
market forces to be harnessed or supported
differ. At a smaller scale—say, an area within
a country (a province or state)—geography
poses different challenges than at a larger
geographic scale—say, a country. At an even
larger geographic scale—say, a group of
countries that form a geographic region—the
market forces that work toward integration
can be blocked by even greater geographic
and political obstacles (see box 1).
Locally, the concentration of economic production as countries develop is

B OX 1

manifest in urbanization. In East Asia, for
example, if current trends continue, the
urban population is expected to increase
by about 450 million people over the next
two decades, as countries in the regions
grow, adding the equivalent of a Paris
every month. In South and Central Asia,
the increase is expected to be almost 350
million. And in Sub-Saharan Africa—if
economies continue to grow—the urban
population could increase by 250 million
between 2005 and 2025. In other parts of
the developing world, within-urban transformations will be as important.
The question is whether growing concentrations of humanity will increase
prosperity, or produce congestion and
squalor. Another concern is the divergence in living standards between those
who benefit most from this geographic

Three geographic scales: local, national, and international

Consider the “neighborhoods” of Lagos
State, Nigeria, and West Africa (see the
maps below).
• The first geographic scale is the area.
The state of Lagos in southwestern
Nigeria has the five districts of Badagry,
Epe, Ikeja, Ikorodu, and Lagos, covering about 3,500 square kilometers. Its
estimated population density—with
the smallest land area but among the
two most populous in the nation—is
about 2,600 persons per square kilometer. Metropolitan Lagos has a density
more than three times that, fueled by

agglomeration economies and ruralurban migration.
• The second geographic scale is the country. With its 36 states and capital area
and covering 924,000 square kilometers, Nigeria is the world’s 32nd largest country. The distance from Lagos
to the northeastern tip of Nigeria is
almost 1,500 kilometers. The southern
states have seaports and oilfields. The
northern part, once a seat of ancient
empires, now has higher poverty.
Migration between the north and the
south is not an easy matter because

of religious and linguistic diff erences.
The sharing of oil wealth is a source of
tension.
• The third geographic scale is the region.
Nigeria’s West African neighbors
include Cameroon, the Central African
Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial
Guinea, Ghana, Niger, and Togo. The
region covers more than 6 million
square kilometers, divided by some of
the world’s thickest borders.

concentration—essentially urbanites in
prosperous neighborhoods—and those left
behind in villages and those living in slums,
estimated to number about 1 billion in the
developing world (see map 1, panel a). The
(ineffective) policy responses so far have
been to try to slow down urbanization.
At the national scale, economic growth
displays a similar unevenness, as places close
to large markets prosper sooner than places
more distant. In China the coastal provinces—mainly in the three areas known as the
Bohai Basin, the Pearl River Delta, and the
Yangtze River Delta—accounted for more
than half of the country’s GDP in 2005,
with less than a fifth of its area. In Brazil
the south-central states of Minas Gerais,
Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo account for
more than 52 percent of the country’s GDP,
with less than 15 percent of its land area.
Greater Cairo produces 50 percent of the
Arab Republic of Egypt’s GDP, using just
0.5 percent of its land area.
Politicians generally view this economic
imbalance disapprovingly. In communist
Russia the government labored to reduce
the economic share of the old industrial
area of St. Petersburg, the Center, and the
mid-Urals from 65 percent to 32 percent,
forcibly shifting production to the eastern
areas. It boosted the share of the east in economic production from 4 percent in 1925
to 28 percent at the end of communism,
whose demise probably was hastened by the
spatial inefficiency that these efforts engendered. Because governments care so much
about domestic disparities, they jeopardize
competitiveness and risk collapse. Policies
to reduce interstate or provincial disparities in production and living standards are
commonplace—but largely ineffective.
About 1 billion people continue to live in
these inhospitable lagging areas (see map 1,
panel b).
At the international scale, economic
growth has concentrated global production in a few regions, with commensurate
differences in incomes. In 2000 about
three-quarters of world GDP was concentrated in North America, Western Europe,
and Northeast Asia. This concentration is
not new. Three centuries ago, China and
India accounted for about two-thirds of
the world’s wealth. What was different then

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 5

5

is that they also had more than half of the
world’s population; the European Union
(EU), Japan, and the United States have less
than one-sixth.
Today, the worry at the international
level is the high poverty, illiteracy, and
mortality in some parts of the world, set
against the prosperity, literacy, and longevity in others. The policy responses include
foreign aid and multilateral efforts to ease
international trade and investment flows.
But barriers to the agricultural exports of
developing countries remain considerable,
and apathy for people distant or distinct
renders aid flows miniscule. Aid will be a
small part of the solution. Even in the European Union, with a combined GDP of about
€8 trillion, annual aid through the structural and cohesion funds will average less
than €50 billion between 2007 and 2013.
Foreign aid is less than 0.5 percent of the
gross national income of giving countries,
and not even a large fraction of the GDP
of countries home to the “bottom billion”
who have 12 percent of the world’s population, but less than 1 percent of its GDP (see
map 1, panel c).2
A billion slum dwellers in the developing
world’s cities, a billion people in fragile lagging areas within countries, a billion at the
bottom of the global hierarchy of nations—
these overlapping populations pose today’s
biggest development challenges. Seemingly
disparate, they share a fundamental feature:
at different spatial scales, they are the most
visible manifestation of economic geography’s importance for development.
Concern for these intersecting 3 billion
sometimes comes with the prescription that
economic growth must be made more spatially balanced. The growth of cities must
be controlled. Rural-urban gaps in wealth
must be reduced quickly. Lagging areas and
provinces distant from domestic and world
markets must be sustained through territorial development programs that bring jobs
to the people living there. And growing
gaps between the developed and developing
world must be addressed through interventions to protect enterprises in developing
countries until they are ready to compete.
World Development Report 2009 has
a different message: economic growth
is seldom balanced. Efforts to spread it

The three dimensions of development: density, distance, and division

This Report uses three geographic dimensions to describe the transformation of
economies as they develop (part one)
and the conditions to keep in mind when
formulating policies (part three). The
words are easy metaphors, since density,
distance, and division summon images of
human, physical, and political geography.
But they can be measured. Consider this
illustration.
In 2003 Nigeria had 45 million goats and
kids, 28 million sheep and lambs, and 15
million cattle. In a typical year 8 million
sheep, 7 million goats, and 0.5 million
cattle are slaughtered, mostly in five northern states including Kano. More than half
the hides are consumed as pomo. The rest
are sold to tanneries. The demand from
tanneries exceeds local supply, so animals
are imported from nearby Chad, Niger,
and Cameroon. Goat and sheep skins are
good business—in 2001 Nigeria produced
30 million to 35 million of them, exporting
almost all to Europe.
Density. Consider the market conditions for a tannery that produces leather
in the city of Kano in Northern Nigeria.
Officially, the population of Kano State is
about 9 million, large enough to provide
the skilled labor and infrastructure for
its tanneries. Due to the concentration
of people in and around Kano city, the

area’s economic density (GDP per square
kilometer) was 35 times that of Nigeria
in 1990. The capacity of the tanneries in
and around the city even makes it worthwhile to illegally import live animals—the
most important intermediate input—
from neighboring countries. But Kano is
neither large enough, nor rich enough,
to consume more than a little of what is
produced. The goods must be exported
to people willing to pay enough to make
production worthwhile.
Distance. Wealthy Europeans want
goods made with “Morocco leather,” a
lot of which comes from Kano. To get to
Europe, Kano’s bulky exports must travel
through Lagos, which along highways
and railways is about 1,000 kilometers
away. It might as well be 4,000 kilometers. A railway goes to Lagos through
the cities of Kaduna and Ibadan, but it is
narrow gauge and poorly maintained.
Most commerce is by road, obstructed by
roadblocks and piracy. Shipping companies charge more than $1,200 for a 30-ton
trailer from Kano to Lagos. Once the
goods get to Lagos, there are port fees,
pilferage, and delays. It takes 26 days to
get the goods onto a ship. The economic
distance from Kano to Lagos, measured
as money, is several times the Euclidean
(straight-line) 829 kilometers.

prematurely will jeopardize progress. Two
centuries of economic development show
that spatial disparities in income and production are inevitable. A generation of economic research confirms this: there is no
good reason to expect economic growth to
spread smoothly across space. The experience of successful developers shows that
production becomes more concentrated
spatially. The most successful nations also
institute policies that make basic living
standards more uniform across space. Economic production concentrates, while living standards converge.
Part one of the Report describes the
geographic transformations that are necessary for development. Part two analyzes the
drivers of these changes and identifies the
markets that deliver both concentration and

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 6

Division. But the journey is not yet
complete. The goods must surmount
the division caused by differences in
currencies and conventions between
Nigeria and Europe. Between December
2007 and March 2008, Nigeria’s currency
depreciated from 170 naira to €1 to
180 naira, but appreciated from 246 naira
to the British pound in November 2007
to 235 naira in March 2008. Buyers and
sellers of leather goods have to contend
with these fluctuations. They must also
deal with two sets of laws and customs.
The United Kingdom has 30 procedures
for enforcing a contract, Nigeria 39. These
divisions multiply the costs of doing
business. Few cargo ships make landfall
in Lagos, so it costs much more to transport goods from Lagos than from busier
places such as Shanghai. It costs less than
$400 to ship a container to the United
Kingdom from China, more than $1,000
from Nigeria.
Low local density, costly internal distances, and international divisions conspire
against Kano. Making matters more difficult
are religious and other divisions within
Nigeria.

Sanni, and Akoroda, (FAO 2004); Government of Nigeria 2003.

convergence. Part three proposes the principle of economic integration—between
places that producers prefer and places
where people live—to guide policy making.
Using this principle, it reframes the debates
on urbanization, territorial development,
and international integration, calling for a
change in orientation of policies away from
geographic targeting toward integration.
By using a well-calibrated blend of institutions, infrastructure, and interventions,
today’s developers can reshape their economic geography. When they do this well,
they will experience unbalanced growth
and inclusive development.

The three dimensions of development

Overview

three dimensions—density, distance, and
division. These three words are not just metaphors for the policy challenges just outlined.
They conform closely to the more technical
notion of “market access” (see box 2). And
they represent the dimensions of economic
geography that have to be reshaped if the
development challenges are to be met.
Understanding the transformations
along the dimensions of density, distance,
and division helps to identify the main
market forces and the appropriate policy
responses at each of the three geographic
scales—local, national, and international
(see table 1).

•

•

Density is the most important dimension
locally. Distances are short, and cultural
and political divisions are few and shallow. The policy challenge is getting density right—harnessing market forces to
encourage concentration and promote
convergence in living standards between
villages and towns and cities. But distance can be important as rapid urbanization leads to congestion, and divisions
within cities can be manifest in slums
and ghettos.
Distance to density is the most important dimension at the national geographic scale. Distance between areas
where economic activity is concentrated
and areas that lag is the main dimension.
The policy challenge is helping fi rms

and workers reduce their distance from
density. The main mechanisms are the
mobility of labor and the reduction of
transport costs through infrastructure
investments. Divisions within countries—differences in language, currency,
and culture—tend to be small, though
large countries such as India and Nigeria
may be geographically divided because
of religion, ethnicity, or language.
Division is the most important dimension internationally. But distance and
density are also relevant. Economic production is concentrated in a few world
regions—North America, Northeast
Asia, and Western Europe—that are
also the most integrated. Other regions,
by contrast, are divided. While distance matters at the international level,
for access to world markets, divisions
associated with the impermeability of
borders and differences in currencies
and regulations are a more serious barrier than distance. Having a large and
dynamic economy within the neighborhood can help smaller countries,
especially in regions distant from world
markets. For economies in other regions
such as Central Africa and Central Asia,
international integration is hardest.

But the potential problem at each of
these geographic scales is the same—people
in one place, production in another. Places

attract production and people at different
speeds, and these differences determine
geographic disparities in income. Across
provinces, nations, and the world, development comes in waves and leaves behind a
bumpy economic landscape—prosperity in
some places, poverty in others.

The world is not flat
Development is neither smooth nor linear—at any geographic scale. Growth
comes earlier to some places than to others.
Geographic differences in living standards
diverge before converging, faster at the local
scale and slower as geography exercises its
influence. These are the stylized facts, based
on the experiences of successful developers
over the last two centuries.

Economic production becomes
more concentrated
As countries develop, people and economic
activities become more concentrated. But
the speed varies, depending on the spatial
scale—economic forces do not operate in
a geographic vacuum. The concentration
of people and production is fastest locally,
slowest internationally.

•

•

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 8

Concentration is fastest locally. Economic
concentration at the local scale is most
conveniently measured by the rate of
urbanization—the growth of economic
and population density in towns and cities. A large part of this geographic transformation has been completed when
countries reach per capita incomes of
about $3,500, roughly the threshold for
crossing into upper-middle incomes. The
speed of this transformation is no different from what was seen in today’s developed countries when they transformed.
The implication is that all nations must
manage a rapid growth of cities when
they still have low incomes and nascent
institutions.
Concentration is steadier nationally.
Here, it can best be measured by area
development indicators—the accumulation of production and people in leading
areas. A large part of this transformation generally is completed when countries reach per capita incomes of about

•

$10,000–$11,000, about the threshold for
crossing into high incomes. This is the
experience of successful developers. The
implication is that developing countries
should expect rising subnational disparities in income and production when they
still have underdeveloped infrastructure
and institutions.
Concentration is slowest internationally, and it continues longer. Production
and wealth continue to concentrate in
countries beyond per capita incomes of
$25,000, the upper reaches of the international income distribution. Neighborhoods of nations seem to grow or stagnate
together—nearness to prosperity helps,
while nearness to poor nations hurts. The
implication is that growth strategies for
later developers are not the same as the
strategies that worked for those who have
already grown to high-income levels; for
today’s developing countries, economic
integration with the rest of the world—
neighbors and distant countries—is even
more essential.

Local concentration (in towns and cities) happens quickly. Consider first the rising
concentration of people in towns and cities.
As countries develop, the economic density
in some places increases as more people move
to live in or near towns and cities (see figure
1, panel a). The urban share of the population
rises sharply—from about 10 percent to 50
percent—as countries grow from low income
to lower-middle incomes of about $3,500.
(It is difficult to make international comparisons because countries define “urban”
differently.3) Between 2000 and 2005, the
average urban population growth for lowincome countries was 3 percent a year, more
than twice the rate for middle-income countries and more than three times the rate for
high-income countries. Sometimes, this can
mean rapid growth of a single city, such as
Bangkok, Thailand, producing even greater
concentration.
The share of urban residents in total
household consumption rises too. Urbanites
in Malawi, Jordan, and Panama—countries
with per capita GDPs of about $160, $1,600,
and $5,600 respectively—account for 36, 63,
and 80 percent of aggregate consumption.

Overview

These spatial transformations are
closely related to the sectoral transformation of countries from agrarian to
industrial and then, in a postindustrial
economy, to services. Today’s high-income countries experienced a similar
rush to urbanize as they industrialized
(see chapter 1). All the evidence indicates
that the shift from farming to industry is
helped, not hurt, by healthy agriculture,
which helps towns and cities prosper.4
People move to make their own lives better. But when agriculture is doing well,
migration makes not just them better off,
but also the villages they leave and the
cities in which they settle.
National concentration (in leading
areas) continues for longer. What is true of
cities is also true of areas within countries,
but at a slower speed. With development,
people and production become concentrated in some parts of countries, called
“leading” areas. Economic density grows in
these parts—Marmara in Turkey, for example—while incomes in places economically
distant—such as southeastern Anatolia in
the east—can lag far behind. This concentration is hard to quantify, but it appears to
slow or stop at per capita incomes between
$10,000 and $15,000 (see figure 1, panel b).
Initially, the concentration increases
rapidly. The share of total consumption of
the leading areas in countries with incomes
ranging between $500 and $7,500—Tajikistan, Mongolia, El Salvador, and Argentina—increases from 30 percent to 65
percent. Comparing GDP concentrations
in countries with the same land area— Lao
PDR, Ghana, Poland, and Norway—but
with incomes from $600 to $27,000 shows
concentration rising as incomes increase.
This is nothing new. Production in
today’s developed economies grew more
concentrated until they reached high
incomes. Concentration in France’s leading
area quadrupled between 1800 and 1960,
and French incomes grew from $1,000 to
$6,000. But at some point, nations continue
to grow wealthier but not more concentrated—about when they enter the ranks of
high-income countries. There are no reasons to expect greatly different patterns
today (see chapter 2).

International concentration (in some
world regions and leading countries) continues for a while. A similar concentration
of economic mass has occurred internationally. Today, a quarter of the world’s GDP
can fit into an area the size of Cameroon,
and a half into one the size of Algeria. In
1980 the shares of the EU15, North America, and East Asia added up to 70 percent;
in 2000 the sum was 83 percent.5 Within
these regions, economic activity became
more concentrated in a few countries over
time before it became more dispersed. The
shares of France, Germany, and the United
Kingdom in the EU15 regional GDP rose to
about two-thirds by 1940, before falling to
about half today. In East Asia, the share of
Japan in the region’s GDP rose to 83 percent
in 1975 and then fell to 62 percent by 2000.
There is no reason to expect that, when
they prosper, other parts of the world will not
experience the same patterns—a rising concentration in some countries, before overflowing to their neighbors (see chapter 3).

Living standards diverge before
converging
As incomes increase, living standards converge between places where economic mass
has concentrated and where it has not, but
not before diverging.

Essential household consumption converges
soonest. Rural-urban gaps in essential
household consumption diminish quite
rapidly. Even for countries that have urban
shares of about 50 to 60 percent, these differences can be small. Area differences in
poverty rates are more persistent, international differences even more so. But as
the world has developed, these gaps have
diminished at all geographic scales.
Access to basic public services converges
next. Rural-urban gaps in basic education, health, drinking water, and sanitation persist until countries reach
upper-middle incomes. But within-city
disparities in these services—most visible as slums—persist well past high levels of urbanization and upper-middle
incomes.
Wages and incomes converge last. Indeed,
wages and incomes diverge between lag-

ging and leading areas of a country as it
grows through low and lower-middle
incomes, the same range of per capita
incomes needed for territorial concentration to increase. And global divergence
in wages and wealth appears to go on
for much longer. East Asia saw per capita
incomes diverge between 1950 and 1970
as Japan pulled ahead. Then, Japan’s prosperity spilled over into the neighborhood,
and incomes converged as countries in
the region that integrated internationally
prospered. Among the countries of West
Asia, by contrast, there was no divergence
in incomes—nor was there rapid growth.
Convergence in living standards, like concentration of economic activity, takes place
faster at the local geographic scale and slowest at the international. But this happens only
in prosperous neighborhoods. Even in such
places, some measures of living standards
(such as per capita consumption, income,
or earnings) take a long time to converge,
sometimes even with an initial divergence
(see figure 2). For others, such as education
and health indicators, it can be quicker.
Locally, convergence in basic living standards sets in early. Urban-to-rural gaps in
consumption levels rise until countries reach
upper-middle-income levels (see figure 2).
But they fall soon after, and become small
even before they get to high-income levels of
around $10,000 per capita. Access to water
and sanitation in urban areas is more than
25 percent higher in urban areas for the less
urbanized countries. For countries with
urbanization rates of about 50 percent, such
as Algeria, Colombia, and South Africa, the
disparity in access is about 15 percent. For
such countries as Brazil, Chile, Gabon, and
Jordan, the disparity is less than 10 percent.
This pattern is also seen within countries.
Provinces that are more prosperous and
urbanized have smaller rural-urban gaps in
living standards. This is true even in countries at low levels of income, such as China,
India, and the Philippines. But within highly
urbanized areas, gaps in basic living standards such as sanitation and schools tend to
persist. Despite the best efforts of governments, for example, slums mark the urban
landscape in countries well after they reach

Overview

high-income levels. It is common for onethird of a developing city’s population to live
in slums.
Nationally, divergence in living standards happens quickly, but convergence
is slower. At early levels of income, provincial or interarea disparities in basic living
standards can be small. But they increase
quickly as countries grow. In low-income
Cambodia, for example, the gap between
leading and lagging areas in consumption
of otherwise-similar households is almost
90 percent. In middle-income Argentina,
the gap is 50 percent; but in contemporary
Canada, it is just 20 percent. In the rapidly
growing East Asian and Eastern European
countries, for example, these gaps have
increased rapidly.
A few countries such as Chile have been
exceptions. Between 1960 and 2000, it
experienced geographic convergence while
its GDP per capita more than doubled to
about $10,500. In Colombia, the ratio of
GDP of leading Bogotá to lagging Choco
fell from 10 to 3 between 1950 and 1990.
Less exceptional is convergence in poverty,
basic health, nutrition, and education levels between areas within countries. Fastgrowing countries everywhere have been
able to quickly translate economic progress
into spatial equity in these more basic living standards.
Internationally, divergence in incomes
continues a while, and convergence
is slowest. Global GDP per capita has
increased almost tenfold since 1820. Life
expectancy has doubled. Literacy rates have
increased from less than 20 to more than
80 percent. But these gains have not been
shared equally. Europe and its offshoots—
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the
United States—and more lately Japan and
its neighbors have seen enormous increases
in income and living standards.
For incomes, the convergence has happened only in the fastest-growing regions
of the world. The pattern has been uneven
within these countries—a few countries
lead, resulting in divergence within the
neighborhood, and then growth appears
to spill over into their neighbors. In other
regions such as Western Asia, there is
no divergence—cold comfort because

America—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and
Uruguay—with Italy, Portugal, and Spain
in southern Europe. Between 1950 and
2006, convergence within southern Europe
took place at 1 percent per year, but in South
America at just 0.3 percent.
In contrast to incomes, global inequality in access to basic living standards—life
expectancy and education—has been falling since 1930. These improvements have
picked up pace since 1960 and have been
shared across all regions.

The world is different today,
but the past provides useful lessons
The general patterns of concentration and
convergence are likely to remain the same
for today’s developing countries as they
were for early developers. But there are
some differences because of reasons that
are technological and political.
Bigger cities. Thanks to better medicine
and transport, the world is now more populated and cities are much larger. Between
1985 and 2005, the urban population in
developing countries grew by more than
8.3 million a year, almost three times the
annual increase of 3 million for today’s
high-income countries between 1880 and
1900, when their incomes were comparable.
If China and India are excluded, though,
the annual increase is less than 4.5 million,
about 50 percent more than a century ago.
The big difference is that the world’s largest cities are today much larger. London
had fewer than 7 million people in 1900;
the largest city among low-income countries today (Mumbai) is three times that
size. So is Mexico City, the largest city in
middle-income countries. The average size
of the world’s largest 100 cities has grown
to almost 10 times their size in 1900 (see
figure 3, panel a), and almost two-thirds of
these cities are in developing countries.
Wider markets. Because of advances in
communications and transport technology, the notion of markets is more global.
Global trade as a share of production is now
more than 25 percent, almost five times
more than in 1900 (see figure 3, panel b).
The openness to trade and capital flows
that makes markets more global also makes
subnational disparities in income larger

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 12

and persist for longer in today’s developing countries. Not all parts of a country
are suited for accessing world markets, and
coastal and economically dense places do
better. China’s GDP per capita in 2007 was
the same as that of Britain in 1911. Shanghai, China’s leading area, today has a GDP
per capita the same as Britain in 1988, while
lagging Guizhou is closer to Britain in 1930.
China’s size, the openness of coastal China
to world trade, and Shanghai’s location are
the reasons.
More borders. While markets are becoming more international because of better
transport and communications, the world
has become more politically fragmented.
In 1900 there were about 100 international
borders (see figure 3, panel c). Today, there
are more than 600, as nations in Asia and
Africa gained independence from European colonizers, and the Soviet Union and
other communist countries broke up into
smaller nations. The fragmentation of the
world into more nations means smaller
domestic markets. But at the same time, the
potential for accessing foreign markets has
been growing. In any case, thinner borders
between countries now bring greater payoffs for producers and workers.
Do such differences in technology mean
that the past provides no lessons? Are cities in developing countries too large, and
would these countries be better off if
urbanization were slowed? Should today’s
developing countries be more concerned
about regional disparities in production
and income than developed countries were
at a comparable stage of development? Is it
easier today for all developing countries to
access global markets and offset the disadvantages associated with greater fragmentation? This Report shows why the answer to
all these questions is no.

Markets shape the economic
landscape
Rising densities of human settlements,
migrations of workers and entrepreneurs to
shorten the distance to markets, and lower
divisions caused by differences in currencies and conventions between countries are
central to successful economic development. The spatial transformations along

changing the economic landscape of today’s

ways similar in scope and speed. Growing

these three dimensions—density, distance,
and division—have been most noticeable
in Japan, North America, and Western
Europe. Fast and frequent movements of
people and products have helped North
America, Western Europe, and Northeast
Asia account for about three-fourths of
global production with less than a sixth of
the world’s people.
The same market forces of agglomeration, migration, and specialization are

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 13

A trip on National Highway 321 east from
Chengdu in Sichuan province to Shenzhen
in Guangdong is a journey through economic development. Migrating workers
who travel these highways often leave their
families behind. But they also help their
families escape poverty and propel China
through the ranks of middle-income countries. As they travel eastward, they leave
an agrarian realm in which they receive
few benefits from working in proximity
to others. Instead, they enter the realm of
“agglomeration economies,” in which being
near other people produces huge benefits.
Shenzhen attracts young workers—90
percent of its 8 million residents are of
working age. It specializes in electronic
goods. But it makes them in enormous
quantities. In 2006 its exports exceeded
India’s, making its seaport the fourth busiest in the world. Propelled by the forces of
agglomeration, migration, and specialization, and helped by its nearness to Hong
Kong, China, Shenzhen has grown the fastest of all cities in China since 1979, when it
was designated a special economic zone.
This story is being replayed in India. In
1990 Sriperumbudur was known mostly as
the place where Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. In 2006 his widow,
Sonia Gandhi, watched as Nokia’s telephone plant churned out its 20-millionth
handset.6 The plant had begun production just earlier that year. With neither
Shenzhen’s favored administrative status
nor its infrastructure, Sriperumbudur
may be on its way to becoming a national,
perhaps even regional, hub for electronic
goods. The key is the town’s proximity to
Chennai, just as Shenzhen’s proximity to
Hong Kong, China, was instrumental in
its growth.

In 1965, when independence was thrust
on Singapore, it was not near any prosperous or peaceful place. Instead, it lay between
Malaysia and Indonesia, two poor countries
that had been ravaged by war between colonizers. Three-quarters of Singapore’s population lived in tenements. By 1980 it had
industrialized, specializing in electronics,
much as Shenzhen is doing now. By 1986 it
was the world’s busiest container port and
Southeast Asia’s fi nancial hub. Along the
way, by instituting land markets, building
efficient transport infrastructure, and intervening to improve housing, it cleaned up its
slums. Prosperity spilled over into neighboring Malaysia. Malaysia’s manufacturing-led
prosperity in turn helped more than 2 million Indonesians who streamed in to fill jobs
in construction and services. Singapore’s
businessmen jet around Asia, fueling growth
in places farther than Shenzhen and Sriperumbudur. The “little red dot” on a map—as
reportedly derided by a neighboring president7—has transformed itself, integrated
its neighborhood, and overtaken Britain, its
former colonizer (see map 2).
Singapore, Shenzhen, and Sriperumbudur show how scale economies in production, movements of labor and capital,
and falling transport costs interact to produce rapid economic growth in cities and
countries both large and small. These are
the engine of any economy, with a role so
fundamental in prosperity and poverty
reduction that they are the subject of the

Map 2

first three chapters of the most influential
economics text ever written, Adam Smith’s
The Wealth of Nations.
The economies of scale emphasized by
Smith can be categorized into three types—
those exclusive to fi rms, those shared by
fi rms in the same industry and location,
and those more generally available to producers in a larger urban area.

With fewer than 17,000 people, Sriperumbudur was large enough for Hyundai to set up a big plant there in 1999.
By 2006 the town had helped Hyundai
produce its millionth automobile. Basic
education and health services, proximity
to a port, and basic infrastructure were
all it needed to facilitate plant-level scale
economies. The evidence is that internal
scale economies are high in such heavy
industries as shipbuilding, and low in
such light industries as garments. The
town has enough workers to enable
matching workers and jobs in big plants.
So towns like Sriperumbudur are large
enough to facilitate internal economies.
Shenzhen Special Economic Region—
with an area of just 300 square kilometers
but a population of almost 3 million—is
home to a bustling electronics industry.
With a ready supply of skilled and semiskilled young workers, the area is investing in better education and research
facilities to ensure that the city supplies
what the industry needs. Its port ships in
intermediate inputs and ships out fi nal
products. It shares expensive facilities,
such as top-notch container ports and
convention centers, and matches workers to the growing number of jobs as
fi rms rapidly expand their operations.
Proximity to Hong Kong, China, provides access to finance, though Shenzhen
is home to a rapidly expanding financial
sector. And competition for customers
among the multiple suppliers of inputs
produces cost savings. The area excels in
providing, in economic jargon, localization economies.
Singapore has passed through these
stages and is now one of the world’s
top centers of commerce. By providing
a stable economic environment, excel-

lent transport links, livability, and efficient fi nance, it provides services to the
entire Asia-Pacific region. These services are used by a wide range of industries, from shipping to manufacturing,
to education, and to fi nance, insurance,
and real estate. They thrive on economic density. With fewer than 5 million people packed into less than 700
square kilometers of space, Singapore
is the world’s most densely populated
country. In 2006 its exports of $300
billion approached those of the Russian
Federation, which has more than 16
million square kilometers. Singapore’s
diversity facilitates sharing, matching,
and learning, providing what economists call urbanization economies.
In most countries, such towns and cities coexist. Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state has
about 14.5 million people. Volta Redonda,
not too far from Rio city, originally supplied
goods and services just to meet the needs of
CSN, the largest steel plant in Latin America. Duque de Caixas, about 15 kilometers
from Rio, meets the needs of an industry
producing petrochemicals. And the diversified Rio de Janeiro metropolis, with about
6 million people, supplies financial services
to settlements that surround it. And with
other metropolises like São Paulo, Rio connects Brazil to the rest of Latin America and
the world. The pattern is so familiar that it
is almost a law of urban economics.
The functions and fortunes of settlements are linked. Industrialized places are
different from their agrarian predecessors
not just because they are more concentrated
but also because they are more specialized.
The largest cities may be well suited for
startup enterprises; the smaller ones may be
better suited for those more established. In
agriculture, sowing and reaping must happen in the same place. Not so for industry
and business services. Falling transport and
communications costs allow firms to spatially separate sowing and reaping. Products may be designed and fi nanced in large
cities—and produced in small towns.
As firms adjust to changing market conditions, places have to perform different
functions or risk decay. The most immobile

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 15

15

of all inputs to production—land—must
become mobile between uses. Access to
oceans and rivers might be the reason a
place is settled, but the nimbleness of its
land markets will largely determine how
much it will grow. Governments may not be
good at picking places that will prosper. But
how well they institute regulations, build
infrastructure, and intervene to make land
use efficient will decide the pace of prosperity for the entire neighborhood.
Depending on what type of agglomeration economies they deliver, places can be
large or small. Function is far more important than size. But locating farther away
from economic density generally reduces
productivity. Doubling this distance in
Brazil apparently reduces productivity by
15 percent and profits by 6 percent. Better
infrastructure reduces economic distance.
But in a developing country, the most natural way for workers and entrepreneurs to
close this distance is to move closer.

Migrating to profit from proximity
Agglomeration economies attract people
and fi nance. Today, capital tends to move
quickly over long distances to exploit
opportunities for profit. People also move,
but they move more quickly to nearby
agglomerations than to those far away.
Once plants and people come to a place,
others follow.

•

•

Locally, the move toward density is quick
in fast-growing economies, manifest
in a rapid rural-urban migration that
accompanies the shift from agriculture to
industry. As the Republic of Korea grew
between 1970 and 1995, the urban share
of population quadrupled to 82 percent,
with migration accounting for more than
half the increase in the 1960s and 1970s.
Nationally, workers move to reduce distance to markets in parts that are prospering. About 3 million people moved
in the second half of the 1990s from
the lagging Indian states of Bihar and
Uttar Pradesh to leading Maharashtra
and prosperous Punjab (see map 5). In
Vietnam, a much smaller country, more
than 4 million people migrated internally during the same period.

Internationally, regional migration is
a big part of labor mobility. Migration
among neighbors is considerable. Côte
d’Ivoire, India, and the Islamic Republic
of Iran have been among the top destinations for their neighbors. Germany,
Italy, and the United Kingdom still rank

among the top 10 sending countries. But
interregional migration is sluggish. Fewer
than 200 million of the world’s 6.7 billion
people live outside their region of birth.
And just 2 million people move from
poorer countries to the developed every
year, half of them to the United States.

Overview

This sum is not likely to increase, even
though the gains from greater migration
from developing to developed countries are
considerable.8 International migration has
been high in the past: fully 20 percent of
Europeans emigrated to new lands in the
Americas, Australia, and South Africa.
Today, these movements have slowed. Just
500,000 Chinese emigrated abroad in 2005.
But internal migration has picked up in the
developing world. More than 150 million
people moved internally in China despite
restrictions (see map 3). In Brazil’s highgrowth years during the 1960s and 1970s,
almost 40 million people left the countryside for cities; even today, young workers migrate in large numbers (see map 4).
Vigorous internal migration is not new.
Between 1820 and 2000 per capita incomes
in the United States multiplied 25-fold,
and Americans earned the reputation of
being among the most footloose of people.
In Japan internal migration peaked in the
1960s, as it grew to become the world’s
second-largest economy.
Despite aggressive area development
policies, 1.7 million people—more women
than men—have left East Germany for
the West, helping to make incomes more
equal. Since the transition to market
economies, fi rms and people have picked
places better suited for production. More
than a million people—about 12 percent of

residents—have left Siberia and the Russian
North and Far East for the western parts of
Russia.
West Africa has sustained regional labor
mobility through institutional cooperation. But independent Africa is generally
less integrated. Africans—especially the
most skilled—have been leaving the continent, seeking and getting higher rewards in
the North. Other parts of the world show
how to deal with this brain drain. Educated
workers will be pulled toward places where
other skilled people agglomerate. This is
beneficial for both places. But when people
are pushed out by the lack of security or
basic services, migration is beneficial for
the migrant but not always for the nation.
Pull migration is better than push, but both
are hard to stop or slow. Policy makers are
realizing that the challenge is not how to
keep people from moving, but how to keep
them from moving for the wrong reasons.
China illustrates the benefits. Except for
a brief period during the Cultural Revolution, China has treated its diaspora well,
according them both rights and respect.9
Internally, its policies have gone back and
forth, but now they are shifting from trying
to discourage people from moving to delivering basic services to people wherever they
live. The policies are paying dividends. As
Chinese migrants are moving to the coast
by the million, many of the 57 million
overseas Chinese are bringing finance and
expertise back to some of the same places.
Internal and international migrants are
coming together in a way that is not accidental. The willingness of the Chinese to
move—leaving the country for other parts
of the world to escape war and squalor in the
first part of the twentieth century and then
bringing finance and know-how to coastal
China during the last quarter—promises
to bring to southeast China a “reversal of
fortune” rivaling the U.S. Northeast (see
“Geography in Motion: Overcoming Distance in North America”).
Countries do not prosper without
mobile people. Indeed, the ability of people
to move seems to be a good gauge of their
economic potential, and the willingness to
migrate appears to be a measure of their
desire for advancement. Governments

should facilitate labor mobility. For
decades since independence, India treated
its 40 million emigrants as “not required
Indians.” Encouraged by a change in attitude since the 1990s, expatriate Indians are
pulling distant places like Bangalore and
Hyderabad closer to world markets, just as
the overseas Chinese did for Shanghai and
Guangzhou more than a decade earlier.
Falling costs of transport and communications have helped greatly.

Specializing and trading as transport
costs fall
Transport and communication costs have
indeed fallen rapidly over the last century,
especially in the last 50 years. Since the
1970s, railroad freight costs are down by
half. Road transport costs, despite higher
energy and wage costs, are down by about
40 percent. For worldwide air freight, the
price has fallen to about 6 percent of its 1955
level. The price for tramp shipping services
is half that in 1960. A three-minute phone
call from New York to London was almost
$300 in 1931. Today, the same call can be
made for just a few cents.
With falling domestic transport costs,
economic production should have become
more evenly spread within countries. With
lower costs of transporting and communicating internationally, countries should
have traded more with distant partners.
What happened was the opposite. Falling
transport costs have coincided with greater
economic concentration within countries.
And while countries now trade more with
everyone—exports as a share of world production quadrupled to 25 percent over the
last three decades—trade with neighbors
became even more important.
Why did this happen? The answer lies in
the growing importance of scale economies
in production and transport (see chapter
6). As transport costs have fallen, they have
allowed greater specialization and radically
altered the location of firms and the nature
of trade. With high transport costs, fi rms
had to be near consumers. But as transport
costs fall, they can avail of internal, local,
and urban economies of scale, and transport the product to consumers. Internationally, the same thing. With high transport

costs, England imported only what it could
not grow or produce at reasonable cost—
spices from India and beef from Argentina
in exchange for British textiles and china.
As transport costs fell, it imported more
spices and beef. But it also traded more with
France and Germany—Scotch whisky for
French wine, English ale for German beer.
Trade to fulfi ll basic needs was joined and
soon overtaken by trade to satisfy a variety
of wants.
Falling costs of transportation and communication have made the world smaller.
But they have also made economic activity
more geographically concentrated.

•

•

•

Locally, with falling costs of commuting and a greater potential for exploiting scale economies, towns and cities can
grow bigger and denser.
Nationally, as leading and lagging areas
within countries are connected through
better modes of transport, production
is more concentrated in the more economically dense areas to take advantage
of agglomeration economies.
Internationally, countries that have
lowered the costs of transport more
have benefited most from greater trade.
Greater specialization has made these
countries more competitive still, concentrating trade and wealth in a few
parts of the world.

Scale economies are evident in the transport sector, too. More trade means lower
costs of transportation, which in turn
means more trade. This is especially true
for intraindustry trade, which has been the
most rapidly growing part of international
trade during the last half-century. Since
1960 the share of intraindustry trade in the
world’s total has doubled from 27 percent
to 54 percent. Within-region intraindustry
trade is low in most regions, and high in a
few. It is close to zero for Central Africa,
Central Asia, East Africa, Northern Africa,
South Asia, and Southern Africa. It is highest for Australia, East Asia, New Zealand,
North America, and Western Europe (see
figure 4).
Regional cooperation has advanced
much faster and further in these parts of the

world, explaining why the friction of borders on trade has fallen. Aided by a deepening integration, the intraregional share
of trade in the EU has risen above 60 percent (see “Geography in Motion: Overcoming Division in Western Europe”). In East
Asia, the fastest-growing region, the share of
regional trade is now more than 55 percent
(see “Geography in Motion: Distance and
Division in East Asia”).
Development in a world of greater specialization and concentration is even more
challenging. Developing countries have
higher transport costs and small markets,
which do not support specialization. But
several countries—mainly in East Asia—
have shown that these markets are accessible for low-income countries. The answer
lies in the fastest-growing component of
intraindustry trade: trade in “intermediate
inputs” of production (see box 3).
In agriculture, industry, and services,
the potential for fragmenting production
is almost without limit. Thailand may not
be able to make a television set better than
Japan, but it could make parts of televisions

est increase is in food and live animals.
Consumers like variety for farm produce,
and that means profit in trade between
two countries that raise similar food and
animals (see figure at left).
But the largest rise is for intermediate
inputs—the produced means of production. Marginal intraindustry trade—a
reliable measure of change—is highest
in intermediate inputs. This is not just for
manufacturing. Agriculture needs inputs,
too. And falling communications costs
have resulted in greater fragmentation
of services into “components,” supplied
to final consumers from different parts of
the world.
Trade in intermediate goods is more
sensitive to transport costs than is trade
in final goods. Consider the following
illustration: if intermediate inputs are
two-thirds of the value added for a good,
a 5-percent increase in transport costs
can mean the equivalent of a 50-percent
tax. Little wonder that intermediate
goods trade has increased fastest in parts
of the world that have reduced trade and
transport costs the most.

equally well and much cheaper. Anchored
by China and Japan, countries in East Asia
have developed production networks that
trade intermediate goods back and forth.
By specializing in a small part of the production chain, they have broken into this
most lucrative and fastest-growing component of trade in manufactures.
Countries in other regions can also
benefit from the growing trade in intermediate goods. The key for most is making a concerted effort to lower the costs of
transport. This means more concentration within developing countries, but—by
allowing them to specialize at earlier stages
of development and exploit economies of
scale—it will help them converge to the
incomes and living standards in the developed world. Over the last two decades,
such interactions between scale economies, mobility of capital and labor, and

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 20

transport costs have occupied the interest
of researchers (see box 4).
Their insights should change what to
expect from the markets. They should also
inform what governments can do to promote the geographic transformations necessary for development.

Putting development in place
Prosperity will not come to every place at
once, but no place should remain mired in
poverty. With good policies, the concentration of economic activity and the convergence of living standards can happen
together. The challenge for governments is
to allow—even encourage—“unbalanced”
economic growth, and yet ensure inclusive
development. They can do this through
economic integration—by bringing lagging and leading places closer in economic
terms.

New insights from a generation of analysis

Researchers have been taking a fresh
look at industrial organization, economic growth, international trade, and
economic geography, having incorporated the effects of scale economies in
production. The results can be surprising for those schooled in conventional
economic analysis. Here are some of the
new insights:
Plants have to be big to exploit economies of scale, but places do not have
to be big to generate them. Increasing
returns to scale arise because of fixed
costs of production (internal to a firm)
and proximity to workers, customers,
and people with new ideas (external to a
firm, even an industry). The size of settlements matters less than their function.
The reason: with reasonable transport
costs, towns can be large enough to
facilitate internal scale economies. Medium-size cities are often large enough for
“localization” economies that come from

thick input markets, but not for “urbanization” economies—especially those
involving knowledge spillovers—generated mainly by large cities (see chapter 4).
The implication: policy makers should
focus on the functions of cities.
Human capital moves to where it is
abundant, not scant. Conventional economic analysis implies that people should
move to where their skills are scant. But
the opposite seems to happen: educated
migrants seek places where many others
have similar skills. Among the 100 largest
metropolitan areas in the United States,
the 25 cities with the highest share of
college graduates in 1990 had, by 2000,
attracted graduates at twice the rate of the
other 75.
The reason: educated workers gain
from proximity to others (see chapter 5).
The implication: policies should not
fight the market force that pulls skilled
people together.

This integration can best be done by
unleashing the market forces of agglomeration, migration, and specialization, not
by fighting or opposing them. How well
markets and governments work together
determines the speed and sustainability of
geographic transformations. Look at what
is happening in Bogotá, Turkey, and West
Africa:

•

Bogotá has almost 7 million citizens, but
migration from rural Colombia continues. A third of its population growth is
due to rural migrants, who mostly settle
in poor, crowded neighborhoods as the
city grows denser. Since 2000 a new public
transportation system, the TransMilenio,
has eased congestion, now carrying a
million passengers a month. For the poor
neighborhoods especially, it has reduced
the distance to economic opportunities.
But many people still live in slums, and
crime and violence are getting worse.
A municipal initiative has addressed
these social divisions since 2003, helping
almost a million people integrate into the
city and change their neighborhoods.

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 21

•

•

Falling transport costs increase trade
more with neighboring, not distant,
countries. With a decline in transport costs,
countries should trade more with countries
that are farther away. But trade has become
more localized than globalized. Countries
trade more with countries that are similar,
because increasingly the basis of trade is
the exploitation of economies of scale, not
the differences in natural endowments.
The reason: falling transport costs make
specialization possible (see chapter 6).
The implication: falling transport costs
change the composition of international
trade and make it even more sensitive to
such costs. Policies to reduce trade and
transport costs should be a big part of
growth strategies for late developers.
Recognizing scale economies and their
interaction with the mobility of people and
products implies changing long-held views
about what is needed for economic growth.
Source: WDR 2009 team.

Turkey is trying to change neighborhoods too, in a different way. The
country of 70 million has been looking
toward integration with the EU. Because
of higher agglomeration economies and
lower transport costs, areas near Istanbul
and Izmir may be better suited for integrating with Europe. The more distant
areas of eastern and southeastern Anatolia and the Black Sea have 40 percent of
the land but less than 20 percent of the
national product, with a GDP per capita
about half that of the western areas. The
disparities persist despite government
efforts to spread economic mass toward
the east. Meanwhile, public investments
in social services help lagging areas,
while fiscal incentives for firms to locate
in those areas seem ineffective.10
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has a protocol that
allows free movement of its 250 million
people between member states. This
has helped the neighborhood maintain
regional labor mobility at preindependence levels, even as it fell in East and
Southern Africa. But trade is another

story. In the most dynamic parts of the
world, the exchange of similar goods and
services—intraindustry trade—has been
rising rapidly. But in West Africa, international borders are thickened by red tape
and illicit checkpoints, which divide the
region and thwart the efforts of ECOWAS
members to specialize and trade.
As the lens of economic geography is
widened, different movements, stresses,
and strains come into view.

•

•

•

Locally, in places like Bogotá, land must
accommodate more and more people.
If land markets work well, land will be
mobile between uses and allocated productively. The cities that do this best
will grow, and even more people will be
attracted to their economic density.
People and products move much faster
in and around Bogotá than they do in
Turkey. But even in Turkey, the western
areas will become more prosperous and
dense, if at a slower pace. Spatial disparities in incomes and poverty rates
between the west and the east will likely
rise and then diminish as people move
to take advantage of economic density. If
labor markets in Turkey are fluid, people will reduce their economic distance
to these agglomerations.
Internationally, these movements are
likely to be fewer and even slower. If
regional and global markets were integrated, countries in West Africa would
specialize in a few tasks and become
competitive in world markets. As divisions diminish, neighboring countries

Private motives are the main shapers
of the economic landscape, but it can be
reshaped by collective action, most potently
by governments. Seen through the lens of
economic geography, land use, labor mobility, and intermediate goods trade come into
focus (see table 2). Governments should pay
special attention to land, labor, and product
markets. When they do not work well, the
forces of agglomeration, migration, and
specialization weaken, and the economy
stagnates. When they do, land, labor, and
input markets bring the economic efficiency
that comes with geographic concentration,
and the equity associated with converging
living standards.

A rule of thumb for economic
integration
The concern of policy makers is that production will concentrate in some places,
people in others. Cities will have economic
density, and the countryside most of the
poor. Leading areas will have the economic
mass, while the poor are massed in lagging
areas. Some countries will have much of the
world’s wealth, others most of the world’s
poor. Even if this were temporary, it seems
unfair. But the disparities may be long lasting, destabilizing parts of a country, entire
nations, and even some world regions.
Governments have many reasons to
worry about disparities in welfare in and
among countries. They also have many policy instruments for promoting economic
integration to reduce those disparities.

trade similar goods and services, motivated more by the benefits of specialization and scale than by differences in
natural endowments. Trade can only
partially offset the immobility of land
and labor, but it will help convergence
when developing countries can tap into
the most rapidly growing component:
trade in intermediate goods.

for policies that are spatially blind in
their design and should be universal in
their coverage. Some of the main examples are regulations affecting land, labor,

services as education, health, and water
and sanitation financed through tax and
transfer mechanisms.
Infrastructure—shorthand for policies
and investments that are spatially connective. Examples include roads, railways,
airports, harbors, and communication
systems that facilitate the movement of
goods, services, people, and ideas locally,
nationally, and internationally.
Interventions—shorthand for the spatially targeted programs that often dominate the policy discussion. Examples
include slum clearance programs, fi scal incentives for manufacturing fi rms
offered by state governments, and preferential trade access for poor countries
in developed country markets.

Today, policy debates often begin and
end with discussions of spatially targeted
incentives. The debate on how to promote healthy urbanization is polarized
between those who emphasize villages,
where a majority of the world’s poor still
live, and those who believe the way out of
poverty lies in cities, where much of the
world’s wealth is generated. As urban poverty increases, the focus is shifting from
villages to slums. Motivated by withincountry geographic disparities in living
standards, the debate on territorial development is similarly fi xated on economic
growth in lagging areas. At the international level, preferential market access for

Table 3

the least developed countries can end up
dominating policy discussions.
This Report calls for a rebalancing of
these debates to include all the elements
of a successful approach to spatial integration—institutions, infrastructure, and
incentives. Using the fi ndings in part one
and the analysis of market forces in part
two, part three reframes these debates,
calling for a shift from spatial targeting to
spatial integration.
The world is complicated, and the problems of economic integration defy simple
solutions. But the principles need not be
complex. The bedrock of integration policies should be spatially blind institutions.
Where the integration challenge spans more
than one geographic dimension, institutions
must be augmented by public investments
in spatially connective infrastructure. Spatially targeted interventions are not always
necessary. But where the problem is low
economic density, long distances, and high
divisions, the response must be comprehensive, involving spatially blind, connective,
and targeted policies.
For each spatial dimension, an instrument of integration (see table 3). The rule
of thumb: “an I for a D.”

For a one-dimensional problem, the
mainstay of the policy response should

For a two-dimensional challenge, both
institutions and (spatially connective)
infrastructure are needed.

For a three-dimensional predicament,
all three instruments are needed—institutions, infrastructure, and (spatially
targeted) interventions.

The primary dimension at the local
geographic scale is density; nationally, it
is distance; internationally, division. At
each of these geographic scales, policies
designed without explicit consideration to
space should be seen as the primary instrument. In some places, these can be a large
part of integration policies. The task of
integration is relatively straightforward in
areas of incipient urbanization (as in lagging states in many low-income countries),
in countries with mobile labor and capital
(such as Chile), or in regions that are close
to world markets (such as North Africa).
In such places, the integration challenge
can be seen as one dimensional. Explicitly
spatial policies are not generally necessary.
Universal or spatially blind institutions—
made available to everyone regardless of
location—form both the bedrock and the
mainstay of an effective integration policy.
As the task becomes more complicated,
these institutions must be assisted by
infrastructure. Locally, rapid urbanization
can congest the area, increasing economic
distance and choking off agglomeration
economies. In places such as Mumbai,
whose population has doubled since the
1970s, rising congestion has to be met by
investments in transport infrastructure,
so that the benefits of density are shared
more widely. Nationally, changing economic and political fortunes can leave

behind a misplaced density of populations
in lagging areas, so that in some countries
(such as Brazil) lagging areas have higher
poverty rates and high population densities. Internationally, developing regions
are all deeply divided, but some also may
be distant from world markets. Even if
regional institutions take hold and make
South Asia a more integrated region, some
countries (such as Nepal) may need concerted policy action to improve the infrastructure to reach growing regional and
international markets. For places that
face two-dimensioned integration challenges, investments in infrastructure that
connects lagging to leading places and
aid market access should supplement the
institutions that bring people together.
The integration challenge is greatest where
adverse density, distance, and division combine to pose a “three-dimensional challenge.”
In highly urbanized areas (such as Bogotá),
the fear is that economic density and population density may not coincide. Within-city
divisions may prevent the integration of slums
and spawn problems of crime and grime. In
some countries (such as India), ethnic, religious, or linguistic divisions discourage the
poor in densely populated lagging areas from
seeking their fortunes elsewhere. And in the
most fragmented and remote regions (such as
Central Africa or Central Asia), a clustering
of small and poor nations can lead to spillovers of the wrong kind—disease, conflict,
or corruption.
Slums in large cities, densely populated
poor areas in divided nations, and the “bottom billion” countries—approximating the
three billions discussed at the beginning—
are the most difficult challenges for integration. The policy responses should not be
timid. But they should also be deliberate.

25

No country has grown to middle income
without industrializing and urbanizing.
None has grown to high income without
vibrant cities. The rush to cities in developing countries seems chaotic, but it is necessary. It seems unprecedented, but it has
happened before (see figure 5). It had to
have, because the move to density that is
manifest in urbanization is closely related

Overview

to the transformation of an economy from
agrarian to industrial to postindustrial.
Governments can facilitate the spatial
transformations that lie behind these sectoral changes. Depending on the stage of
urbanization, sequencing and prioritysetting require paying attention to different
aspects of the geographic transformation.
What does not change is that a foundation
of institutions must be universal and come
first, investments in connective infrastructure should be both timed and located well
and come second, and spatially targeted
interventions should be used least and last.
The approach requires the discipline of
following the integration principle set out
earlier. The payoff is a spatial transformation that is both efficient and inclusive (see
chapter 7).
The principles outlined in the Report
help to prioritize policies for different stages
of urbanization, providing the elements
of an urbanization strategy. Map 6 shows
three areas in Colombia, each with a specific geography. But the principles are quite
universal.

•

Incipient urbanization. In places that
are mostly rural, governments should
be as neutral as possible and should

establish the institutional foundation
of possible urbanization in some places.
Good land policies are central, and so
are policies to provide basic services
to everyone. For example, the universalization of land rights in Denmark
at the turn of the eighteenth century
contributed greatly to the nation’s takeoff into industrialization a few decades
later. Indeed, policies to strengthen rural
property rights are seen as instrumental
for higher agricultural productivity in
sixteenth-century England, which freed
workers to migrate to towns to work
in manufacturing and services. A close
complement to the institutions for better land markets is the universal provision of basic social services—security,
education, health services, and sanitation. In 1960, the Republic of Korea had
a per capita income level that Benin has
today. Seventy-five percent of its people
lived in rural areas, more than a third
of Korean adults had no schooling, and
fewer than 5 percent of children had
been immunized against preventable
diseases such as measles. By 2000, more
than 80 percent had urbanized, almost
everyone was literate and immunized,

Concentration without congestion in western
China: Chongqing and Chengdu

An experiment in China might change
the future of urbanization policy in
the developing world. Policy makers
should take notice.
China is taking inland the urbanization strategy that was successful in
the leading coastal areas in the 1980s
and 1990s. The “area approach” is
being implemented in two places—
Chongqing and Chengdu, both
located in the near west. At about 40
percent, they have the same urbanization ratio as the average for China. The
aim is to increase that to 70 percent by
2020, promoting both concentration
and rural-urban convergence.
Chongqing has a population of
about 40 million, with a portfolio of
a capital city, six large cities, 25 small
and mid-size cities, 95 central townships, and 400 townships. Chongqing
has been accorded the status of
a special municipality, as Beijing,
Shanghai, and Tianjin have had for
some years. Like them, it will enjoy
greater financial autonomy. Chengdu
is smaller, a sprawling metropolitan
area with 11 million people. Along
with the 2,000-year-old capital city of
Sichuan province, it has eight medium-size cities, 30 central townships,
60 townships, and 600 villages.
The urbanization strategy involves
“three concentrations” of land,
industry, and farmers. The idea is to
reap the benefits of scale economies,
promote the mobility of goods and
workers, and improve the well-being
of new migrants to cities. Consistent
with the policy priorities outlined for
areas with intermediate urban shares
of about 40–50 percent, the emphasis
in both places is on universal institutions and connective infrastructure,
not spatially targeted interventions.

•

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 26

Better institutions. The emphasis
is on coordination across government
levels to manage land use and conversion. In the countryside, the plan
concentrates rural land by transferring use rights to firms and farmers.
In towns and cities, the creation of
industrial zones is a key part of the
wider framework. Large and medium
cities are developing high valueadded manufacturing, while smaller
cities and towns are specializing in
labor-intensive industries, pulling in
labor from nearby villages, and facilitating localization economies.
More infrastructure. Massive trunk
infrastructure is planned. Chongqing
will spend billions on infrastructure,
from the central government and
through increased private investment from Hong Kong, China, and
from Singapore. In Chengdu, about
117 billion yuan will be invested in
71 infrastructure projects, including
rural-urban transport networks, and
water and sanitation projects in both
rural and urban areas. Another 16.5
billion yuan will be invested in 34
social projects to improve the living
standards of lagging rural residents.
If markets favor the two places as
much as the government has, they
will improve the lives of millions in
the Chinese hinterland. The integration already has had a local impact.
In Chongqing, rural incomes in 2007
increased faster than those of urban
residents. In Chengdu, farmer concentrations are believed to have led
to a productivity increase of 80 percent, as industry has been absorbing
about 100,000 farmers a year.

reached that of modern-day Portugal.
Another good example is Costa Rica.
Intermediate urbanization. In places
where urbanization has picked up
speed, in addition to these institutions,
governments must put in place connective infrastructure so that the benefits

•

of rising economic density are more
widely shared. Industrialization involves
changing land use patterns as activities
concentrate, and requires moving goods
and services around quickly. Land use
regulations can affect location decisions,
and they continue to be the institutional
priority. Spatially blind social services
should continue as part of rural-urban
integration, so that people are pulled to
cities by agglomeration economies, not
pushed out by the lack of schools, health
services, and public security in rural
areas. But even if these services are provided, transport costs can rise quickly
because of growing congestion, affecting
the location choices of entrepreneurs.
Connective infrastructure is needed to
keep such areas integrated. State and central governments that work well together
can provide the trunk infrastructure
necessary to ensure that prosperity is
widely shared. Making the administrative jurisdiction wider can help in coordinating infrastructure investments. A
good example is Chongqing in western
China (see box 5).
Advanced urbanization. In highly urbanized areas, besides institutions and infrastructure, targeted interventions may be
necessary to deal with the problem of
slums. Services and learning require people to be in proximity to livable surroundings. This is the stage in which slums can
compromise a city’s ability to deliver the
economies that come from proximity.
Slum-improvement programs may not
be a priority at earlier stages of urbanization, but at this stage they become necessary. The lesson from assessments of
slum-improvement initiatives is that targeted interventions will not be enough
by themselves. These interventions will
not work unless institutions related to
land and basic services are reasonably
effective, and transport infrastructure is
in place. A three-dimensional challenge
must be met by a three-pronged policy
response, requiring coordinated policies
at the central, state, and city levels of government. Singapore’s success shows the
advantages of such coordination in a citystate. More recent examples are Shanghai

Overview

and Guangzhou in China. An even more
recent (and perhaps more generally applicable) example is Bogotá in Colombia.
The experience of successful urbanizers indicates that the basis of successful
rural-urban transformations is a set of spatially blind policies—“institutions” in the
shorthand of this Report. Investments in
infrastructure that connects places form
the second tier. Geographically targeted
interventions should be used only when the
challenge is especially difficult, but should
always be used together with an effort to
improve institutions and infrastructure.

Area (territorial) development policies
that integrate nations
Some parts of a country are better suited
for agriculture, others for industry, and
still others for services. And as industry
and services flourish, the spatial distribution of economic activities must change.11
No country has grown to riches without
changing the geographic distribution of its
people and production.
A rising concentration of people and
production in some parts of a country has
marked economic growth over the last
two centuries. To fight this concentration
is to fight growth itself, and policy makers
must show patience in dealing with these
imbalances. But aided by government policies, successful development also has been
marked by falling disparities in living standards between places favored by markets
and those less fortunate. Policies can speed
up the convergence in basic living standards, so that people in the least-fortunate
places do not have to wait for basic public
amenities until their nations reach high
income levels. The experience of successful developers also justifies impatience in
equalizing basic living standards.
Consider Malaysia. Economic growth
and government policies have reduced
poverty and improved living standards,
speeding progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals. But in the
early years of growth (between 1970 and
1976), poverty rates between different states
diverged briefly, to later converge as they
declined for all states (see figure 6). Health
indicators (infant mortality) declined more

in the slower-growing states, implying that
tax and transfer mechanisms worked well.
Such impatience with spatial inequality
in living standards is paying off in other
countries such as China, Egypt, Indonesia,
Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam.
But not all countries have experienced
geographic convergence in the Millennium
Development Indicators, such as child mortality, maternal health, basic education, safe
water, and sanitation. What should they do?
The answer lies in integrating lagging and
leading areas, using policies that are tailored
to the level of difficulty of integration. While
economic motives are important, social and
political conditions influence the speed of
these spatial changes. The location choices
that people make reflect the strengths and
inclinations of societies and political structures. Poverty maps provide a snapshot of
where the poor are concentrated (high poverty mass—that is, the “poor people”), and
which places are the poorest (high poverty
rate—that is, the “poor places”). These maps
can tell us a lot about the social and political conditions in a country: the movement of
poor people may best reflect the constraints to
mobility, because they have the most reason
to move and the fewest resources to do so.
Using information on where poor people
are located and which places are poor, the
policy response can be calibrated to country conditions.

are in the western provinces, but the poor
are concentrated in the southeast and central areas (see map 7, panel a). Economic
density and population density overlap.
The country has few divisions—linguistic
and other barriers are not high—and people, including the poor, can move to reduce
their distance to density. Spatially blind
institutions that ensure well-functioning
land markets, enforce property rights, and
deliver basic social services such as schooling and health care can be the mainstay of
an economic integration strategy to reduce
the economic distance between lagging
and leading areas. Chile, Egypt, Honduras,
Indonesia, Russia, Uganda, and Vietnam
are other examples of countries where the
area development challenge is unidimensional—the main problem is distance.
Undivided countries with densely populated lagging areas. In Brazil the poverty
rates are highest in the north and northeast: eight of the ten poorest states are in
the northeast, the other two are in the
north (see map 7, panel b). But the economic mass and the concentration of
poverty are highest in the urban agglomerations near the coast, from the poor
northeast to the thriving southeast. Economic and population densities coincide
only partially. The poverty-related symptoms are those of a country where withincountry divisions such as ethnolinguistic
differences and political fragmentation
are low, but where population densities
are—for historical and policy-related
reasons—in the “wrong places.” Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, and Turkey have
similar conditions. In such places the
pull of agglomeration economies in leading areas and the mobility of labor may
not be strong enough to induce concentration and convergence. The problems
of “long distance and wrong density”
must be met by a two-pronged policy
of economic integration: spatially blind
institutions should be augmented by spatially connective infrastructure, such as
interregional highways and railroads and
improved telecommunications.
Divided countries with densely populated lagging areas. In India more than
400 million people live in the central lag-

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 29

ging states, home to more than 60 percent
of the nation’s poor (see map 7, panel c).
People live there for a reason: it is a fertile plain and was the cradle of Indian
civilization. But their location is less fortunate now, as the world has changed.
Labor mobility is limited because of linguistic and class divisions. Mobility has
not been helped by policies that sought to
revive growth in these lagging provinces
through subsidized finance and preferential industrial licensing. The debate is now
shifting toward economic integration—
policies more consistent with mobility of
labor such as interregional infrastructure
and better health and education services.
These policies and the interstate migration they encourage will, if given time,
reduce the divisions that have made the
distances long between leading areas
and densely populated lagging areas.
In the meantime, these areas may need
a helping hand—from geographically
targeted incentives that encourage local
production. Another country with a
three-dimensional integration agenda of
distance, densely populated poor areas,
and domestic divisions may be Nigeria.
In such places, the policy response has to
be a blend of spatially blind, connective,
and targeted policies.
Governments should not be faulted
for being impatient with markets, and
for trying to help lagging areas. But targeted interventions should be designed to
work with the institutional reforms and
the investments in infrastructure. Experience suggests that incentives should not
be provided for activities that depend on
agglomeration economies or international
market access. Incentives for agriculture
are prime candidates in these largely rural
and agrarian areas. Relying mainly on targeted incentives for industry—as India
did for decades—will not help the lagging
states improve living standards to levels in
the leading states.

Regional integration to increase access
to global markets
The merits of global versus regional trade
agreements have been debated for years.
The debate is now largely concluded. Where

if the scale of production is big, and that
requires reaching the big markets of the
Northern Hemisphere.
What do late developers have to do to
accelerate development? The common condition is division—that is, thick borders.
What differs is their distance from large
world markets and whether or not there is
a large country in their neighborhood (see
map 8, panel b).

regional or bilateral pacts do not discourage
trade with countries in other regions, and
where they are accompanied by measures
to facilitate the flows of goods, people, and
fi nance—such as infrastructure and compensatory mechanisms—they can help.
Otherwise, they are not worth the trouble.
This Report does not reopen that
debate. Instead, it takes up the question
of how developing countries can best gain
access to markets within their neighborhoods and across the world. Geography
matters greatly in deciding what is needed,
what is unnecessary, and what will fail. But
with the right mix of policy actions, even
countries in parts of the world that have
been left far behind can overcome their
geographic disadvantage. The way to tell if
the actions are paying dividends is whether
market access improves noticeably.
Some regions of the world have done
better than others (see figure 7). Countries
in these regions now have thinner economic borders (see map 8, panel a). They
can afford to have thin borders, because
their neighbors are prospering too. For
them, regional markets are world markets.
Others, like the East Asians, have allowed
production relationships to grow strong
and cut paths even through thick borders.
But specializing can increase efficiency only

WDR09_01_Overview.indd 30

•

Countries in regions near large world
markets. For countries near large markets, regional and global integration does
not require geographic differentiation.
Spatially blind measures such as improving economic policies and the investment climate will attract capital and
technology from the more sophisticated
markets nearby. Their underused talent
and cheaper labor are powerful draws.
Whether they lag or lead within the
region is hardly relevant; the presence of
a sun nearby makes them all small planets. Mexican exports to the United States
are about 1.7 percent of the U.S. economy. Mexico should build even stronger links with the United States. But for
other countries in Central America, the
payoffs to infrastructure connections to
Mexico are small—the market in North
America dwarfs all of Central America’s.
And market access likely depends most
on economic stability. Spatially blind
institutions should be able to integrate
Central America with world markets.
The same is true for Eastern Europe and
North Africa. Countries in these regions
have better-than-average market access,
though depending on their economic
policies and regulations, this access is
not uniform even within these regions
(see map 8, panel c).
Countries in regions distant from
large world markets that have a large
economy. To integrate regions more
distant from large world markets but
with a sizable economy—East Asia,
Latin America, Southern Africa, and
South Asia—such spatially blind measures are just as necessary, but they may
not be sufficient. For lagging countries
in these regions, such as Mongolia,

Nepal, Paraguay, and Zimbabwe, some
of the paths to world markets may go
through their larger neighbors. Brazil,
China, and India are attractive to investors because of their potential market
size, and these “home market effects”
can generate the impetus for specialization and help their enterprises compete in world markets. A qualification:
for market access, the relevant measure
of distance is economic, not Euclidean.
With a combination of bilateral accords,
inspired transport policies, and aggressive specialization in primary products,
Chile reduced distance to North America and built global rather than regional
links. But such cases are exceptions. For
the smaller countries in these regions,
both institutional reforms and regional
connectivity will be necessary for economic integration.
Countries in regions distant from world
markets without large economies. The
most difficult challenges are for the
countries in parts of the world divided
by thick borders, distant from world
markets, and without a large country
that can serve as a regional conduit
to world markets, as Brazil and India
might. For these regions, economic
geography poses a three-dimensional
challenge. Côte d’Ivoire or Tanzania

can hardly be blamed for worrying
most about their own poor, and not
their less fortunate neighbors such as
Burkina Faso or Burundi. Indeed, seeing the benefits of regional cooperation,
they have made repeated efforts to foster integration in their neighborhoods.
The ECOWAS even includes a clause
that allows workers to cross borders, a
stage of integration rivaled only (and
only recently) by the EU. It also has
tried to share regional infrastructure.
Other such regions are Central Africa,
Central Asia, and the Pacific Islands.
Countries in such regions face a threedimensional challenge (see “Geography in Motion: Density, Distance, and
Division in Sub- Saharan Africa”). A
combination of efforts to improve institutional cooperation and regional infrastructure investments is needed—but it
is not enough. Targeted incentives also
will be necessary, through preferential
access to developed country markets,
perhaps made conditional on regional
collaboration to improve institutions
and infrastructure.
Everyone should support the efforts of
these “bottom billion” countries to integrate their economies, within and across
borders. A billion lives depend on it.

We are familiar with the sectoral transformations needed for economic growth—the
changes in work and organization as agrarian economies become industrialized and service
oriented. This Report discusses the spatial transformations that also must happen for countries to develop. Higher densities, shorter distances, and lower divisions will remain essential
for economic success in the foreseeable future. They should be encouraged. With them will
come unbalanced growth. When accompanied by policies for integration calibrated to the
economic geography of nations, these changes also will bring inclusive development—sooner,
not much later.

n 1971 Simon Kuznets, a Russian émigré
who had built his career in the United
States, was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Economics “for his empirically founded
interpretation of economic growth, which
has led to new and deepened insight into the
economic and social structure and process
of development.”1 In his prize lecture, Kuznets summarized the structural changes that
accompany economic growth, emphasizing
“the shift away from agriculture to nonagricultural pursuits and, recently, away from
industry to services.”2 These are the sectoral
changes in production needed for nations to
prosper. Nations do not develop by merely
doing more of the same thing. They must do
different things, and do them better.
Over the years, this has been confirmed
so often that it now seems almost obvious.
Less obvious but no less important are the
spatial transformations needed for these
structural shifts. Some places are suited
for farming, others for industry, yet others
for services. As economies become industrialized and more people are employed
in services, their shapes must change, too.
These changes, involving social adjustment
as much as the economic, can take time.
The economic world is not frictionless. The
“what” and “how” of economic production
cannot be decided without deciding the
“where.”
For policy makers, especially, it is
important to understand these changes and
to appreciate the market forces that shape
them. This understanding can be the difference between prosperity and stagnation. It

may even be one of the main lessons of the
twentieth century. After Kuznets left Russia
in 1922, Soviet planners implemented one
approach to economic geography, and the
United States implemented another. The
Soviet strategy forced people to move to
the north and east and to spread out economic production. Meanwhile, Americans
moved voluntarily toward the south and the
west, but production became more concentrated. Within five years of Kuznets’ death
in 1985, the Soviet Union would collapse.
At the time, Russia’s per capita income was
a quarter that of the United States. Spatial
inefficiency was not the only reason whyy
the Soviet Union fell. But it could not have
helped.
As Russia has moved from plan to market, spatial efficiency increased. Between
1989 and 2004, almost all new firms chose
locations with the best access to Moscow,
St. Petersburg, and international markets.3
Over the past three decades, researchers
have been documenting the changes in
economic geography needed to stay spatially efficient as technology advances and
production structures change. They have
studied the effects of larger populations,
globalizing markets, and international
borders on the location of people and production. They are starting to assess how
governments can help or hurt these transformations. This Report draws on this work
and its implications for public policy.
Government policies are important.
With development, people and production
become more concentrated—in towns and

cities, and in areas of countries closer to
domestic and international markets. While
economic activity concentrates in some
parts of a nation or the globe, many people
may be spread out over the countryside or
in places distant from prosperity, perhaps
opening sizable geographic disparities in
living standards. This Report discusses why
this happens, and assesses what has been
most effective in altering the economic
geography of developing countries. Economic activity will concentrate in any case.
But managed one way, as the United States
did, it can foster growth and integration.
Managed another way, it can result in disintegration and despair, and even conflict.
The Report covers a broad and seemingly
disparate set of phenomena that span the
spectrum from local to national to international scales, from human to physical to
political geography, and from national and
global institutions to targeted interventions.

emphasizing some aspects of spatial transformations and leaving others out. The rest

What this Report is not about

To keep the Report focused, several
important aspects of the spatial
transformations do not get the attention they would in a fuller study. The
main aspects not considered—except when emphasizing or qualifying
the most important messages—are
the social and environmental effects
of a changing economic geography.
Agglomeration—the growth of
cities—can have social and environmental effects that are beneficial and
some that are detrimental. Cities help
to break down societal stereotypes
and increase cohesion. Most progressive movements throughout history
have had urban origins. But so have
the most violent. The propensity of
people to commit crimes is believed
to be greater in cities. And while cities allow individualism and creativity
and break down social barriers, they
also break societal ties:
The cities have always been the cradles
of liberty, just as they are today the
centres of radicalism. Every man of the
world knows that isolation and solitude

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 34

are found in a much greater degree in a
crowded city than in a country village,
where one’s individual concerns are the
concern of everyone.a

Migration also can have vastly different effects across societies, both in
the places people leave and to those
places they go. It almost always brings
economic rewards, but as the antiimmigrant sentiments in many countries show, it also means more risk.
Specialization of production made
possible by falling transport costs can
come at an environmental price. Cod
is caught off Norway, transported by
plane to China to be cleaned, and
then flown back to Norway to be sold.
Such specialization based on natural
endowments (fish in Northern Europe,
people in China) helps both Norwegian consumers and Chinese workers,
but the cod now has a longer carbon
trail. The environmental effects of
urbanization and transport are considered in this Report, but only when
they qualify the Report’s messages.

of this chapter summarizes the Report’s
scope, clarifies its terms, and outlines its
structure.

Scope
Governments intervene (usually incorrectly)
to spread the benefits of economic growth
more evenly across space. Even when the
imperatives are political, they have economic
consequences. And even if the objectives are
economic, they have social and environmental effects. Policy makers thus face sharp
tradeoffs and must compromise. The economic costs of mistakes can be large and lasting: recognizing the importance of economic
geography means realizing that once producers and people make decisions on where to
locate, they can be difficult to reverse.
Governments can do better by promoting
the market forces that deliver both the concentration of economic production and the
convergence of living standards, and augment them with policies to ensure affordable basic services everywhere. They can do
this by helping people and entrepreneurs
take advantage of economic opportunities,
wherever they arise. The market forces that
help most are agglomeration, migration, and
specialization. Their economic benefits are
the subject of this Report. Their social and
environmental implications are not considered in detail (see box 0.1). The unintended
social and environmental effects of market
forces are important policy matters. But they
deserve more space than can be covered in a
report that shows how economic geography
is reshaped during development.
The Report describes the geographic
transformations needed for development.
It analyzes these changes using the insights
from economic history and recent research.
It then revisits the policy debates on urbanization, regional development, and international integration. This is the 31st World
Development Report, and the issues it covers
have been visited by earlier Reports. But here
the facts, analysis, and policies related to spatial transformations are the major focus, and
the Report is structured accordingly.

Terms

to policy makers requires an uncomplicated

terminology. The Report uses some terms
that may not be familiar to readers, introduces others, and uses yet others as shorthand. This section clarifies the terms that
the rest of the Report uses consistently.

•

Spatial scales—area, country, and region
Throughout the Report, the analysis is provided at three geographic scales—local,
national, and international. The policy concerns that correspond to these spatial scales
are, respectively, the speed and sustainability
of the rural-urban transformation, the territorial disparities in production and welfare
within countries, and the same disparities
across countries and world regions. The units
that correspond to these spatial scales are area,
country, and region. These terms are used
consistently throughout the Report. An “area”
is the same as a “territory,” the target of territorial development policies. In Anglophone
countries, it is the same as a “region” within a
country, as in the debates on “regional development.” Area is used here to avoid confusion
with another spatial scale, the international,
because “region” also describes a group of
countries, such as South Asia, which includes
India and its neighbors.
To fi x the terms, consider the three geographic scales of the Shanghai metropolitan area, the country of China, and the East
Asia region (see map 0.1):

•

Area. The local scale is the municipality
of Shanghai—which includes the city of
Shanghai and neighboring cities, towns,
and villages in an area of about 7,000
square kilometers, with a population

•

density of about 3,000 persons per square
kilometer. The population density in the
city is about 13,000 persons per square
kilometer.
Country. The national scale encompasses the 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, and four municipalities
(Shanghai is one of them) that make
up China, covering about 9.6 million
square kilometers. The distance between
the western province of Xinjiang and the
dynamic coastal areas in the east is more
than 4,000 kilometers. Restrictions on
internal migration can make the economic distance seem much longer.
Region. The international scale consists of China and its East Asian neighbors including Japan, Mongolia, and the
Republic of Korea. The region is divided

This Report uses the notion of “natural” neighborhoods, defi ned by elements
of human, physical, and political geography. The World Bank commonly classifies
all low- and middle-income countries into
six regions, and groups all high-income
countries together, regardless of their location. This Report classifies the world into
16 regions that include both developed and
developing countries, using geographic
proximity as the most important criterion (see box 0.2). It is also more detailed.
Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has four
regions—West, Central, East, and Southern.
East Asia and the Pacific has three—Northeast, Southeast, and the Pacific Islands. The

term “region” is used throughout the Report
to refer to these 16 groups of countries.
While the choice of area or region can
be arbitrary, these spatial scales conform
well to the levels of policy making. This
Report aims to inform policy making at
these three levels—subnational, national,
and international.

Spatial dimensions—density, distance,
and division
To describe the geographic transformations that accompany development, the
Report introduces the use of three spatial
dimensions—density, distance, and division. These dimensions help the reader see
development in real space—in three dimensions, in other words. The terms are easy
metaphors, but they also have a technical

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 36

interpretation. Density generally signifies
the intensity of economic activity on a unit
of land, say, a square kilometer. Data limitations can force compromise: since production and population densities are closely
related, and production data are less easily
available, population density is sometimes
used as a proxy for economic density. It can
get a bit confusing. London is probably the
city with the highest economic density in
the world, but Mumbai, with 30,000 people
per square kilometer, is the most densely
populated. Distance signifies the costs of
getting to places with economic density.
While density and distance relate closely
to human and physical geography, division
refers more to sociopolitical geography.
Religion, ethnicity, and language are among
the main attributes that lead to divisions

10/8/08 5:56:55 PM

between places. While divisions are greatest across nations, they can be considerable
within countries as well.
These dimensions are measurable. But
unlike height, length, and breadth, for
example, the geographic dimensions are
not orthogonal. Better analogs for the three
dimensions are a person’s height, weight,
and age, which are related. Likewise, as distances increase, it is likely that divisions also
get stronger. Density, distance, and division
are best illustrated by market access, an
indicator of economic opportunity for a
location that tells the size of the potential
markets in its vicinity, and the ease of reaching them. Market access across geographic
scales determines where economic activity
can thrive and thus where firms will locate
and populations will grow.
Using this concept of market access, the
three dimensions are defined as follows:

•

•

•

Density indicates the size of economic
output or total purchasing power per
unit of surface area—say, a square kilometer. It is highest in large cities where
economic activity is concentrated and
much lower in rural neighborhoods.
Distance measures the ease of reaching
markets. It determines access to opportunity. Areas far from economically
dense centers in a country are more
likely to lag.
Division arises from barriers to economic interactions created by differences
in currencies, customs, and languages,
which restrict market access. It is most
relevant in an international context.

The concept of distance is also relevant
internationally. The difference between
distance and division is that distance modulates access to economic opportunity in a
more continuous way—a distance decay.
Division, by contrast, presents discrete
barriers to access and economic integration. It can be seen as increasing economic
distance or travel time for a unit of physical
(or Euclidian) distance.
These definitions are not scientifically
exact. But the terms are used consistently
in the Report. When “density” is used, it
means economic density: production per
area of land. When any other measure of

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 37

37

density—such as the population per square
kilometer (as in chapters 1 and 7) or the
places where more of a nation’s poor people
live (as in chapters 2 and 8), it is qualified
accordingly.
Distance can be measured with some
precision, but where infrastructure is sparse,
straight-line distance is different from road
or rail distance. Many other factors, such as
the availability and affordability of transport services, determine actual accessibility. Where such information is available,
it is used. Chapter 1, for example, reports a
uniform measure of urbanization based on
places that both have minimum levels of
population density and are within an hour’s
travel time to sizable settlements. In computing this “agglomeration index,” the quality of transport infrastructure is taken into
account. Division is associated with international borders, because they usually impede
the ease of exchange or travel. But not all borders imply divisions. Those in the European
Union (EU), for instance, have increasingly
ceased to reflect divisions between countries.
And not all divisions imply international borders. Where religious, ethnic, and linguistic
differences are manifest spatially, there can
be divisions within countries.
There is a correspondence between the
geographic scales and dimensions. Locally,
within an area, the most important dimension is density, because generally distances
are short and divisions few. Nationally, the
most important dimension is distance to
density; divisions within countries tend
to be fewer, though they can be serious in
some countries. Internationally, across a
regional or global spatial scale, distances
and divisions are usually more serious.
Using these three dimensions, the Report
summarizes the geographic transformations
needed for development (part one). It shows
how market forces drive these transformations (part two). And it assesses how governments can augment these forces to sustain
growth and reduce poverty (part three).

Instruments for integration—
institutions, infrastructure, and
interventions
Through good policies, governments can
promote economic integration between

10/8/08 5:56:56 PM

38

WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 0 9

places where economic production is
concentrated and places that are lagging.
Some of these policy instruments are spatially explicit, like a slum-upgrading program in a city, a Brazilian state’s fi scal
incentives to a U.S. automobile company,
or the EU’s structural and cohesion funds.
Others are intended to be universal in their
coverage, including compulsory and free
basic education for all children, such labor
market regulations as minimum wage laws,
and the enforcement of property rights.
Between these spatially targeted programs
and “spatially blind” policies are investments and regulations that connect places,
such as roads, airports, and communications systems.
In their current form, the debates on
how governments can foster rural-urban
transformation, help lagging areas reduce
poverty, and—in the poorest nations in the
world—improve access to world markets all
emphasize geographic targeting. The debate
on how to promote healthy urbanization is
polarized between an emphasis on villages,
where a majority of the world’s poor still
live, and a belief that the way out of poverty
lies in cities; if urban poverty increases, the
focus shifts from villages to slums. Motivated by within-country spatial disparities
in living standards, the debate on territorial
development tends to be similarly fi xated
on promoting economic growth in lagging
areas. At the international level, preferential
market access for the least developed countries can end up dominating policy discussions. Part three of the Report reframes
these debates, calling for a shift from spatial
targeting to integration.
The policy instruments for economic
integration can be classified in three categories, based on how explicitly place is
considered in their scope and design:

•

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 38

Institutions is shorthand for all the policy instruments that are spatially blind.
These are the amenities that governments
should provide to everyone, regardless
of place. The word “institutions” connotes universality, and includes mechanisms for financing and delivering such
basic amenities as the administration of
justice, public security, the regulation of
land, labor, and capital markets, primary

•

•

education and health, and electricity,
water, and sanitation. Systems for collecting taxes and financing the spending
associated with these services are also
best designed without specific places in
mind.
Infrastructure is the summary term for
all spatially connective investments and
the associated rules and regulations. It
includes roads and railways, airports
and air transport systems, telecommunications, and the Internet.
Interventions is shorthand for all spatially focused incentives. These include
regulations and investments that favor
some places, such as export processing
zones. They also include place-based programs—such as slum-upgrading schemes
like Rio de Janeiro’s Favela Bairro, or
Superintendency for the Development of
the Northeast (SUDENE), Brazil’s development agency for the lagging Northeast,
or the Everything But Arms initiative of
the EU, which gives the least developed
countries preferential trade access to
European markets.

Because these defi nitions do not conform strictly to common usage, additional
clarification is necessary:

•

•

•

First, spatial blindness does not mean
spatial neutrality. A progressive tax system, for example, may not be neutral in
its effects or outcomes. Cities may end
up contributing more in taxes than the
countryside, and richer states may contribute more than those that are poorer.
But the guiding principle is that tax rates
differ not by place alone, but by the attributes of firms and families that happen
to be located there.
Second, in the common use of the term,
infrastructure includes nonconnective
investments such as water supply and
energy. In this Report, infrastructure is
reserved for the spatially connective components. Nonconnective public utilities
are included in institutions, as for such
basic services as sanitation.
Third, each of these categories includes
all three tools of government policy—
taxes, transfers and public expenditures,
and regulations.

•

Finally, government initiatives can include
more than one instrument. Slum development can include steps to make urban
land markets work better by formalizing
property rights, improving streets, and
offering monetary incentives for some of
the slum-dwellers to relocate.

Structure
The main fi nding of this Report—at all
three spatial scales—is that economic
development is not smooth, linear, or neat.
The processes of economic growth leave
behind a bumpy landscape, with economic
mass concentrated in some places. Living standards in such places—especially
rising prosperity, good access to education and health facilities, and safe shelter,
water, and sanitation, some of the most
urgent among the Millennium Development Goals—improve faster than where
there is less economic activity, widening
the spatial disparities in welfare. But where
there is sustained economic growth, the
convergence in living standards begins to
supplant divergence. Nations become both
spatially efficient and equitable (see box
0.3). The challenge of development is to
institute policies that allow—even encourage—“unbalanced” economic growth and
yet ensure geographically balanced development outcomes.

The facts
Part one of the Report presents the facts
about the spatial transformations—the
changes in economic density, distance,
and division. Chapter 1 shows that development is accompanied by the rising density of human settlements: no country has
reached high income without this rise in
density. Chapter 2 expands the scale and
shows that development is also accompanied by the greater concentration of economic activity in areas of countries closer
to economic density. Chapter 3 incorporates international divisions that slow, but
do not prevent, the concentration of economic activities in some countries. At the
local, national, and international scales the
pattern is similar: rapidly rising concentrations at the early stage and then a slowing
down.

This Report’s message is not anti-equity

Policies for spatially balanced growth
are often justified by equity. The EU
describes its territorial policy as governed by the principle of solidarity
because it “aims to benefit citizens
and regions that are economically
and socially deprived relative to
EU averages.”a The policy seems to
equate social and spatial equity—
equality across individuals, and the
equality of living standards across
states and countries. This Report, by
contrast, argues in favor of the benefits from geographic concentration
of economic production. But it shows
that in the earlier stages of development, increased concentration is
associated with spatial divergence in
living standards such as income. So is
this Report’s message anti-equity?
No. It is important to distinguish
between three types of disparities:
spatial disparities in economic production, spatial disparities in living
standards, and social inequality.
Spatial disparities in economic
activity. In both the United States
and the EU-15 countries, gross
domestic product (GDP) and population have lumpy spatial distributions.
In the United States, three states
(California, New York, and Texas)
generated 21 percent of national GDP
in 2005. The same three states have
19.8 percent of the U.S. population,
but only 12.8 percent of the country’s
land. Meanwhile, 10 EU subnational
areas were responsible for 20.5 percent of the EU’s GDP in 2005. These
areas have 16.9 percent of the EU-15’s
population, but only 8 percent of
its land. So, in both cases, economic
activity and population are concentrated. But spatial inequality of
production and population is higher
in the United States than in the EU.

The Gini coefficient for the spatial
inequality of GDP is 0.53 for the
United States and 0.41 for the EU. For
population, the coefficients are 0.54
and 0.32, respectively. For subnational areas in the EU and states in the
United States, the numbers change,
but the conclusion is the same.b
Spatial disparities in living standards. EU-15 countries have greater
spatial inequality in per capita income
and unemployment rates, two common indicators of individual living
standards in high-income countries.
GDP per capita, for example, exhibited greater variation across EU areas
than it did across U.S. states in 2005.
Although production is more concentrated geographically in the United
States, people are also more likely to
live where production is, so GDP per
capita varies less. The same is true of
unemployment rates. In the United
States, the state with the highest
unemployment in 2007 (Michigan)
had an unemployment rate of 7.2
percent, 2.8 times the lowest unemployment state (Hawaii). But in the EU
in 2006, the ratio was 8.1. There is less
spatial inequality in living standards
in the United States.
Social inequality. While spatial
inequality in living standards is greater
in the EU than in the United States, the
opposite is true for social inequality
between individuals. During the past
few decades, the Gini coefficient for
the United States has been about 0.40,
compared with 0.33, 0.28, and 0.23 for
the United Kingdom, Germany, and
Austria, respectively.c

The long experience of countries shows
that income differences between leading
places and following places fi rst diverge
and then converge, but only in the more
dynamic areas, countries, and regions. At
each of the three spatial scales, it pays to
be in dynamic neighborhoods. Economic
growth leads to congestion in cities—and to

10/8/08 5:56:56 PM

40

WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 0 9

the growth of towns and cities that are well
connected to fast-growing agglomerations.
This pattern is repeated at the national and
international levels. Expanding economic
activity spills over to areas and countries
that are—in economic terms—near places
doing well.

The insights
The second part of the Report is the “engine
room.” It exploits the main insights from a
quarter century of work spanning several
subdisciplines in economics, such as industrial organization, urban economics, international trade, and economic geography.
Distilled to its essence, the engine works
through a three-way interaction between
scale economies, the mobility of workers
and entrepreneurs, and the costs of transporting and communicating between places
(see figure 0.1).
Firms are generally more productive
when they locate in large places and when
they operate at a relatively large size. If it
is relatively easy to transport produce, the
scale can be even higher, since the potential market is bigger. Workers move to these
places, bringing with them both a supply of
labor and a demand for goods and services.
As people become more mobile and as
transport and communications costs fall,
these economies of scale create a circular
and cumulative causation, where economic
activities become even more concentrated
spatially. Rising concentration inevitably
leads to congestion, which slows the process and eventually reverses it. Declines
in transport costs fi rst make concentration possible, and then, when they fall low
enough, they make it unnecessary.
Part two discusses these interactions in
some detail, summarizing more than a century of experience and the novel insights
that come from a generation of research
recognizing how factor mobility and falling transport costs feed economies of scale
(see box 0.2). They should change what we
can expect from the markets, and what governments can and should do to facilitate the
concentration of production and promote
the convergence in living standards.
Chapter 4 provides evidence of agglomeration economies—increasing returns to

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 40

scale associated with places, not plants—in
producing goods, services, and ideas. Places
of different sizes provide varying agglomeration benefits, and congestion associated
with spatial concentration leads to a portfolio of places that facilitate economic growth,
with different parts in the lead depending
on the stage of development.
Chapter 5 explains the interaction
between scale economies and factor mobility, focusing on the migration of workers.
Chapter 6 explains the nonlinear relationship between transport costs and the
geographic concentrations of production,
focusing on intraindustry trade, which is
especially sensitive to transport costs. These
chapters summarize the new insights provided by the three-way interaction between
scale economies, factor mobility, and transport costs—and their implications for
development policy (see box 0.4).

The policy framework
Circular causation, unevenness, and spillovers make for a world in which policies can promote economic growth and
improve social welfare beyond what markets yield, because well-executed policies
can set these transformations in motion or
speed them up.
These features of economic development also make policy making a difficult enterprise. Part three of the Report
reframes three important policy debates,
using a principle derived from its fi rst two
parts: for developing countries to realize
the benefits of both spatial concentration
of production and convergence in consumption, development is best facilitated
by economic integration. Using the three
dimensions—density, distance, and division—described in part one, and the (mal)
functioning of pivotal markets at each spatial scale—land, labor, and intermediate
inputs—analyzed in part two, the chapters
in part three provide a simple framework
and illustrate its workings through realworld policy experience. At each of the
geographic scales, the response rule is the
same—an instrument per dimension. Here
is a somewhat oversimplified summary,
using examples from only the local scale
(chapter 7):

Fresh insights from economic geography: concentration, convergence, and integration

Over the past two decades, new analysis
has changed the way we think about the
location of production, trade, and development. The analysis builds on two elements.
First, large markets are disproportionately
attractive for firms producing with scale
economies. Firms with a larger home
market have more sales that, with scale
economies, imply lower unit costs and
more profits, which encourage existing
firms to expand and attract new firms. Second, large markets are big partly because
many firms and consumers locate there.
Market access and mobility creates a circular and cumulative causation. A large market attracts firms and workers—and the
demand for intermediate inputs by firms
and the demand for final goods by workers
make the market even larger, attracting
more firms and workers, and so on.
This is both good and bad news for
places with poor initial conditions. It is
good because it means that firm location
is not as constrained by nature as theories
based on comparative advantage would
have us believe. Places with poor endowments can sustain concentration of activity.
It is bad news because the circle of market
access and mobility produces persistence.
Once a place gets far ahead, it is difficult for
lagging areas to catch up. While agglomeration raises the cost of labor, firms do
not move to low-wage areas, because this
would mean forgoing the benefits of proximity to suppliers and customers.
Concentration is the rule. The strength
of the agglomeration forces created by
market access and mobility depends on

•

•

transport costs, but the relationship is not
linear. When these costs are high, firms
avoid shipping their output long distances
by spreading out their production. Firm
location is then mostly determined by
local access to immobile demand, such as
from farmers and miners. For intermediate
values of trade costs, it becomes feasible
to supply markets from a distance, and
places that get an advantage in market size
build on it and take off relative to other
places. When trade costs fall to low levels,
it matters little whether one sells and buys
locally. Firm location is then determined
mostly by the local cost of immobile features, including the cost of land and housing, but also by the ability to have face-toface interactions or to find a good match in
a specialized labor market. So once trade
costs decline sufficiently, some activities
will spread out in response to cost differences, and others will remain concentrated.
Convergence is the objective. The
forces of market access and mobility
have implications for the way we think
about convergence. The view of development as smooth and linear gives way to a
lumpier nonlinear process. As a country
grows, new producers locate close to
existing production, widening the production differences between lagging and
leading places. When wage gaps become
wide, industry starts to spread to places
that have low wages. But this does not
lead to steady development of all places.
Instead, development takes place in
waves, where some areas or countries are
drawn in sequence out of poverty and are

For one-dimensional problems, a calibrated response would be spatially
blind policies. In areas experiencing
incipient urbanization, for example, the
policy objective should be to facilitate
rising density, and policy makers should
pay special attention to institutions to
improve the functioning of (rural and
urban) land markets.
For two-dimensional problems, the
response should include both spatially
blind and connective policies. For example, in areas of a country undergoing
rapid urbanization, the policy problems

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 41

•

pulled rapidly through the development
process. In the neoclassical world, being
behind can be an advantage—places lagging farther can catch up faster. But with
agglomeration economies, the farther
behind an area, country, or region, the
tougher it is to catch up. What should lagging places do?
Integration is the answer. Because
both high and low trade costs can
encourage production to spread out,
lagging areas, countries, or regions could
in principle turn to either import substitution or export-oriented industrialization. But import substitution becomes
less feasible as a development strategy
over time. Why? Because it limits foreign access to local immobile demand,
whereas export-oriented industrialization
reduces the cost of purchasing foreign
intermediates for processing and export.
The falling share of agriculture and the
tendency of manufacturing and services
to agglomerate have reduced the share of
demand in lagging places. And the fragmentation of production has made access
to intermediate inputs more important.
Both make development strategies based
on fencing off local immobile demand
hopeless. The observation that some
developed countries or provinces industrialized while being closed to trade is of
little help to lagging areas, countries, or
regions today. The ones left behind are so
small relative to the world economy that
isolation is no longer a feasible option.

are not only to facilitate the increase in
density, but also to alleviate the problem
of distance caused by growing congestion. The response includes improvements in institutions to facilitate rising
density as just outlined—and investments in infrastructure to address the
growing problem of economic distance.
For three-dimensional problems, the
response should include spatially blind,
connective, and targeted policies. In
highly urbanized areas of a country,
for example, the problems of density
and distance are compounded by divi-

42

WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 0 9

sions within urban areas, most noticeably between formally settled parts of a
metropolis and slums, where land markets use informal conventions. An effective policy response includes institutions,
infrastructure, and interventions.
At the national level, a similarly graduated policy response can help to integrate
lagging and leading areas (chapter 8), and
at the international level, it can help to integrate poor countries with world markets
(chapter 9).
At all three geographic scales, policy
debates have one thing in common: currently, they begin and end with discussions of spatially targeted interventions.
This Report calls for a rebalancing of these
debates to include all the elements of a successful approach to spatial integration—institutions, infrastructure, and incentives.
This Report takes a long-term perspective, chronicling spatial disparities in
today’s developed economies when they
were at incomes comparable to those of
today’s low- and middle-income countries.
It also systematically documents the relationship between spatial disparities and
development for a large set of countries. In
its conclusions, it makes a sharper distinction between spatial disparities in economic
production and those in welfare. And it
recommends using agglomeration rents in
leading areas to push up social welfare in
lagging areas—and not, except in special
circumstances, to push economic production out to those places.

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 42

At the local spatial scale, the policy objective should be to improve the quality of
urbanization to maximize its growth
effects. Chapter 7 discusses how the priorities of policy makers should change
as urbanization advances. It pays special
attention to land use, where the potential
for market malfunctioning is greatest.
At the national spatial scale, the policy
objective should be to improve the market access of workers and entrepreneurs,
especially in a world in which diminished distance has changed the notion
of markets from local to global. Discussing how policy makers can reconcile the
political objective of national unity with

•

economic concentration, chapter 8 pays
special attention to labor mobility, for
which the potential for market malfunctioning is greatest.
At the international spatial scale, the
policy objective should be to promote
convergence in living standards in a
world in which divisions hamper the
movements of labor and capital. Discussing how developing countries can
gain access to world markets, chapter
9 emphasizes specialization and intraindustry trade, in addition to exploiting
comparative advantage based on natural
endowments. It pays attention to trade
in intermediate goods, which is especially
sensitive to transport costs.

The Report draws on both experience
and analysis to discipline the inquiry in a
policy area as broad and difficult as development itself, and it should be useful for a
wide readership. But the Report is structured to be friendly to readers interested
only in specific aspects of this inquiry:

•

•

The Report has descriptive, analytical,
and prescriptive parts and progresses
gradually from the positive to normative.
Each part is a section of an integrated
inquiry, but each can be read separately.
Policy makers pressed for time can read
just the overview and the three policy
chapters in part three. Students interested
in the world’s spatial transformation can
read just the three chapters of part one,
which provides a three-dimensional tour
of economic development.
The Report progressively widens the spatial scale for addressing the policy questions posed by economic geography, from
local to national to international, with
the specialized reader in mind. Readers
interested in just the policy debate on
urbanization in developing countries can
read just the three density cluster chapters—1, 4, and 7. Those who are mostly
interested in the policy discussion on
territorial development and geographic
disparities within countries can read
chapters 2, 5, and 8—the distance cluster. Readers interested in regional integration can read just chapters 3, 6, and 9
in the division cluster.

Chapters 1 through 9 slice the problem
of economic development into digestible
bites, each serving a pedagogical function. The arguments in the Report are
punctuated with four notes on “Geography in Motion,” which connect the different components by spotlighting the
experiences of North America, Western Europe, East Asia, and Sub-Saharan
Africa. Readers interested in the chal-

WDR09_02_Navigating.indd 43

lenges posed by geography for development—and some clues to how geography
was reshaped—can read these notes on
different parts of the world.

Overcoming Division
Distance in Western
North America
Overcoming
Europe
When Europeans began to colonize beyond their shores, the prospects for economic growth in North America seemed remote. During the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), as the French and British battled over Canada, Voltaire wondered why they should fight over
“a few acres of snow.” They should have been more interested in the economic potential of the Caribbean, where climate and soil
were good for growing sugarcane, and they were. Manhattan was famously traded away by the Dutch in exchange for land around
Suriname. But over time, it has been the few acres of snow and the rocky landscape of Plymouth (Massachusetts) that gave birth to
the “reversal of fortune” between frigid northeastern America and the warmer south.1

o understand how this reversal
happened, one has to understand
how North Americans managed
the growing density, the vast distances
in the continent, and the sharp divisions between slaves and their owners, between natives and colonialists,
between French and English—in short,
how North America’s economic geography has been reshaped.

Size is the most obvious feature of the
United States’ economic geography.2
In 1800 5.3 million individuals lived
on the 865,000 squares miles of land
given to the fledgling nation under the
Treaty of Versailles (1783). By 1900 a
little more than 2 million square miles
had been added through outright purchase, spoils of war, or treaty. Today
the United States has more than 300
million people and a territory of 3.5
million square miles. Since 1790 the
population density of the country has
multiplied nearly 18 times.
The challenges of distributing population and production over such a
vast space are enormous. Both people
and productive land have moved west
and south. In 1800 the population was
centered in Maryland, on the eastern
seaboard (see map G1.1). By 1900 the
center had moved to Indiana. Over the
twentieth century, the center veered

were paramount. The Constitution
and the Northwest Ordinance (1787)
provided the procedural mechanisms
for transforming unsettled areas into
states. Public land was disposed of
through sales to private individuals
and outright grants. Eminent domain
was used to put land to its best use,
especially when required for railroads.

Geography in Motion

The first transcontinental railroad was
completed in 1864. Indigenous populations were removed forcibly, where
necessary, by the U.S. Army. States and
local governments encouraged Americans to move by offering land, building canals, and supplying schools,
roads, and other public goods. These
local governments competed with each
other to attract people and firms, offering tax and other incentives.
People and firms were also encouraged to move by the commerce clause
of the U.S. Constitution, which explicitly prohibits state governments from
engaging in restraint of trade across
state boundaries. The institutional
structure thus permitted the free movement of people (except slaves), capital,
and goods, with attendant property
rights so that movement could occur
without economic loss.
In this policy environment, the
“transport revolution” of the nineteenth
century and growing density permitted a fundamental change in American
economic structures. The combination
of rail, canals, and steamboats vastly
reduced the costs of medium- and longhaul transport compared with wagon
transport alone.3 The country became
more urban and dense, while regional
economic structures diverged. New
England, which had been 80 percent
agricultural in 1800 despite its poor soils
and climate, started to develop manufactures, while the Midwest specialized in
food. By the beginning of the twentieth
century, the United States had become
the largest manufacturer in the world.
The growing density and the migration of people and firms were driven
largely by market forces. Most settlement was cautious. Railroads were built
when (and where) investors thought
they could make a profit and moved
incrementally across the country.
Occasionally settlement did “leapfrog,”
jumping over large expanses of land to
get someplace else, as in California after
the discovery of gold in 1849. But that
simply accelerated the pace of reallocation of labor in America.

WDR09_03_GIM01.indd 45

Convergence in living standards
The American Civil War had longlasting economic effects that divided the
country. Per capita incomes fell sharply
in the South after the Civil War, both
absolutely and relative to the rest of the
country. In 1900 per capita income in
Alabama was still half of the national
average. In 1938 Franklin Roosevelt
famously remarked that the South was
the nation’s “number one economic
problem.” America had its lagging areas.
But the twentieth century experience
was one of steady convergence of living
standards.
In the United States, a clear negative
relationship exists between the level of
per capita income in a state in 1900 and
the income growth in that state over
the next century. That is, poorer states
grew faster than richer states between
1900 and 2000, a phenomenon known
as “beta-convergence.” The main explanation for this phenomenon is migration of people. In the twentieth century,
Map G1.2

the dominant pattern of movement
was from poorer to richer states. Probably the most important example is the
migration of African Americans from
the rural South to the urban North
(and West), beginning in earnest during World War I and becoming a tidal
wave during and just after World War
II. States such as Mississippi and Louisiana now rank lowest in disposable
income, but it is easy to imagine that
they would have been much worse off
without this migration.
Convergence has been aided by
reductions in transport costs. Many of
the most important inventions in transport and communications happened in
the United States. In the twentieth century, the network expanded with the
diffusion of the airplane, the automobile, and electronic communications.
Today, 16 of the 30 busiest airports in
the world are in the United States, and
there are more than 75 automobiles for
every 100 Americans.

The Report at a glance
The invention and diffusion of the
automobile led to the enlargement of
cities through a pronounced “flattening” of urban density as one moves
from the center city to the suburbs. This
helped magnify agglomeration economies, but it also produced social divisions. The U.S. system of local public
finance, relying on local property taxes
to fund services, is poorly designed to
effect income redistribution. Rich and
middle-class households can avoid subsidizing others by moving to new suburbs. Race also plays a role—the central
city is predominantly “black” whereas
the suburbs are “white.”
For better or for worse, growth in
automobiles benefited from the Federal
Highway Act of 1956, which authorized
building of the Eisenhower Interstate
System of highways. In a famous speech,
President Eisenhower recounted how
as a young officer he participated in
the first transcontinental motor convoy
from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco in 1919. The trip took 62 days,
encountering every type of delay imaginable along the way. Today, courtesy
of the system, a driver can cover the
2,819-mile journey in two days. Recent
research shows that the 47,000-mile
network of highways has integrated
formerly isolated rural areas into the
national economy and fostered metropolitan growth.
What have these connections done to
the distribution of population and economic activity? Paradoxically, as the center of gravity moved toward the interior
of North America, the interior—except
for its metropolises—has hollowed out.
Missouri has just 5.5 million people,
more than half of them in the greater St.
Louis area. Spreading out the transport
infrastructure has not spread people out,
but it has allowed growth from agglomeration economies to occur in more cities across the country. The distribution
of population in 2000 is clustered in cit-

WDR09_03_GIM01.indd 46

ies, in the Northeast and on the coasts,
producing what is known as “sigmaconvergence,” a reduction in the income
inequality across states (see map G1.2).
By one measure, the dispersion across
states in per capita income had fallen to
one-third its 1880 level by 2000.

across states; over a decade, more than
a quarter of the population changes
its state of residence. By overcoming
distance and division, and by permitting population and production to
be uneven across space through free
mobility, per capita incomes in the
United States today are both high and
remarkably similar across the different
states.
A remaining challenge for the United
States is the removal of divisions. The
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a step in this direction. But it is a modest step. Consider
Canadian-U.S. market integration. One
study found that trade among Canadian provinces was much larger than
between Canada and the United States,
controlling for distance and the economic size (gross domestic products)
of the trading partners, in this case,
states and provinces.4 Given California’s
size, for example, its trade with Ontario
should have been 10 times Ontario’s
trade with British Columbia, California’s closest Canadian neighbor. In fact,
Ontario’s trade with British Columbia
was three times its trade with California. Even one of the thinnest borders in
the world has a large negative influence
on trade.
Along its northern boundary, the
United States and Canada share 3,987
miles, the longest unguarded international border in the world. The situation
is markedly different along the southern border with Mexico. The border is
guarded—not closely enough for many
U.S. citizens—to keep potential illegal
immigrants from entering. There are
even proposals to build a fence stretching across the 1,933 mile border. Such
barriers are an obstacle to convergence
between countries in the North American continent.

Density, Distance and Division
D
Rising density, falling
disparities, persisting divisions
The long-run economic performance
of the United States is exemplary. Per
capita income growth has averaged
1.8 percent per year for the last 180
years, leading to a cumulative 26-fold
improvement in living standards.
Alongside this growth, income inequality across states has fallen. America has
realized economies of scale—first at
the plant level, then at the local level
as towns specialized in manufacturing,
and later at the metropolis level in the
major urban agglomerations in places
like Los Angeles and New York.
The United States today is composed
of a highly effective set of national markets in goods and factors of production. Place still matters in determining
income, but it matters in the short
run, not the long, and the short run
is much shorter than it was a century
ago. Major local shocks like Hurricane
Katrina have far less impact on local
growth prospects than before. After the
Mariel boatlift brought 125,000 Cuban
refugees to Miami in the early 1980s,
regional wages did not experience a
perceptible impact.
The result is a seeming paradox:
wages in America (corrected for human
capital) are similar in different locations, while economic activity is highly
unequal across space. Europe is lauded
for having lower social inequality, but
North America is more spatially equal.
And it has a more spatially efficient
distribution of economic production.
The reason: a mobile labor force. Every
year about 8 million Americans move

Part One
Seeing Development in 3-D

As the world’s economy grows, people and production are concentrating, pulled as if by
gravity to prosperous places—growing cities, leading areas, and connected countries. As it
did decades ago in today’s high-income countries, the drive to density in low- and middleincome countries can increase the sense of deprivation as the economic distance between
prosperous areas and those left behind widens. And although rapid advances in transport
and communication increasingly bind together geographically distant communities around
the world and open new opportunities for exchange, political divisions that obstruct
the flow of people, capital, and goods remain. Part one of this Report defines the spatial
dimensions—density, distance, and division—and describes their evolution with economic
development. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 show how the economic geography at the local, national,
and international scales is changing, and how the scope and pace of these changes
compare with transformations in the economic geography of North America, Europe, and
Japan when they were at similar stages of development. This broad sweep of stylized facts
informs the analysis in part two and the policy discussions in part three of the Report.

Density

M

ostly off the world’s radar, on
a dusty plain in West Africa,
is a city of 1.6 million people.
Bisected by the River Niger, its two halves—
with about 800,000 people each—are linked
by only two bridges. The pressure of movement is so strong that every morning one of
these bridges is dedicated to incoming traffic: minibuses, bicycles, motorbikes, pedestrians, and occasionally private cars. In the
evenings, to leave the center means joining
an exodus of people toward the minibus
depots. Green vans loaded with passengers
file out to residential neighborhoods as far
as 20 kilometers away. This is Bamako, Mali.
It contracts into its center every morning
and breathes out again in the evening.
With each breath Bamako grows bigger.
It happens to be one of the fastest-growing
cities in the world. Natural demographic
growth is supplemented by migration from
the countryside and other Malian cities. Its
population in 2008 is 50 percent larger than
10 years ago, making it the same size as
Budapest, Dubai, or Warsaw. It has 10 times
more inhabitants than the next biggest
Malian city and accommodates 70 percent
of the country’s industrial establishments.1
New neighborhoods—quartiers—formerly
villages, become consolidated with the rest
of the city, toward the south, east, and west.
Some of Bamako’s people are now moving
out into surrounding neighborhoods in
search of cheaper land and some tranquility, but they remain within reach of the city
because it provides their livelihoods.

Despite its industriousness, Bamako is
one of the sleepier cities in West Africa.
Many of the manufactured staples come
1,184 kilometers by road from one of the
region’s metropolises, Abidjan, which has
more than twice Bamako’s population.
Abidjan seems small beside Lagos, where
activity is so concentrated that its residents
speak of living in a pressure-cooker. Some
families rent rooms to sleep for six hours
and then turn them over to another family that takes their place. Shopping does
not necessarily require travel: goods are
brought on foot and cart to drivers stuck in
Lagos’s interminable traffic jams. To some,
like the authors of Lagos’s 1980 master plan
written when the city had just 2.5 million
residents, the continuing growth of the city
is “undisciplined.”2 What can possibly be so
attractive about living in Lagos that, despite
its congestion and crime, it continues to
draw migrants?
The short answer: economic density.
Lagos is not the most economically dense
city in the world, nor even the most densely
populated. Those distinctions belong to
Central London and Mumbai, respectively. Even so, Nigeria’s economic future
and Lagos’s growth are as inextricably
tied as Britain’s economy is with London’s
growth. No country has developed without the growth of its cities. As countries
become richer, economic activity becomes
more densely packed into towns, cities,
and metropolises. This geographic transformation of economies seems so natural

Density

that—at an impersonal aggregate level—it
is taken for granted. But moving to economic density is a pathway out of poverty
both for those who travel on it and, ultimately, for those left behind. Jane Jacobs,
the noted urbanist, did not have Bamako
and Lagos in mind when she wrote, “A metropolitan economy, if it’s working well, is
constantly transforming many poor people
into middle-class people, many illiterates
into skilled people, many greenhorns into
competent citizens. Cities don’t lure the
middle class. They create it.”3 She might
as well have written: as Lagos and Bamako
grow, they will fi ll in West Africa’s missing
middle.
This chapter introduces density, the first
of the geographic dimensions of development, defined as the economic mass or output generated on a unit of land. Surveying
the evolution of density with development,
the chapter presents stylized facts about
how density in a country rises with urbanization, rapidly at fi rst, and then more
slowly. These changes are associated initially with a divergence of living standards
between places with economic density and
those without, later with a convergence.
Living standards thus eventually converge
between areas of different density, such as
urban and rural. Even within cities, densely
populated slums amid formal settlements,
the differences slowly disappear with development. But this convergence does not happen by itself. It requires the institutions to
manage land markets, investments in infrastructure, and well-timed and executed
interventions.
The main findings:

•

The concentration of economic activity rises with development. The world’s
densest areas or settlements are in developed countries. But the path to these levels, “urbanization” in this Report, is not
linear. The share of a country’s population settled in towns and cities rises rapidly during its transformation from an
agrarian to an industrial economy, which
generally coincides with its development
from low to middle income. The pace of
urbanization slows after that, but eco-

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 49

nomic density continues to increase in
a postindustrial economy because services are even more densely packed than
industry.
Rural-urban and within-urban disparities in welfare narrow with development. In the early stages of development,
geographic disparities in welfare are
large. With development, these gaps
may increase initially. Rural-urban gaps
in income, poverty, and living standards
begin to converge as economies grow,
faster for access to social services, and
faster in areas of more vibrant growth.
Within-city gaps in welfare and housing—most obvious in informal settlements or slums—persist for much
longer, and narrow only at later stages of
development.
Neither the pace of urbanization nor
its association with economic growth
is unprecedented. Today’s developing
countries are sailing in waters charted by
developed nations, which experienced a
similar rush to towns and cities. The
speed is similar, and the routes are the
same. What is different today is the size
of the ship: the absolute numbers of people being added every year to the urban
populations of today’s developing countries are much larger than for even the
most recent industrializers such as the
Republic of Korea and Taiwan, China.
Later chapters of this report investigate
the policy implications of these similarities and differences.

Defining density
Density refers to the economic mass per unit
of land area, or the geographic compactness
of economic activity. It is shorthand for the
level of output produced—and thus the
income generated—per unit of land area. It
can, for example, be measured as the value
added or gross domestic product (GDP)
generated per square kilometer of land.
Given that high density requires the geographic concentration of labor and capital,
it is highly correlated with both employment
and population density. Density is the defining characteristic of urban settlements.

The economic world is not flat
The geographic distribution of economic
activity, at any resolution, is uneven. No
matter the geographic scale examined, be
it the country or a subnational area such as
a province or district, there is a hierarchy
of density. At the top is the primary city,
and at the bottom are agricultural lands or
rural areas. Between them is a continuum
of settlements of varying density.
The geographic unevenness of economic
mass, or bumpiness, tends to increase
with a country’s land area. But even the
economic geography of small countries is
bumpy. The Belgian city of Brussels has
a land area of 161 square kilometers, of
which 159 square kilometers are used for
nonagricultural purposes. On this small
area, a GDP of €55 billion is generated by
about 350,000 workers—that is, the average square kilometer of land has more than
2,000 workers annually producing almost
€350 million of services and goods. Brussels not only has high densities of GDP and
employment; it also has the highest population density of any European (EU27)
area classified as NUTS1 (Nomenclature
of Territorial Units for Statistics)—more
than 6,000 people per square kilometer,
18 times the average for Belgium.4 For the
sake of comparison, the population density of London and Madrid is about 5,000
people per square kilometer.

Map 1.1

This density contrasts markedly with
the agricultural areas of Belgium. In the
Flemish Flanders (Vlaams Gewest) area,
6,323 square kilometers of land are used for
agriculture. Its area is almost 40 times that
of Brussels, but its employment is just 13
percent of Brussels and its GDP a mere 4.5
percent, translating into employment and
GDP densities of only seven workers and
€330,000 per square kilometer. The ratio of
output density between Brussels and Flanders is 1,000 to 1. In between metropolitan
Brussels and rural Flanders is a range of settlements, each with a different density (see
map 1.1). The cities of Antwerp, Brugge,
Gent, and Leuven have an average output
of €22 million and employment density of
342 workers per square kilometer.5
In both developed and developing
countries, then, the economic landscape is
bumpy. But the topography does not correspond to a simple urban-rural dichotomy.
A continuum of density gives rise to a portfolio of places. At the head is a country’s
leading, primary, or largest city. Below the
primary city is a spectrum of settlements—
secondary cities, small urban centers,
towns, and villages (see figure 1.1). In some
countries, such as France and Mexico, the
size difference between the top two cities is
phenomenal. With a population of 10 million, Paris dwarfs second-ranked Marseille
with just 1.5 million. And with a population

primacy” notwithstanding, the “portfolio of
places” is an enduring feature of economic
development.
Settlements of different sizes complement
one another. Metropolises, secondary cities, market towns, and villages are all linked
through their complementary functions (see
box 1.2). The primary city is often but not
always the national administrative center and
the seat of political power: Cambodia’s Phnom
Penh, Cameroon’s Yaounde, and Colombia’s
Bogotá. A country’s leading city also tends to
be its most diversified, both in the provision of
goods and services and in cultural and other
amenities. For the cultural amenities, think of
Broadway in New York City, the Opera House
in Sydney, and the Louvre in Paris. But think
also of Trinidad and Tobago’s Port of Spain,
famous for the annual carnival that attracts
large numbers of visitors.
Just as a primary city forms the core of
a country’s metropolitan area with other
adjacent cities, other large urban centers or

According to a special case of the ranksize rule, known as Zipf’s law, the population of any city is equal to the population of
the largest city, divided by the rank of the
city in question within the country’s urban
hierarchy (see box 1.1).8 As early as 1682,
Alexandre Le Maître observed a systematic
pattern in the size of cities in France.9 For
all classes of country, the relative size distribution has remained stable over time,
even as incomes and populations grew
(see figure 1.2). Concerns about “urban

Although the growth of cities appears
chaotic, the underlying patterns have a
remarkable order (see figure 1.2). A country’s urban hierarchy is characterized by
two robust regularities:

Two laws and a rule: the empirical regularities of a country’s city-size distribution

The rank-size rule, discovered in 1913, can
be expressed as the rank r associated with
a city of size S is proportional to S to some
negative power. The special case in which
the estimated power equals –1 is known as
Zipf’s law, named after a linguist, George
Zipf. Evidence on the pervasiveness of the
rank-size rule comes not only from large
cities belonging to countries of different
income classes, but also from the experience of individual countries. The remarkable westward and southward expansion
of the U.S. urban hierarchy notwithstanding, the rule provides a good description
of the size distribution of U.S. cities for
every decade between 1790 and 1950.a
Indeed, even today, the rank-size rule continues to describe well the size distribution
of U.S. cities (see figure below). This is so
despite evidence that the shape of the rule
has changed over time, becoming slightly
flatter so that the overall distribution of

U.S. city sizes is more even—and that the
rule fails to hold at the extremes of the U.S.
city-size distribution, a common finding
for many countries.b Moreover, the ranksize rule also holds for countries as diverse
as Kazakhstan and Morocco, providing
further evidence of its universality (see the
figure below).
Whether the rank-size rule is really a
rule with underlying theoretical structure
is still under debate. It can be shown to
follow from Gibrat’s law, which implies
that cities grow in parallel.c This is consistent with the absence of any systematic
growth differences between cities. But
this does not imply that policy is incapable of influencing a city’s size and
economic performance. Cities can and
do move up and down their national
urban hierarchies as a result of good
and bad policy choices. And even transitory departures from a parallel growth

path can have important long-term
repercussions for the welfare of a city’s
inhabitants. On whether the power in the
rank-size rule equals –1, so that Zipf’s law
holds, many researchers seem to agree
that, in general, it does not.
The robust message from the rank-size
rule is that, for a given country or area, a
wide range of city sizes coexists. Even the
most developed countries have a portfolio
of settlements of different sizes, ranging
from the small to the large, as opposed to
a single megacity or a collection of cities,
all of similar size. Agglomeration is a balancing act between centripetal and centrifugal forces. The balancing point differs
depending on the sector, the economic
activities, and the type of industries.

secondary cities act as regional foci for both
the economy and society. For example, they
are the local centers for the financial sector,
which serve the areas around them. Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, and Munich
are all home to regional stock exchanges, as
well as local concentrations of venture capital firms.10 Dallas and Atlanta emerged as
regional centers of commerce and fi nance
in the lower South of the United States,
and both host regional offices of the Federal Reserve Bank.11 Large urban centers
and secondary cities also act as local political centers, and provide advanced public
health, education, and cultural facilities.
Hyderabad, the state capital of Andhra
Pradesh, with numerous universities, leading institutes for technical education, and

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 52

private medical colleges, is a seat of learning
in southern India.
These large regional cities are connected
to smaller cities or major towns. The Ruhr
area of Germany, the Randstadt area of the
Netherlands, and the Padang-Medan hub in
Indonesia’s Sumatra represent alliances of cities. Smaller cities within these areas constitute more specialized urban centers, typically
focusing on manufacturing and the production of traditional and standardized items.
Symbiosis is the ruling order: just as the larger
cities help to serve the smaller cities, so the
reverse is true. For instance, the larger cities
depend on the smaller ones for the daily provision of workers through commuting.12
Just as there are mutually beneficial links
between larger and smaller cities, the same is

The Republic of Korea’s portfolio of places

Illustrating a well-developed portfolio
of places are seven settlements in the
Republic of Korea’s urban hierarchy:
Seoul, Pusan, Daegu, Ansan, Gumi, Jeongeup, and Sunchang.
Seoul is at the pinnacle of the hierarchy.
Located 50 kilometers from the Republic
of Korea’s border with the Democratic
Republic of Korea in the Han River basin,
it is the country’s capital and home to
a quarter of its population (that is, 9.76
million people). It serves as the nation’s
political center and cultural heart. Also
typical is its specialization in business
services, finance, insurance, real estate,
and wholesaling and retailing. Overall,
services account for 60 percent of the local
economy. Seoul is also highly specialized
in publishing and printing and in fashion
design and high-end apparel, with the two
industries employing more than half the
city’s 465,000 manufacturing workforce.
Next in the urban hierarchy are Pusan
and Daegu. With a population of 3.7
million, Pusan is the Republic of Korea’s
second largest city. In the southeastern
corner of the Korean Peninsula, its seaport, one of the world’s largest, handles
more than 6.5 million container ships a
year. Daegu is a metropolitan area of 2.5
million, dominated by textile and clothing manufacturing and automotive parts
manufacturing and assembly. Since 1970,
the Gyeongbu Expressway has connected
Pusan to Seoul through Daegu. About 20
flights operate daily between Seoul and
Daegu, and since 2001, the two cities have
been linked by a high-speed train.
Much farther down the hierarchy, Ansan
and Gumi are secondary cities, with populations of around 679,000 and 375,000,
respectively. In Gyunngi province, Ansan
belongs to the Seoul National Capital Area,
as part of Seoul’s suburban area. Gumi is in
Gyungbok province, in the southeast. As
tends to be the case with secondary cities,
Ansan and Gumi are more specialized in

manufacturing, especially standardized
manufacturing, than cities farther up the
hierarchy. Although both cities serve as
manufacturing centers, they differ in their
specializations. Gumi is heavily specialized
in the radio, television, and communication equipment industry, which by itself
accounts for more than 50 percent of local
manufacturing employment. Ansan is
specialized in such high-tech industries as
electrical machinery and computers and
office machinery. It also has agglomerations in several heavy industries: almost
14,000 workers, or 14.7 percent of the local
manufacturing workforce, are employed in
the fabricated metal products industry.

true for smaller cities and towns, and towns
and rural areas. Towns are the connective tissue between rural and urban areas. They act
as market centers for agricultural and rural
output, as stimulators of rural nonfarm activity, as places for seasonal job opportunities for
farmers, and as facilitators of economies of

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 53

At the bottom of the hierarchy,
Jeongeup and Sunchang, both in the
Jeonbuk province, are close to the interface between rural and urban. So while
Jeongeup has a relatively large population (129,050), one in four of its inhabitants is a farmer. Likewise, Sunchang is a
rural town: half of the 32,012 residents are
farmers. To the extent that they exhibit
any specialization in manufacturing, it
is either in traditional resource-related
industries, as in Jeongeup, or in the manufacture of food and beverage products,
as in Sunchang.

care services. Symbiosis is again the rule.
Towns draw sustenance from the agricultural
activity of rural areas, but their prosperity
also spills over to villages by providing nonfarm employment opportunities. Farmers in
Vietnam migrate seasonally to work in urban

construction, returning to invest the money
earned in their farms.13 Farmers in Makueni,
Kenya, use nonfarm income to invest in terracing, planting trees, clearing bush, building
houses, and educating their children. Farmers in the semiarid Diourbel region of Senegal
have responded to growing urban demand for
meat by diversifying away from groundnut
production into animal husbandry.14

interchangeably, agglomeration, density,
or geographic concentration of economic
activity—across countries.
The index identifies an area of 1 square
kilometer as urban, agglomerated, or dense
if it satisfies the following three conditions:

•
•

Measuring density
Measures of gross product at a refined spatial scale, such as a district or a city, are
difficult to come by. Even for developed
countries, output estimates tend to be
available only for rather broadly defi ned
subnational areas (fi rst level and administrative units, such as provinces or states). At
this level, important variations in economic
density are likely to average out. Fortunately
though, as illustrated earlier for Belgium,
output and population density are closely
correlated. Reliable population estimates
are more easily available, even for villages
or townships, because in most countries, a
population census is taken every decade.
The strong correlation between population density and economic mass is consistent
with urban areas being a conglomeration of
consumers and producers, of buyers and sellers, and of firms and workers. For a typical
metropolitan area, the gradient of population density for distance from the city center
is similar to the corresponding gradient for
employment density.15 As implied above, the
extent to which a country’s population lives
in urban areas bears a strong relationship to
how “bumpy” its economic geography is.
Density goes from smoothly spread out to
quite uneven as a country develops. Urbanization is thus synonymous with a tendency
toward greater agglomeration within a country. A country’s urban share is a good proxy
for the proportion of its population living in
areas of high density and, therefore, for the
“bumpiness” in its economic geography.
This Report proposes the use of an
agglomeration index computed using geographic information systems as a measure
of density. Measures of urbanization are
nonuniform across countries, which makes
comparability and aggregation a challenge.
The index allows for a more consistent comparison of the level of urbanization—or,

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 54

•

Its population density exceeds a threshold (150 persons per square kilometer).
It has access to a sizable settlement within
some reasonable travel time (60 minutes
by road).
The settlement it has access to is large
in that it meets a population threshold
(more than 50,000 inhabitants).

Box 1.3 summarizes the rationale and
methodology underpinning the index.
One advantage of the agglomeration
index is that it incorporates both density
and the local distance to density. Based on
the criteria of population density and accessibility to a sizable market, the index also
comes closer to providing an economic definition of an area that can both benefit from
and contribute to agglomeration economies.
Although economic density is both a cause
and a consequence of agglomeration economies, accessibility to this economic mass
from the outer parts of the city facilitates the
exploitation of such benefits to proximity.
This is especially true in the service sector
in which face-to-face interactions are often
necessary. By reducing the need to allocate
valuable land area to residential uses in and
near urban centers, transport infrastructure
facilitates economic density.
Going to work by car or by high-speed
public transportation is a luxury that developed country commuters do not always
share with their counterparts in developing
countries. For any given geographic distance, therefore, accessibility to a city tends
to be lower in developing countries because
of the need to rely on alternative, more timeintensive modes of transportation, such as
walking, cycling, or inefficient public transportation operating on poor-quality roads.
In Mumbai, India, 44 percent of people walk
to work,16 and in Hefei City, China, more
than 70 percent either walk or cycle.17
Such variations in accessibility determine both the shape and form of a city.
When most people walk to work, a city is
more likely to be monocentric and densely

Computing the agglomeration index
adjusted for purchasing power differences between countries—is that it
allows international comparisons and
calculations that aggregate poverty for
regions and the world. The agglomeration index allows the same comparisons
and aggregation.
The methodology underlying the calculation of the agglomeration index can
be summarized as follows:

The United Nations maintains the World
Urbanization Prospects database, a treasure trove of information. It provides
urban shares and population data for
229 countries stretching back to 1950.
But these data are based on country
definitions, which can be quite different.
This Report proposes a new measure of
agglomeration, based on a uniform definition of what constitutes an “urban” or
agglomerated area, using the technique
outlined in Chomitz and others (2007) and
elaborated in Uchida and Nelson (2008).
This should not be read as implying
that World Urbanization Prospects data
are flawed. A better interpretation is to
see the challenge of measuring urbanization as analogous to the measurement
of poverty. Each country has its own
poverty line and criteria to track changes
in national poverty rates. But these measures do not allow reliable comparisons
of poverty between countries, and they
cannot be used to aggregate poverty
for groups of countries. The merit of
a uniform poverty measure—such as
those living below US$1 or US$2 a day,

• Specify thresholds. To be classified as
“urban” using the agglomeration index,
an area must satisfy three criteria based
on (1) minimum population size used
to define a sizable settlement, (2) minimum population density, and (3) maximum travel time, by road, to the sizable
settlement.
• Locate the centers of sizable settlements.
This mapping is done for cities that
meet the minimum population size
criterion using data from the Global
Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP)
human settlements database.a
• Determine the sizable settlement’s border. The border surrounding a sizable

implying that they live close to their places of

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 55

settlement center is calculated based
on the maximum travel time to the
center.
• Create population density grids. These
are created at a 1-kilometer spatial
resolution using two global grid-based
population data sources, GRUMP and
LandScan.b
• Identify the areas. Identify the grid cells
that satisfy thresholds for all three criteria.
• Aggregate grid cell populations. The
result is analogous to urban population. The proportion of this number to
that country’s total population is the
agglomeration index, a summary measure of the proportion of the population living in areas of high density.
In calculating the index, this Report uses
a base case set of thresholds of 50,000 for
minimum population size of a settlement,
150 people per square kilometer for population density, and 60 minutes for travel
time to the nearest large city.
The density and travel time thresholds are those employed in Chomitz,
Buys, and Thomas (2005). The density
threshold is the same as the one used
by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The
threshold of 50,000 for a sizable settlement is reasonable for developing and
developed countries. Many developing
nations have more than 10 percent of
their total population in urban centers
of between 50,000 and 200,000. Some
examples include Chile in 2002, Brazil
in 2000, and Malaysia in 2000, all with
around 17 percent of their national
population living in urban centers of
50,000–200,000 inhabitants. Of India’s
urban population in 2001, 20 percent
lived in settlements of this size.
According to the World Urbanization
Prospects database, the worldwide urban
share in 2000 was 47 percent. Using the
base case criteria, this ratio is 52 percent,
but using 100,000 as the minimal settlement size, it is 44 percent, according to
the agglomeration index. But country
level estimates can be further apart (see
figure at left).

was common. Not until the electric tram was
introduced did this change.
In determining accessibility, and thus the
shape and form of cities, features of physical
geography can also be important. Manhattan
Island in New York City is difficult to get to,
simply because of geography, so it has skyscrapers and a classic monocentric structure,
with half its employment within a three-mile
radius of Wall Street. By contrast, in Los
Angeles, one has to widen the area to a radius
of 11 miles from the center to find as large
a share of employment.18 The implication:
economic density in New York City is $1.44
billion of gross product per square kilometer,
in Los Angeles it is $0.49 billion.19
In the United Kingdom, Stevenage, Basildon, and Crawley are commuter towns that
serve London. About 11 percent of London’s GDP is generated by commuters from
suburban areas.20 Similarly, in the United
States, a daily tide of workers commute into
Washington, D.C., from the neighboring
states of Maryland and Virginia. In 2005 the
net contribution of commuters from these
two states to Washington, D.C.’s output
was $36.4 billion. Maryland’s Montgomery
County—within easy commutable distance
of the district—alone contributed $6.4 billion to Washington’s gross product.21
The biggest advantage of the agglomeration index is its comparability across countries. Here the index has an advantage over
the United Nations’ World Urbanization
Prospects database, which contains the “de
facto population living in areas classified
as urban according to the criteria used by
each area or country.”22 The heterogeneity
across countries can makes cross-country
comparisons misleading. A few examples:

•

•

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 56

India. With the criterion for an urban
area used by Zambia or Saudi Arabia,
defined as settlements with populations
of 5,000 or more, the share of India’s
population in urban areas in 1991 would
be 39 percent instead of the official figure
of 26 percent. This is because 113 million inhabitants of 13,376 villages would
be reclassified as urban.
Mexico. Based on Mexico’s official criterion of settlements of 2,500 or more
as urban, the country’s urban share in
2000 was 74.4 percent. But if the settlement population threshold were to be

•

redefi ned as 15,000 (Nigeria and Syria,
for example, have cutoffs of 20,000), that
share would drop to 67 percent.
Mauritius. In 2000 about a quarter of
Mauritius’s population lived in settlements with between 5,000 and 20,000
inhabitants. Some of these settlements
are district capitals, but none of them
are classified as urban. If they were, the
urban share would have been more than
two-thirds rather than less than half.

At a regional level, according to World
Urbanization Prospects data, South Asia
poses the paradox of being the least urbanized region (27 percent urban) in the world
while also the most densely populated. Using
the agglomeration index, South Asia’s urban
share in 2000 was 42 percent, making it more
urbanized than both Sub-Saharan Africa
and East Asia and the Pacific (figure 1.3).
The World Urbanization Prospects also pose
a puzzle for Latin America and the Caribbean. The urban share in this region in 2000
was greater than that in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia and almost on par with the
OECD’s. The OECD has an average GDP per
capita more than six times that of the average Latin American country. More reasonably, the agglomeration index indicates that
Latin America and the Caribbean’s urban
share in 2000 was similar to that of Eastern
Europe and Central Asia, and 15 percentage
points lower than that of the OECD.
Despite these drawbacks, the World
Urbanization Prospects data are the only available information for comparisons over time.
The agglomeration index is available only for
2000, because time-series data on road networks, necessary to estimate travel time, are
not readily available. So, the agglomeration
index and World Urbanization Prospects database should be considered as complementary
data sources for examining urbanization
and density, and this Report uses both the
agglomeration index and the World Urbanization Prospects data.23 Calculating comparable
urban share measures for at least some countries in the past is possible; going forward, it
should be a priority for all countries.

Economic concentration—

In the early stages of development, when an
economy is primarily agrarian, people live

Density

spread out on farmland. Even the largest
towns and cities are small. Urban settlements
are likely to be small port cities and market
towns, serving the rural needs and trading
surpluses of agriculture. Industrialization
brings with it a rapid process of urbanization—new cities are born, and existing cities
expand. As people crowd into these cities at
a faster rate than their boundaries expand,
population and economic density increase.
Quite early in a country’s development, this
leads to a hierarchy of places.
So, two transitions characterize economic development. The first involves
the movement from a primarily agrarian
economy to a much more manufacturingoriented economy. The second transition,
taking place at a much higher level of development, involves the transformation to a
service-oriented economy. The first phase
of urbanization, which occurs at a faster
rate, coincides with the transition from
a rural to an urban economy. The second
phase of urbanization, at a slower rate and a
much higher level of development, is linked
to a within-urban evolution. In most countries, these transformations happen at the
same time but in different areas.
To measure concentration, we have to
defi ne an area. The policy debate often
involves a discussion of urban primacy,
such as whether developing country cities
are too big or too small. More academic
discussions use a purer geographic notion
of space. This chapter uses both spatial
units—primary cities and the densest grid
cell of 1° longitude by 1° latitude of a country—to measure concentration.

Historically, rapidly rising
concentration, then a leveling off
By one definition, a city is a geographic area
characterized by a concentration of economic actors.24 Globally, the top 30 cities,
ranked by GDP, generated around 16 percent of the world’s output in 2005, while the
top 100 generated almost 25 percent. The
urban agglomerations of Tokyo and New
York have estimated GDPs (in purchasing
power parity) broadly similar to those of
Canada and Spain, respectively, whereas
London has a higher estimated GDP than
either Sweden or Switzerland. Similarly, primary cities in developing countries account

for disproportionate shares of their national
GDP. In 2005, Mexico City contributed 30
percent of Mexico’s GDP despite occupying
only 0.1 percent of its land. Luanda contributed a similar share of Angola’s GDP, while
occupying 0.2 percent of its land. Likewise, the largest cities in Hungary, Kenya,
Morocco, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia—
Budapest, Nairobi, Casablanca, Lagos, and
Riyadh—contributed about 20 percent of
their country’s total GDP while taking up
less than 1 percent of land.25
Density, defined as GDP in purchasing
power parities per square kilometer, rises
with the level of development, and the densest places in the world are in the richest countries. Dublin, London, Paris, Singapore, and
Vienna ranked at the top, in 2005, with more
than $200 million in gross product per square
kilometer. Likewise, Tokyo-Kanagawa, New
York–New Jersey, Oslo–Akershus-Vestfold,
and Vienna-Mödling were the densest grid
cells of 1° longitude by 1° latitude, generating
more than $30 million of gross product per
square kilometer (figure 1.4).
A century of data on aggregate urban
shares, and two centuries of population
estimates for primary cities, suggest that
urbanization is initially rapid before slowing.
Developing countries—especially those in
Africa and Asia—are at phases during which
urban shares increase sharply. People in
Western Europe and North America, which
went through the same phase a century ago,
have understandably forgotten. Emerging
economies such as the Republic of Korea that

developed rapidly provide the best case studies for understanding the pace and pattern of
geographic concentration. Their experience
traces the initially rapid and the more gradual growth of today’s wealthiest nations.
At the aggregate level, using the population shares in urban areas, the urbanization
pattern of developing countries in Asia,
Africa, Middle East, and Latin America
over the last 50 years closely tracks the first
part of the historic path earlier traversed by
OECD countries between 1900 and 2000
(figure 1.5). The urbanization in Asia mirrors the rapid phase of urbanization that
OECD countries experienced in the nineteenth century. Likewise, the geographic
transformations in Latin America and the
Caribbean, in Eastern Europe and Central
Asia, and in the Middle East and North
Africa are qualitatively similar to those
experienced by the OECD in the first phase
of urbanization. Quantitatively, the urban
shares for Latin America and the Caribbean and for Eastern Europe and Central
Asia regions are higher than those for the
OECD at comparable incomes.
This may, however, be an artifact of the
data. Data from the World Urbanization
Prospects database systematically overstate—
purely as a definitional matter—the urban
shares of Latin America and the Caribbean,
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and SubSaharan Africa. The safest conclusion may
be that the pattern of urbanization—the

Africa’s urbanization reflects industrialization

Between 1970 and 1995, the urban populations in Sub-Saharan Africa were growing
at 5.2 percent a year while their GDP per
capita was shrinking at 0.66 percent a year.
Since the work by Fay and Opal (2000),
many have argued that urbanization does
not necessarily accompany development,
with Sub-Saharan Africa in mind (Commission for Africa 2005). But Satterthwaite
(2007) questions the validity of the urban
population numbers in most studies. Since
many were based on projections, some
may have been grossly overestimated.
The problem is the lack of regular population censuses. For Chad and Eritrea the population projections spanning 1950 through
2030 were based on one population census.
Those for the Democratic Republic of Congo
were derived from two observations, the
most recent for 1984. It is thus reasonable
to consider only countries with at least
two censuses during the period examined
(1970–95), a census post-2000 for more accu-

rate population estimates, a population of at
least 1 million in 1995, and data on sectoral
value added for 1970 and 1995.
This whittles the sample down to just 10
countries: Benin, Botswana, Central African Republic, Ghana, Mauritania, Niger,
Rwanda, Senegal, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
Of these 10 countries, five experienced
conflict at least once, and the other five
were peaceful throughout the period. The
results do not appear to differ systematically between these two sets of countries.
The main findings follow:
• Except for Botswana, the countries
experienced on average a doubling
of population, but only 60 percent
cumulative growth in GDP. Population
growth outpaced increases in gross
value added, and GDP per capita fell.
• Urban population growth and total
GDP growth are positively correlated.

relationship between economic growth and
urbanization—is not unprecedented. Even
in Sub-Saharan Africa, faster urbanization
between 1970 and 1995, albeit with negative
GDP per capita growth, was associated with
higher total GDP growth. Urbanization also
came hand-in-hand with rapid growth in
industries and services (see box 1.4).

in total GDP—a doubling of their
economies—also witnessed the fastest
growth in urban population—a fourfold increase. The leaders in the sample
were Benin and Zimbabwe.
• The pace of urbanization was positively
correlated with growth in industries
and services, activities predominant in
urban areas.
These patterns do not support the claim
of African urbanization without growth.
In contrast, countries with higher GDP
growth experienced faster urbanization,
and rapid urbanization came hand-inhand with higher growth in industries
and services. A counterfactual of an Africa
without urbanization is one with even
slower economic growth, greater GDP per
capita losses, and increases in poverty.

At a disaggregated level, the primary
city’s population share of a country displays a similar, nonlinear pattern of initially
rapidly rising concentration, followed by a
subsequent leveling (figure 1.6). This intensification of economic mass within a country’s largest cities is seen for a wide range
of incomes, from Budapest, Cairo, Kuala

Again today, rapidly rising
concentration, then a leveling off
A similarly shaped pattern reappears in contemporary comparisons between a country’s
level of development and the concentration of
density. During 2000–05, the average urban
population growth for low-income countries
was 3 percent a year—faster than uppermiddle-income countries at 1.3 percent and
high-income countries at 0.9 percent. The
relationship is robust. It holds for a variety
of concentration measures, ranging from the
agglomeration index, to population, gross
product, and household consumption density. It is robust to geographic scale: an area
of 1 square kilometer, a city, a grid cell of 1°
longitude by 1° latitude, and an aggregated
urban sector.
Local 1-square kilometer areas. Estimated agglomeration indexes produce a
pattern similar to the historical time series:
rapidly rising density for countries during
the early phase of urbanization (figure 1.7).
This strong positive relationship between

urban share and development holds until
a GDP per capita of around $10,000. This
incipient urbanization is associated with a
rapid shift in the number of people moving
from rural to urban areas. Subsequently,
the pace of urbanization slows and density
levels off as the urban share surpasses 60
percent, and the level of GDP per capita
surpasses $10,000. With only a handful of
exceptions, countries with GDPs per capita
above $25,000 have an agglomeration index
above 70 percent.
Administratively defined areas. Taking individual cities as the geographic
unit, a positive concave relationship exists
between a country’s level of development
and its primacy—the share of urban population living in the country’s primary city, a
widely used concentration measure. Similar
to the relationship between agglomerations
and the level of development, primacy also
rises rapidly before stabilizing during the
latter stages of urbanization (see figure 1.8,
panel a). Population and output density are
highly correlated, but population density
understates the geographic concentration
of economic mass. Agglomeration economies, the benefits that fi rms and workers
enjoy as a result of proximity, make it likely
that output density will increase more than
proportionately with employment or population density.
1° longitude by 1° latitude. Using the
terrestrial grid cells to estimate concentration as the share of the densest cell’s gross
product in the country’s GDP, concentration of economic mass rises rapidly among
countries with a GDP per capita of less than
$15,000, and then stabilizes and tapers off
among higher-income countries (see figure
1.8, panel b).
Urban areas of countries. Concentration measured by consumption, rather
than by population or GDP, suggests the
same concave relationship with the level of
development. For instance, the urban shares
of household consumption in Malawi and
Cameroon at GDPs per capita of $150 and
$700, respectively, are 36 percent and 48
percent. At about 63 percent, the shares are
higher for Jordan and the Arab Republic of
Egypt with GDP per capita of around $1,600,
and rise to 80 percent in Panama and Poland

respectively (see figure 1.8, panel c).26

A portfolio of bigger and denser places
It follows from these stylized facts of geographic transformation that high-income
countries have a portfolio of places with a
higher proportion of large settlements and
a lower proportion of small settlements
than do middle-income countries. And the
middle-income countries have a significantly higher proportion of medium-size
settlements than do low-income countries.
In low-income countries, about threequarters of the population live in small
settlements of less than 20,000 people,
and only 10 percent live in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million people. In
high-income countries, the opposite is true.
Less than a quarter of the population live in
small settlements of less than 20,000 people, and about half of the population live in
settlements of more than 1 million people
(see table 1.1).
At an incipient stage of urbanization,
the portfolio of places in a small country
or part of a larger country, such as a province or even a large district, can be approximated as 75 percent rural and 25 percent
urban, all settlements of relatively low density. As urbanization accelerates—still predominantly a rural-urban transformation
driven by industrialization—and the area
or province grows toward a GDP per capita
of $10,000, its distribution of settlements

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 61

will approximate a 50/50 urban-rural split.
During more advanced urbanization—now
a within-urban transformation in a postindustrial area—the distribution of population can be approximated as 75 percent
urban and 25 percent rural.
This generalization corresponds well to
the experience of the United States. In 1690,
when the average GDP per capita was a mere
$500 (1990 international dollars),27 the primary city in colonial British America was
Boston. With a population of 7,000, however, Boston was by modern-day standards
little bigger than a small town. In the urban
hierarchy, only three other cities had populations greater than 2,500, two of them New
York and Philadelphia. The early phase of
American industrialization brought with it
an increase in the urban share from 7 percent in 1820 to 20 percent in 1860, as GDPs
per capita rose from $1,257 to $2,170 (1990
international dollars). During this time, the
population of the primary city, now New
York, expanded from 123,706 to 805,651. Its
rapid growth allowed the urban hierarchy
to expand and stretch out.

The number of cities with a population
greater than 1 million increased from just
one, New York, in 1820 to nine in 1860. All
these cities were in the Northeast, where
industrialization began. As the geographic
transformation wore on, and the United
States completed its transition to a mature
industrial economy, population density in a
consistent sample of U.S. cities with populations greater than 25,000 increased from
7,230 persons per square mile to 8,876 per
square mile. The average land area of a city
increased from about 19 square miles to 40
square miles.28 Cities became more packed
and more sprawling at the same time.

Convergence—rural-urban and
within cities
A “bumpy” economic geography distributing
production and people unevenly across the
space in a country is a natural feature of the
working of a market economy. This bumpiness tends to become more pronounced as a
country develops. The question often asked
is: what does this do to the geographic distribution of poverty, consumption, and other
living standards? The answer can determine
the political and social sustainability of the
process of concentration.

Rural-urban disparities in well-being—
first wide, then narrow
Rural-urban disparities in productivity,
wages, and well-being can be expected to be
large and increasing in the earlier stages of
development. With the rapidly increasing
concentration of economic mass in a country’s towns and cities in the earlier stages of
development, significant disparities in productivity, wages, and basic welfare occur
between urban and rural areas. The agglomeration of capital, consumers, and workers
quickly brings production advantages, and
transport costs restrict the benefits to the
locality. These larger local markets enable
firms to spread the fixed costs of production
across a wider number of consumers, producing cost and productivity advantages.29
This means higher wages in towns and cities,
and greater availability of a more diversified
range of goods and services.
The concentration of mass also helps to
ensure a better supply of basic infrastructure

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 62

and public health facilities in urban areas.
Along with diverging wages, this promotes
divergence in more basic measures of welfare between urban and rural areas.30 But
rural-urban disparities begin to narrow as
the urbanization process slows, and governments become more capable. The exodus of people and workers from rural areas
to towns and cities reduces surplus labor
from the land in agriculture—and reduces
competition between workers in rural labor
markets. And labor-saving technological
progress releases labor for migration to
urban areas and improves productivity. In
time, investments and fiscal redistributions
give rural residents better local access to
basic amenities, such as a clean daily source
of running water, sanitation, and electricity,
as well as schooling and health care. Indeed,
with development and the passage of time,
a country’s economic geography approximates a “natural” balance that equalizes
welfare between urban and rural residents.
In this situation, people choose to live where
they expect to be best off in material and
nonmaterial well-being. The Islamic Republic of Iran illustrates this rural-urban convergence (see box 1.5).
Evidence from today’s industrial countries suggests that development has largely
eliminated rural-urban disparities. High
urban shares and concentrated economic
density go hand in hand with small differences in rural-urban well-being on a range
of indicators. The 15 countries that joined
the European Union (EU) before 2004, all
with GDPs per capita in excess of $13,000
(1990 international dollars), consider the
unemployment rate an important policy
target.31 But rural-urban unemployment
differences should not be a concern. The
unemployment rates are 10.1 percent for
urban areas, and 9.9 percent for rural areas.
This is also evident for youth: 19.4 percent
in urban areas compared with 18.7 percent in rural areas. The rates of labor force
participation in urban and rural areas are
68.3 and 69.4 percent, respectively.32 For
England, the high degree of rural-urban
equality in well-being is reflected in similar
disposable incomes: indeed, at £522, weekly
disposable income in villages is 10 percent
higher than the £476 in cities.33

Urbanization and narrowing rural-urban disparities in the Islamic Republic of Iran

Rural-urban disparities have narrowed
in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 1976,
on the eve of the Iranian revolution, the
mean per capita household income in
rural areas was 44 percent of that in urban
areas. By 2005, it had increased to 63
percent.
The Shah’s government favored cities
over the countryside. Price controls for
essential foods depressed agricultural
incomes. High tariffs, import bans, and
licensing for industrial goods propped
up prices of manufactured goods and
depressed farmers’ purchasing power.
An inward-looking development strategy
oriented toward final domestic demand
amplified internal migration to Tehran
and a few other large cities. For every
indicator of development, the center performed far better than the periphery. In
1973, the poverty rate was 23 percent in
the central region and 42 percent for the
country. This spatial inequality matched
the nation’s ethnic map, fueling tensions.
What has happened since the commitment in 1979 to address spatial disparities?

• Second, the rural-urban gap in household incomes has narrowed. Between
1976 and 1984, agricultural value added
grew by 31 percent, twice the rate of
the nonoil economy. One reason for this
growth was that farmgate prices rose 55
percent. Another reason was that more
was spent on projects to increase the
productivity of small and medium-size
farms. Growth could also be attributed
to the fact that agricultural production in
the Islamic Republic of Iran is dominated
by the private sector, whereas large
industrial enterprises and service providers were nationalized after the revolution, which hindered their efficiency.

three times higher. But for OECD countries
with average GDPs per capita above $10,000,
the ratio is between one and two (except for
Norway). Given the well-developed fiscal
redistribution mechanisms in OECD countries, and differences in age-demographic
profi les between urban and rural areas,
these disparities in GDP per capita will
overstate rural-urban differences in, say,

The political commitment to spatial
equity has produced mixed outcomes
during the last 30 years: overall poverty
declines and a convergence in ruralurban standards of living, but persistent
differences in interprovincial living standards.

• Third, rural and urban human development indicators improved, even in

For 21 of the 30 OECD countries, the

the lagging provinces. Between 1976
and 1996, the female literacy rate rose
from 17 to 62 percent, while for urban
women it rose from 56 to 82 percent.
During 1994–2000, infant mortality
and under-5 mortality fell fastest in the
poorest provinces.
• Finally, overall poverty has fallen. The
national poverty rate was at 8.1 percent
in 2005, with relatively modest differences in rural and urban poverty of 10
and 7.1 percent, respectively. But poverty rates still vary a lot between provinces, ranging from 1.4 to 23.3 percent.

• First, the share of the urban population
has increased from 49 to 67 percent
between 1979 and 2005. This is a continuation of a longer-term trend: the
urban population had grown by 5.4
percent per year (and in Tehran by 6
percent) between 1966 and 1976.

average levels of personal disposable income
and consumption. The agglomeration index
produces the same qualitative pattern.
Rural-urban disparities in these countries
were wide throughout the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. Wealth per male
adult in nineteenth century Sweden was more
than 200 percent higher in urban areas than
in rural areas, and 150 percent higher in Finland (see table 1.2). Meanwhile, for rapidly
urbanizing England, urban wages were more
than 70 percent higher than rural wages in
the 1830s. France and the United States saw
big increases in the urban wage premium
from 1882 to 1911 and from 1925 to 1935.
Indeed, in the United States, the premium
increased almost threefold in a decade.36 For
developing countries in the nineteenth century, including Australia, Denmark, France,
Japan, and the United States, urban nominal
wages were 50 percent higher.
Today’s developing countries are still
in the first phase of urbanization and,
not surprisingly, have large rural-urban

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 64

disparities in productivity and income.
For a sample of developing countries in the
1960s—among them Malaysia, Mexico,
and Trinidad and Tobago, which have since
reached upper-middle-income or high-income status—urban wages exceeded rural
wages by more than 40 percent. Similar gaps
can be observed in per capita consumption
between urban and rural areas for a recent
sample of 72 developing countries.
The rural-urban discrepancy between
economic mass and population distributions
diminishes with urbanization. Another way
to examine consumption disparities between
urban and rural areas is to look at the population share of a country’s urban areas and
compare it with the share of consumption
in these areas. If this ratio is greater than
one, consumption per capita is, on average,
higher in urban areas than in rural areas,
while the converse is true if the ratio is less
than one.
Rural-urban disparities in consumption fall with density in today’s developing

countries (see figure 1.10).37 In Malawi and
Sri Lanka the ratio is around two: urban
areas account for about 10 percent of the
population but 20 percent of consumption.
For countries with higher levels of urbanization, the spatial distribution of population
more closely resembles that of production.
Madagascar and Tanzania have urban population shares of around 20 to 25 percent and
urban consumption shares of about 30 to
35 percent. By the time a country enters an
advanced stage of urbanization, population
is more or less proportionately distributed
with economic mass, so that the ratio is close
to one. In Chile 85 percent of the population reside in urban areas, and these urban
residents account for 92 percent of national
consumption. In Brazil 80 percent of people
live in urban settlements, and these 80 percent are responsible for 85 percent of consumption. As development progresses and
the concentration of economic activity in
areas of high density increases, rural-urban
disparities narrow. A downward sloping line
at all levels of urbanization is a good omen:
most developing countries may have passed
the peak in their rural-urban disparities.38
What is true for private consumption is
true for basic amenities. Among low-income
countries with urban population shares of
less than 25 percent, access to water and
sanitation in towns and cities is around
25 percentage points higher than in rural
areas.39 But for more urbanized countries,
such as Algeria, Colombia, and South Africa,
the disparity in access is 15 to 20 percentage

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 65

points. For countries where urbanization is
advanced and the urban share is approaching its natural maximum, almost no difference exists between urban and rural areas
in access to basic services. Equalization of
access to basic services can be expected to
promote a corresponding convergence in
nonmaterial indicators of welfare and living standards (see table 1.3).
Narrowing rural-urban disparities is
important, but the progress in absolute
measures of basic welfare in the rural areas
of the world’s poorest countries is even more
important. Rising rural-urban disparities are
consistent with an absolute improvement in

The overall evidence is encouraging. Over
the past decade, most low- and middle-income countries have experienced absolute
improvements on a range of basic welfare
indicators, including infant and under-5
mortality rates, malnutrition, immunization, and school participation in rural and
urban areas. Of 32 low-income countries,
three-quarters reduced infant and under-5
mortality rates and the incidence of severe
stunting and severe underweight, especially
in rural areas.40 And since 1990, school
attendance rose in four-fifths of these
countries, especially in rural areas.41 Both

achieved progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals.
Rural-urban convergence takes place
sooner in more urbanized subnational
areas. In both China and the Philippines,
urbanized provinces exhibit lower internal
urban-rural disparities in incomes (see figure 1.11). In China the entire relationship
has shifted upward over the past decade
so that, in general, rural-urban disparities
have increased over time, consistent with
China’s early stage of development, which
is marked by rapid urbanization. In India
rural-urban gaps in life expectancy were
smaller in the more urbanized states in
both 1983 and 1994. But the entire relationship has shifted downward over time.

and deprivation. Disparities within cities
can be large. In Nairobi poverty is high in
the inner city but much lower in the rest of
the city and the suburbs (see figure 1.12). In
Mombasa, Kenya’s second-most-populous
city, marked geographic divisions in the
poverty rate are evident (see map 1.2). South
African cities also show internal disparities
in the poverty rate. Cape Town has a low
poverty rate in the coastal areas, but a higher
poverty rate in the interior of the city. Similarly, both Johannesburg-Pretoria-Tshwane
and Durban have visible divisions. But the
geography of poverty in Durban is different
from that in Cape Town and Johannesburg:
the poverty rate is, in general, higher outside
the city boundaries than inside.
The most obvious sign of divisions within
cities is slums. Slums have chronically overcrowded dwellings of poor quality in underserved areas. The reason for the lack of basic
public services and infrastructure is the
inability or unwillingness of many urban

governments, utilities, and service providers to operate in slums, generally because of
the informality and illegality of such settlements.42 So living standards, especially
health, security, and sanitation, are lower in
slums than in formal settlements close by.
Mumbai’s Dharavi, believed to be Asia’s biggest slum, has “maybe a million residents . . .
crammed into a square mile of low rise wood,
concrete and rusted iron . . . a family of 12 living in a 90-square-foot room.” In Shiva Shakti
Nagar, again in Mumbai, each community
tap is shared by roughly 100 people.43
The growth of slums in major cities
is characteristic of rapid urbanization.
Because rapid population growth cannot
be satisfactorily accommodated, slums and
shantytowns grow bigger and more visible.
This contributes to wide and increasing
geographic divisions in well-being within
urban areas. Development—both economic
and institutional—and better infrastructure, combined with focused interventions,
eventually bring about a convergence in living standards in urban areas.

Slums are part of rapid urbanization, and
it is not uncommon for a fifth to a third of
a city’s population in a contemporary developing country to reside in slums (see figure
1.12).44 Goiâna, the capital of the Brazilian
state of Goiàs, a medium-size city of 40,000
in 1950, is today a city of more than 1 million, with much of the population increase
accommodated in slums.45 Since 1950,
Delhi’s population has risen more than
tenfold, from 1.4 million to 15.6 million,46
accompanied by an increase in the number
of slum clusters from 200 to 1,160.

Slums, then and now

The term “slum,” probably originating
from an old English or German word
meaning a poorly drained or muddy
place, was applied to housing in the
early Industrial Revolution in the
United Kingdom before the railways
were in place, when canals transported heavy goods along the length
and breadth of the country. During
Britain’s rapid industrialization, most
factories were built beside canals, the
main channel for transporting coal
for their steam engines and other
inputs of production.
Poor workers, migrating to cities
for factory jobs, could ill afford to
walk long distances to and from their
places of work. Before electric trams,
other forms of transport were expensive. So workers settled close to factories. Cheap housing grew around
these factories in low-lying, poorly
drained areas. Housing was overcrowded. Sanitation was inadequate
and in most cases nonexistent. And
air quality was poor, with soot and
other pollutants. Sickness was commonplace. Diarrhea, typhus, respiratory diseases, measles, and scarlet
fever cut the life expectancy of those
born in cities by 12 years compared
with those born in rural areas.
The growing public health hazards
in Britain’s urban slums exacted a
terrible health toll that eventually

reached out beyond the working
class, finally motivating strong political action. But rather than attempting
to stop more workers from coming,
or clearing out these areas of disease
and poverty, the government in the
1870s passed legislation for strict
building regulations, prescribing the
dimensions of streets and houses, and
making it mandatory that all dwellings be connected to newly built
sewerage systems. Major municipal
investments in water works, sewage
facilities, and public health dramatically reduced mortality in Britain’s
cities between 1874 and 1907.
Despite atrocious and filthy conditions, millions of migrants keep
leaving rural areas for the teeming
economic opportunity offered in the
cities of poor and middle-income
countries. Even though health hazards
and mortality rates are far worse in the
shanties around many cities in Africa,
people there are trading, working, and
sending large sums of money home.
The challenge facing policy makers
today is similar to that faced by the
Victorians in London: how to nurture
these agglomerations with functional
land markets, better transport, and
public health infrastructure to capture
the benefits of economic growth.

or Rio de Janeiro’s Rocinha? No, this is an
excerpt from Charles Dickens’s Parish Boy’s
Progress, published in 1838, describing the
rapidly expanding city of London in the
nineteenth century (see box 1.6).
London was by no means the only city
or urban area in nineteenth century Britain
with large slum settlements. Chronically
overcrowded and inadequately serviced
housing was a common feature of British
cities and industrial towns of the time. In
Edinburgh rapid population growth and a
first wave of suburbanization by the thenrising middle classes meant that by the
1860s, the core of the city had a large slum
area with population densities as high as 600
persons per acre. Residents in this area lived

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 68

in multistory tenements arranged along narrow, unlit foot passages. This “housing was
hopelessly inadequate in all respects—in
quantity, in quality and environmental
amenities, if needs as basic as clean water
and safe sewage disposal can be described as
amenities.”47 Apart from the obvious misery, slums were prone to deadly outbreaks of
measles and scarlet fever and high rates of
mortality attributable to diarrheal diseases,
typhus, and respiratory diseases.48
Yesterday’s slums are today’s world-class
cities. Britain is not the only industrial country to suffer from slums and wide intracity
divisions in welfare during the earlier phases
of development and rapid urbanization (see
box 1.7). The stylized pattern of divergence
followed by convergence is a hallmark of
other modern-day developed countries as
well. Slums for these cities are now much a
thing of the past. Aided by improving land
markets, investments in infrastructure, and
targeted incentives, within-city welfare disparities tend to narrow, but only in the more
advanced stages of urbanization. Indeed, for
“world” cities such as London, New York,
Paris, Singapore, and Tokyo, slums can, with
the benefit of hindsight, be viewed as part of
their “growing pains.” Britain cleaned up its
Dark Satanic Mills over a century, and if it
had started the cleanup sooner, the working
class would have suffered from slower wage
growth and lower consumption.49
The emergence and growth of slums in
the early and intermediate stages of a country’s development can be explained by the
interaction of functioning labor markets
with dysfunctional land markets. In the
rapid phase of urbanization, the labor market signals higher labor demand in urban
areas, the higher demand that arises from
growth in industries and services. Labor
responds by moving to towns and cities.
As a reflection of this, slum dwellers in
developing countries are often productively
engaged, taking advantage of the economic
opportunities the city offers. Mumbai’s
Dharavi has 15,000 “hutment” factories,
and “the clothes, pots, toys and recycled
materials its residents produce earn the factories millions of dollars a year.” Many slum
residents started businesses after the state
government provided them with limited

Many of today’s world-class cities were littered with slums

“In Antwerp and in most Belgian towns the
basic problem in matters of working class
housing was . . . no individual sanitation or
individual water supply. . . . The three heavy
cholera epidemics of the 19th century had
terrific effects in these slums . . . “
“The first encampments of Baltimore’s
poor were at the water’s edge. Time and
again, outbreaks of yellow fever, malaria,
cholera, typhoid fever swept the town.
These epidemics seemed peculiarly associated with the low-lying encampments
of the poor. The yellow fever epidemic of
1797, for example, was said to have begun
in the stagnant waters of the Fells Point
cove and to have spread . . . to the huts
and hovels on the banks of the Jones Falls
and thence on to the shacks and shanties
at the foot of Federal Hill.”
“By the 1890s, Polish immigrants had
supplanted the Irish and Germans, creating a ghetto of a new dimension. Single
dwellings housed from six to eight families,
one [family] to a room. . . . Fells Point was
described by a health official as an Augean
stable . . . a mass of nuisance . . . Open
drains, great lots filled with high weeds,
ashes and garbage accumulated in the
alleyways, cellars filled with black water,
houses that are total strangers to the
touch of whitewash or scrubbing brush,
human bodies that have been strangers
for months to soap and water . . . that’s
Pigtown.”
“The slums of Dublin were among the
worst in Europe, rivaled only by Glasgow. Tall town houses, originally built as
elegant homes for the rich in the eighteenth century, fell into the Tomae hands
of avaricious and pitiless landlords who
filled them to bursting point with the
desperate and impoverished urban poor.
Conditions were often unspeakably vile,
with massive over- crowding and utterly
inadequate sanitation.”
“Katajanokka’s transformation in its
entirety from a low-income housing area
to an enclave for the city’s civil service
elite and bourgeoisie represented an
urban growth pattern that emerged for
the first time in the history of Helsinki.
A former slum had become a prestigious
residential area for the privileged classes.”

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 69

“Here the background embraces the
pauper burial-ground, the station of the
Liverpool and Leeds railway, and, in the
rear of this, the Workhouse, the “Poor-Law
Bastille” of Manchester, which, . . . looks
threateningly upon the working-people’s
quarter below. . . . Passing along a rough
bank, among stakes and washing-lines,
one penetrates into this chaos of small
one-storied, one-roomed huts, in most of
which there is no artificial floor; kitchen,
living and sleeping-room all in one. In
such a hole, scarcely five feet long by six
broad, I found two beds—and such bedsteads and beds!—which, with a staircase
and chimney-place, exactly filled the
room.”
“Melbourne’s most infamous slum,
Little Bourke Street, . . . by the 1880s . . . was
crowded, bustling and growing. . . . The
lane is completely filled up with all kinds of
filth comprising garbage tips, putrid liquid,
straw rags, and other rubbish. A most disagreeable odor arose from this offensive
mass . . . the loathsome mass . . . exposed
and allowed to rot and spread its contaminating influences.”
“About 200 years ago, Lower Manhattan was adorned by a pretty five-acre
lake known as the Collect. . . . By the mid1700s, however, the Collect was already
rimmed with slaughterhouses and tanneries. The effusions from these bloody
businesses were poured directly into the
lake and more industries, more trash,
quickly followed. By 1800 the Collect was
a reeking cesspool. By 1813 it had been
entirely filled in and by 1825 something
entirely new stood on the site—America’s
first real slum, the Five Points.”
“Although this is a hugely expensive
area in Paris to live today, in Victor Hugo’s
day it was a slum area, close to the Bastille
Prison.”
“[T]he lawyer Derville ventures into the
slums of Saint Marceau, the poorest section at the outskirts of Paris. Taking his
coach through the filthy rutted lanes, he
arrives at a broken-down building, made
entirely of second-hand materials and
poorly built, where Colonel Chabert is
lodged with the cows, goats, rabbits and
impoverished family of a former regimen-

tal soldier turned milkman, Vergniaud.
There the Colonel lives in a single room
with a dirt floor and a straw bed.”
“Between 1815 and 1851 France’s population grew from 29 to 36 million . . . it was
the cities that absorbed the thousands of
migrants unable to find work in the countryside. . . . But there were simply not enough
jobs. Unemployment and overcrowding created appalling living conditions. Only one in
five houses had running water. In 1832 cholera wiped out some 20,000 Parisians.”
“Like so many other European cities,
Paris suffered from chronic post-war
housing shortages. Of the 17 slum areas
designed for clearance, most were still
intact in the 1950s.”
“One of the worst outrages of industrialism in China against humanity is the
herding of these workers in noisome
slums in the factory districts, . . . so foul
and revolting . . . in Shanghai. . . . There
are no sanitary provisions of any kind, and
the passages between the rows of houses
are practically open latrines. Overcrowding exists to a distressing extent. The
many children who are reared in these
filthy quarters are covered with running
sores from dirt and bodily neglect.”
“In the 15 years between 1930 and the
end of the war, the population of Singapore doubled to a million people. The
population explosion had generated a
housing shortage of epidemic proportions. Small shophouses gave shelter to
as many as 100 people. The average living
space was 9 feet by 9 feet, about the size
of a prison cell.”
“All of the ghettos of the 1920s within
the city of Tokyo were products of Tokyo’s
urban development and Japan’s modern
economic growth. . . . The sheer size of these
ghettos was astonishing. . . . Poverty pockets
re-emerged in all parts of the metropolis of
Tokyo after the Second World War, even in
the midst of the old city of Tokyo.”

rights over their dwellings in 1976 and began
to supply water and power to parts of the
settlement. Because Dharavi is sandwiched
between the city’s two main railway lines
and is surrounded by six stations, it also acts
as Mumbai’s transportation hub.50 In short,
slums arise in many developing countries as
low-income households take advantage of
spatially concentrated employment opportunities and as businesses take advantage of
their location in a land-constrained environment. Consistent with today’s industrial
countries, the correct response is not to
slow, stop, or reverse urbanization. It is to
tackle dysfunctional land markets.
The interplay of such market forces and
responses from rational market actors can
also be seen in many Sub-Saharan African
countries. But inefficient land markets,
often thanks to misguided urban planning and zoning, produce only a limited
and unresponsive supply of affordable, legal
land sites for building housing to keep pace
with the demand.51

What’s different for today’s
developers?
At the beginning of the nineteenth century,
one person in every 10 in today’s developed
Figure 1.13

European countries lived in urban settlements of 5,000 inhabitants or more.52 In this
respect, at least, little had changed from the
previous five centuries. So the takeoff into
urbanization over the next century broke
dramatically from the past.

The pace and pattern of urbanization
is similar
It started in Great Britain. In 1800 Britain’s
urban share stood at 19.2 percent, about
twice the European average. But in the first
two decades of the century, the number of
people living in urban areas doubled. By
1820 the urban share was 40 percent. By the
close of the century, seven of every 10 Britons were living in urban settlements. Britain
was joined in its headlong rush into urbanization by other early European industrializers. By the second half of the nineteenth
century, urbanization spread beyond the
Old World to the United States and Canada.
By World War I, four of every 10 Americans
were living in urban settlements with populations of 5,000 or greater; just 60 years earlier, the ratio was one in 20.
So if anything is different for today’s
developers, it is certainly not the pace of
urbanization. Indeed, the average pace of

Urbanization’s speed has precedents

urbanization for developing countries over
1985–2005 is remarkably similar to the
average for European and North American countries53 between 1880 and 1900 (see
figure 1.13).54 For the early developers the
average absolute increase in the urban share
over the 20 years was 7.7 percentage points,
and for current developers the respective median and mean absolute increases
were 7.1 and 8.0 percentage points. The
pace of urbanization among most of the
early developers in the last two decades of
the nineteenth century ranked in the top
quartile of the contemporary distribution
of urbanization speeds.

The volume of urbanization is greater
for today’s developers
What then is different? One difference is the
unprecedented absolute increases in urban
populations in many developing countries
in recent decades. Today’s developing countries simply have larger populations than
the industrializing countries of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The
urban population today, estimated at 3.3
billion, is far greater than the world’s total
population as recently as 1960. It took more
than 10,000 years for the urban population
to reach 1 billion in 1960, 25 years to add
the second billion, and only 18 to add the
third.55 According to the UN projection, it
will take just 15 years to add the fourth.56 In
East Asia alone, 500 million people will join
today’s 750 million urbanites over the next
25 years, essentially adding another Paris or
Kuala Lumpur every month.
Figure 1.14

Between 1985 and 2005, China added
225 million people to its towns and cities,
almost the entire population of the United
States. Yet China for the same time period,
ranked only fifteenth in its absolute increase
in urban share. In India the number of people in towns and cities rose by 137.8 million,
adding a Germany and an Italy to its urban
areas in just two decades.
Today’s developing countries had an
average increase in their urban population of 8.3 million over 1985–2005, almost
three times the increase for many of today’s
high-income European and North American countries between 1880 and 1900. But
when China and India are excluded from
the group, the average urban population
increase in recent decades has only been
4.4 million, about 50 percent more than
the average for the early developers during
1880–1900 (see figure 1.14).57
Correspondingly, megacities in developing countries are unprecedented in their
size. Through the nineteenth century the
world’s largest city was London. But its
1900 population of 6.6 million was only
a third that of modern-day Mumbai or
New Delhi, the largest cities in low-income
countries. The London of 1900 and, indeed,
even the London of today are also smaller
than modern-day Shanghai (10 million),
the largest city in lower-middle-income
countries, and several others (Cairo,
Jakarta, and Manila) among the more successful developers. With more than 22 million people, Mexico City, the largest city in
upper-middle-income countries, is three

Urbanites today enjoy both higher
private earnings and better public
services
Cities now do better than rural areas in both
income and nonincome indicators of wellbeing. In 2000 the infant mortality rate in
rural Malawi was 117 per 1,000 live births,
in urban Malawi it was 83. Urban Benin
did much better than rural Benin in lowering under-5 mortality rates and reducing
diarrhea and acute respiratory infections.58
Urban Ugandan women were less likely to
suffer from anemia or malnutrition. Superior health indicators are repeated in urban
areas throughout the developing world—
from Chad and Cameroon in Sub-Saharan
Africa, to Nepal in South Asia, Kazakhstan
in Central Asia, and Nicaragua in Latin
America, and to Morocco and Egypt in
North Africa and Middle East.59
But the opposite was true for the developers of the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Migrants to cities could expect
better material standards of living, offset by
poorer health and shorter lives for them and
their children. In 1881–91 life expectancy at
birth was 51 years in English and Welsh villages, but only 44 years in London and 39
years in large towns.60 In 1850s Britain the
infant mortality rate in cities with populations greater than 100,000 was, at 196 per
1,000 live births, far higher than the 138 per
1,000 live births in rural communities.61
Even as late as 1937, George Orwell saw it
fit to characterize industrial towns and cities as places where “one always feels that the
smoke and filth must go on for ever and that
no part of the earth’s surface can ever escape
them.”62 It is perhaps no surprise, then, that
the absence of respiratory diseases attributable to poor air quality in the cities would
have resulted in life expectancies 4.7 years
longer in the England and Wales of 1861–70.
In the absence of cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, and typhus, life expectancy might
have been 1.7 years longer, and the absence
of measles and scarlet fever, common in
the cities, would have added 2.3 years to
life expectancy.63 Thus in the 1830s, while

WDR09_05_Ch01.indd 72

workers in London earned an urban real
wage premium of 67 percent, a large part of
this premium was compensation for the evident health hazards of city living.64
In Germany during the second half of the
nineteenth century, infant mortality rates
in rural areas were about 150 per 1,000 live
births. But expanding Berlin had the highest infant mortality in the Kaiserreich era,
hovering around 300 per 1,000 live births in
the 1860s, and peaking at 410 per 1,000 live
births in the 1870s. The rural-urban gap in
physical well-being remained for decades
during the nineteenth century.65
As the U.S. economy industrialized and
urbanized, people living in high-density
areas at the turn of the twentieth century
were exposed to infectious and parasitic
diseases. In 1880 urban mortality for adults
was 50 percent higher than rural mortality,
and two decades later, the urban mortality
rate was still 18 percent higher. The ruralurban mortality difference was even greater
for infants and young children. For infants,
excess urban mortality was 63 percent in
1890 and 49 percent in 1900, and for young
children ages one to four, the respective figures were 107 percent and 97 percent. In 1900
male life expectancy was 10 years shorter in
urban areas than in rural areas.66
That the cities and towns of modernday developing countries do better than
villages on indicators of health, while the
opposite was true for the developed countries at similar incomes in the nineteenth
century, reflects advances in public health
and medicine, and improvements in sewers
and water systems. It also reflects the public benefits that today’s cities in developing
countries confer. So the advantages of high
density are not limited to income generation and wealth creation—they also include
social services.
With these differences in private and
public sources of well-being, it should
hardly be a surprise that cities and towns in
the developing world are growing rapidly.
The surprise is that this move to density is
not faster. And the policy implication? Any
strategy for a less desperate and more deliberate urbanization must include efforts to
improve public services in rural areas.

eng Xiaoping, generally seen as the
architect of China’s resurgence as
an economic superpower, insisted
on openness to world markets. He also insisted
on concerted development of the country’s
coastal areas, like Shanghai and Guangzhou,
as launching grounds for connecting to these
markets. When asked about the growing
wealth disparities between the coast and the
interior, he reportedly countered, “If all of
China is to become prosperous, some [areas]
must get rich before others.”
This chapter shows that all successful
developers support Deng’s insight. But his
wisdom may have eluded leaders in the
developing world, even the few lauded as
visionaries, as later chapters in the Report
will show. For decades, “spatially balanced
growth” has been a mantra of policy makers in many developing countries. It was an
obsession of planners in the former Soviet
Union (see box 2.5). And it has been the
objective of governments of various political hues in the Arab Republic of Egypt,
Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria,
the Russian Federation, South Africa, and
other great developing nations. There has
even been a strong commitment to spatially
balanced development in the economic
history of many developed countries. The
United Kingdom pursued it between the
late 1920s and 1980s,1 and Canada did so
between the late 1950s and late 1980s.2 But
in these cases, even with the popularity
of these policies, Deng’s insight remained
valid.
Indeed, the concentration of economic
activity and the convergence of living

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 73

CHAPTER 2

standards can happen in parallel. Development in the United States was accompanied
by a rapidly rising concentration of manufacturing activity in a relatively small area
of the northeast and eastern part of the
Midwest at the turn of the twentieth century.3 Throughout this process, U.S. states
witnessed a slow, if sometimes halting,
convergence of per capita incomes.4 Today,
roughly half of the U.S. population is in
only five states,5 but long-term unemployment disparities among states have been
fairly small since World War II.
The convergence of living standards in
the United States has been assisted by the
willingness of workers to “pull up their
roots” and relocate.6 But basic welfare indicators have converged even in countries
where such a willingness has been less evident, because development has been accompanied by the spread of public services.
Take France and Germany. Even though
Paris generates 28 percent of France’s gross
domestic product (GDP)7 using only 2 percent of its land, infant mortality rates in the
country show little spatial variation. The
lagging area of Lorraine had the highest rate,
4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2005, but
this is not much higher than the national
average of 3.8.8 In Germany the leading area of Hamburg—with an economic
density of €114 million of GDP per square
kilometer—enjoyed a GDP per capita more
than twice that of the northeastern lagging
area of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and an
economic density more than one hundred
times higher. Despite the phenomenal differences in economic density between these

areas, there is no difference in basic welfare.
The numbers of physicians and hospital
beds per 1,000 habitants in both Hamburg
and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern closely
track the national averages.9
This chapter presents stylized facts about
economic concentration in parts of a country,
usually called “leading areas,” and the convergence in living standards between households in these areas and those in distant or
disconnected parts, called “lagging areas,” in
the same country. It introduces the concept of
economic distance, which is related to but not
the same as physical distance. When supplemented with the economic density discussed
in chapter 1, distance helps characterize the
spatial transformations that accompany
development and that may be necessary for
rapid economic growth.
The main findings:

•

•

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 74

As countries develop and integrate internally, location matters more for economic activity but less for social welfare.
Greater economic mass (which accumulates where firms carry out production)
and higher living standards (reflected in
household consumption, poverty, and
access to basic services) are not spatially
synonymous. During the early phases of
development, infrastructure and social
services tend to be confined to areas of
economic mass. But as countries develop
and integrate internally, the distinction between leading and lagging areas
becomes sharper for economic mass and
more blurred for living standards.
The spatial concentration of economic
activity first rises and then levels off.
As an economy changes from agrarian to industrial, the spatial distribution of people and economic production
becomes more compact. Within a country, agglomeration and city-periphery
integration give rise to metropolitan
areas and leading areas of dense economic mass. This process eventually
levels off, and the spatial distribution of
economic activity stabilizes.
Spatial disparities in living standards
follow an inverted-U path, widening
in the early stages of economic development, and remaining high for a long
period before slowly converging. As a

•

country industrializes, it concentrates
its limited initial human and physical
capital in leading areas, those with high
growth potential. Areas distant from
the new density lag. Spatial disparities
in productivity and income can persist
for generations, even with mobile labor
and capital. History points to persistent
spatial divergence in living standards in
today’s developed countries in their earlier stages of development, followed by
slow convergence many years after they
attained high income.10
Technological progress and globalization have increased market potential
in the leading areas of developing countries, intensifying concentration and
amplifying spatial disparities. Although
the basic forces shaping the internal economic geography of developing countries
are the same as those that earlier shaped
the economic landscapes of today’s developed countries, the magnitudes have
changed. Larger international markets,
better transportation, and improved
communication technologies mean that
leading areas in open developing countries have greater market potential than
industrial countries did in their early
development. So the forces for spatial
divergence between leading and lagging
areas are now stronger.

Defining distance
Density, discussed in chapter 1, is also relevant at the country level. Denser concentrations of economic activity increase choice
and opportunity. They ensure greater market potential for the exchange of goods,
services, information, and factors of production. This chapter examines the disparities in economic mass and welfare between
areas within countries, linking these disparities to the distance from economic density. So while chapter 1 discussed changes
at the local scale—where the most relevant
spatial dimension is density—this chapter
addresses the spatial transformations at the
country scale, where both density and distance are relevant. Chapter 3 will propose
that although density and distance also
matter for world regions, the most important dimension at the international scale is

Distance

division—political barriers to the flows of
goods, entrepreneurship, people, and information between nations.

As the crow flies? Distance as an
economic, not Euclidean, concept
Distance refers to the ease or difficulty for
goods, services, labor, capital, information,
and ideas to traverse space. It measures how
easily capital flows, labor moves, goods are
transported, and services are delivered
between two locations. Distance, in this
sense, is an economic concept, not just a
physical one. Although economic distance
is generally related to Euclidean (straightline) distances between two locations and
the physical features of the geography separating them, the relationship is not always
straightforward. One reason is that distance
for the exchange of goods is different from
that for the migration of people.
For trade in goods and services, distance
captures time and monetary costs. The
placement and quality of transport infrastructure and the availability of transport
can dramatically affect the economic distance between any two areas, even though
the Euclidean distance between them
could be identical. Two villages may have
the same straight-line distance to a city,
but one could be near a national highway,
the other on an unpaved rural road. Based
on straight-line distance, most of India is
Map 2.1

well connected to markets in dense settlements. But people in many parts of India
have difficulty getting to markets because
of the travel time, determined by the type
and quality of roads and other transport
infrastructure (see map 2.1).
For labor mobility, distance also captures
the “psychic costs” of separation from familiar territory. Between 1985 and 1995, the
share of migrants in a Chinese province originating from another province fell as distance
between the provinces increased. And additional costs exist for migration between nonneighboring provinces.11 So, as with trade,
economic distance for migration is related to,
but not synonymous with, physical distance.
In this Report, the destination of interest is a
location with the greatest economic density
or highest market potential. Distance is thus
a metaphor for access to markets.
Manmade barriers, including policies,
can also increase distance. Roadblocks and
local barricades—improvised “toll stations” for local police and others to extract
payments—are common for journeys by
road in many Sub-Saharan countries.12
And where local political autonomy is
high, there may be territorial fragmentation as policies of protection are pursued
at the local level. Map 2.2 shows the time
to human settlements, assuming few or no
manmade barriers. Distances can be long,
even in high-income countries.

Locations close to markets have
a natural advantage
Provincial governments in 1980 in China
heightened their administrative powers
under decentralization reforms. They used
these powers to protect local firms—raising
tariffs and imposing bans on shipments from
other provinces. Imports between provinces
fell from 50 percent of GDP to 38 percent
between 1992 and 1997, while local absorption of goods within provinces rose from 68
percent to 72 percent. The magnitudes are
similar to those for goods crossing the U.S.Canada border and international borders in
the European Union (EU).13 China’s hukou
system of permanent household registration—linking place of residence with access
to consumer goods, employment opportunities, and social protection—similarly
reduced internal migration.14
Distance to density affects spatial
movements in goods, services, information, knowledge, and people. Commuting,
migration, telecommunication, information flows, and shipments of goods connect
originating and receiving areas. Most spatial interactions, such as learning and trade,
are beneficial. But some are harmful, such

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 76

as the spread of disease. The main determinant of the strength of these interactions is
distance. Waldo Tobler’s First Law of Geography states that “everything is related to
everything else, but near things are more
related than distant things.”15 Areas closer
to economic density have easier access to
beneficial interactions and exchanges.
In Indonesia better road connections
shorten travel time and the distance to economic centers, creating larger agglomerated areas. Because of good roads and easier
access to markets, villages 60 kilometers
from the district center generate as much
manufacturing activity as the district center itself, and the well-connected periphery
becomes part of the agglomerated area. But
in poorly connected peripheries, the density
of economic activity falls off rapidly beyond
25 kilometers from the center (figure 2.1).
Spillovers from proximity to density show
up in both developed and developing countries. In European manufacturing, an area’s
total factor productivity growth is positively
and significantly related to the density of
manufacturing production in neighboring
areas. And faster demand growth in neighboring areas stimulates, through spillovers,

faster total factor productivity growth.16
In Canada, North York and Waterloo are,
thanks to proximity and local research
universities, becoming an extended part of
the Toronto information and communication technology (ICT) hub. Firms closer to
Toronto do better than those farther away.17
The phenomenon is repeated in emerging economies. When a network of highways surrounding Jakarta was built in the
1980s, many firms moved out of the center
to save on land and congestion costs. But
they stayed near the metropolitan region
to have access to the large market.18 Similar
but less pronounced is the pattern in other
Indonesian agglomerations, where growth
has been strongest in peripheral areas surrounding megacities.19 In Brazil industries moved out of greater São Paulo to the
lower-wage populated periphery. Following
the transport corridors, these industries
moved through São Paulo state and into
the neighboring state of Minas Gerais. In
the Republic of Korea the early decentralization of manufacturing from Seoul was to
peripheral locations within an hour’s drive.
Only in the 1990s did industries decentralize to towns and rural areas.20

The natural way to reduce distance is
for people to migrate
A leading area of dense economic activity,
through its market opportunities, creates
incentives for firms and workers to move

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 77

there. Responding to these incentives, firms
and workers enlarge the market opportunities available in the dense area. The result is
a circular and cumulative process of dense
areas continually gaining workers and firms
from less dense areas. In this process, migration balances the distribution of population
against the spatial disparity in economic
density. Reducing distance-related costs or
spatial frictions increases movements of
people, firms, and ideas—as well as those
of goods and services—and thus brings less
developed areas into the national system of
production. With trade, the mobility of people is probably the most potent mechanism
for integrating areas of low economic density
with markets of high density. But for internal migration to bring about a convergence
in living standards, large population movements may be necessary over generations.
Every year, approximately 40 million
people in the United States change residences, and 8 million people change states.21
The reason for this mobility is that economic
production is concentrated in a few parts of
the country, and accessing this economic
density generally means moving closer to it.
People moving to economically dense
areas contribute to production and boost
their incomes. But they also increase competition among workers in dense areas,
reducing it in less dense areas, and contributing to the convergence of living standards
between low- and high-productivity areas.

Among today’s industrial countries, the
quickest convergence occurred between 1870
and 1913, largely driven by the largest flows of
people from Europe to emerging markets in
Asia and the Americas. For Ireland between
1851 and 1908, mass outmigration contributed at least a third to the catch-up in Irish
real wages with those in the United States
and Britain—by reducing competition in
the domestic labor market. The virtual cessation of catch-up or convergence among the
industrial countries between the two world
wars was attributed largely to more restrictive immigration policies.22,23

criteria that correspond to fairly selfcontained labor markets and zones of economic activity. But data on such functionally
defined economic areas are hard to come
by.24 So subnational areas are more commonly defined by administrative or political
boundaries. Such definitions can bias econometric analysis (see box 2.1), but they have
the advantage of corresponding to the areas
for defining and implementing subnational
policy. This chapter examines administratively or politically defined areas based on
different data sources, ranging from national
accounts and household surveys to terrestrial
grid cells of 1° longitude by 1° latitude.
In this Report, leading areas have a high
economic density, and lagging areas have a
long distance-to-density. An area is more
likely to be lagging the farther it is from

B OX 2.1

Defining an area: impossible or NUTS?

Subnational policy analysis relies on data
for areas that range from small primary
sampling units to districts, and to states
or provinces. Typically, these areas are
defined administratively or politically,
reflecting historical characteristics more
than current patterns. For instance, the
existing administrative structure of the
EU’s member states generally consists
of two levels, such as länder and kreise
in Germany, regions and départements in
France, comunidades autónomas and provincias in Spain, and regioni and provincie
in Italy. The Nomenclature of Territorial
Units for Statistics (NUTS) provides a single
uniform classification of territorial units
for producing regional statistics for the
EU. The first two administrative levels
in most member states correspond to
NUTS 2 and NUTS 3. NUTS 1, a larger unit
representing the major socioeconomic
regions, often does not correspond to
existing administrative units within member states.
Which spatial scale to use, or how best
to define a subnational area, depends on
the issue and the information available.
But the choice can dramatically affect the
conclusions drawn from studying social
and economic conditions across different
parts of a country—for two reasons.
• First, areas are not defined keeping in
mind the policy issues. For instance,

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 78

within-area differences in employment or poverty can be as large as
between-area differences. Any change
in the boundaries between areas
could change the results. The potential
implications are succinctly summarized by the title of a classic paper on
this topic, “A Million or So Correlation
Coefficients.”a
• Second, analytical findings depend on
the aggregation or spatial scale, the
ecological fallacy of inferring characteristics of individuals from aggregate
data. The classic study by Robinson
(1950) illustrates this problem.b A broader
aggregation will yield smaller differences
between units of analysis—and lower
variances. So, results can differ significantly depending on the size of the units.

The figure below shows the density of
economic activity for Germany’s 16 provinces (länder) and 439 districts (kreise).
The highly aggregated data indicate that
30 percent of GDP is produced on 10 percent of the country’s area, and the more
disaggregated data show that almost 60
percent of GDP is produced on the same
10 percent. Aggregate information can be
useful, but be mindful of these biases.

leading areas because greater distance-todensity implies a lack of integration into the
economy of leading areas. It also implies
poorer access to the “thick” markets of capital, labor, goods, services, and ideas, and the
spillovers of knowledge and information they
provide. A lagging area is usually a remote
part of the country with one or more of the
following features: high poverty, low productivity and income, high unemployment,
and stagnant growth, which are typically the
criteria governments use to define lagging
areas.
In developing countries, lagging areas
tend to be remote places where basic needs,

How developed and developing countries define lagging areas: a quick survey

In this Report, a lagging area is defined
as a place distant from density. How does
this definition compare with how policy
makers in developing and developed
countries have, today and historically,
defined lagging areas?
Usually, the criteria national governments use to classify an area as “lagging,”
“disadvantaged,” or “backward” are linked
to explicit strategies or policies for spatial
or regional development. The criteria
might be vague or precise. They might
relate to a single indicator of economic performance or to a weighted average of several. And they might reflect the definition
of lagging areas at different spatial scales.
• Vague. UK regional policy in the 1980s
classified a lagging area as being either
a “development area” or an “intermediate area.” But the law was vague in the
criteria it set to designate such areas.
“In exercising his powers under the
preceding provisions of this section [in
the designation of development and
intermediate areas] the Secretary of
State shall have regard to all the circumstances actual and expected, including
the state of employment and unemployment, population changes, migration
and objectives of regional policies.”a
• Precise and simple. EU regional or “cohesion” policy for the period 2007–13
defines lagging areas as those qualifying for assistance under the “convergence objective,” equated with NUTS2
areas with a GDP per capita of less
than 75 percent of the EU average.b
These areas are budgeted to receive

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 79

such as access to sanitation and electricity,
are not met. In developed countries, lagging
areas are locations with poorer job prospects than leading areas, but no differences
in basic welfare. So distance and market
access, in this Report, capture a wide range
of criteria that different countries use to
define a lagging area (see box 2.2).
It follows that distance-to-density is the
cause of low income per capita, labor productivity, and real wages—and of the high
rates of poverty and unemployment. In the
United Kingdom, economic density in the
leading London and southeast areas produces a wage premium of 18 percent, which

around 71 percent of funds under the
convergence objective. But, even in EU
regional policy, funding is available on
more favorable (and complicated) terms
for those areas whose GDP per capita
is not only less than 75 percent of the
EU average, but which are in a country
whose GDP per capita is less than 90
percent of the EU average. These areas
are considered to be “more lagging.”c
• Precise and complicated. Between 1982
and 1987 Canada’s Department of
Regional Industrial Expansion used a
development index to classify areas
for allocations under its Industrial and
Regional Development Program. The
index assigned a 50 percent weight to
an area’s unemployment, a 40 percent
weight to its personal income, and a 10
percent weight to the fiscal capacity of
the province to identify 15 percent of
the “least developed.”d
• Sophisticatedly defined and measured.
To identify areas considered as lagging, Mexico’s microregional strategy
uses a “marginalization index” based
on indicators of access to such basic
services as electricity and drinking
water, and indicators of the quality of
dwelling conditions and the proportion
of the local working population that
is poorly paid.e It is mainly targeted
at remote rural communities in the
south, because the “remoteness of
rural communities often translates into
conditions of poverty and a substantial
lack of access to a wide range of basic
public services.”f

Mexico is noteworthy not only because
of the sophistication of the measure used
to identify lagging areas, but also because
of the sophisticated manner of defining
areas. Rather than using crude administrative boundaries to define areas, geographical information system (GIS) techniques
are used to consider an area’s geographical proximity, ethnic and cultural identity,
and geoeconomic characteristics.
So the criteria that different countries
use to identify lagging areas depend on
the level of development and on domestic political considerations. High levels of
poverty and marginalization define lagging areas in developing countries, and a
high rate of unemployment often defines
them in developed countries.
India’s 10th Five-Year Plan (2002–07)
identifies the northeastern region as
“backward” and “disadvantaged” and
thus deserving special policy attention.
EU regional policy, under its convergence
objective, makes special provisions for
“the outermost regions,” deemed to
require additional assistance.
This Report’s definition of lagging
areas—as distant from density—captures
this wide range of criteria.

distant areas in the north and southwest of
England and in Scotland and Wales do not
enjoy.25 In Indonesia the potential profitability of firms in textiles and other sectors
is negatively related to distance-to-density:
more distance, less profit. This is true for
distance-to-density within the country and
for distance to an international port and
thus to the density in international markets.26 Again, lagging areas unable to attract
investment and employment are those with
a high distance-to-density.
As in today’s rich countries, distance-todensity affects incomes in emerging market countries. In China good market access
produces higher individual wages, even
after controlling for individual, sector-, and
province-specific attributes, living cost differences, and human capital externalities.27

Dangerous disparities: when divisions aggravate distance

The academic literature argues that internal labor migration is the strongest force
for convergence in economic and other
measures of household welfare across
areas of a country. But differences in language, religion, ethnicity, and race are
probably one of the strongest barriers to
internal migration, a troubling dilemma for
policy makers. The ethnic, linguistic, and
religious barriers that may keep households from taking advantage of many
opportunities to arbitrage geographic
differences for employment and earnings
can be the same barriers that cage poor
people in lagging areas, perpetuate their
poverty, and sharpen spatial disparities.

are persistently worse in West Kalimantan—home to such ethnic minorities as
the Dayak, Bugis, and Sambas—than in
Java, home to Indonesia’s ethnic majority.
Disparities in South Asia. In India

have lower wages, and improving an area’s
growth prospects largely depends on reducing distance.28 In Brazil’s leading area, economic density implies a wage premium of
13 percent, comparable to that in European
countries.29,30 In Mexico the southern rural
areas—distant from the economic density
in Mexico City and the United States—have
the lowest wages and highest poverty.
Lagging areas in many countries are
home to ethnic minorities. Tribal, racial,
and religious differences in access to
resources show up as spatial disparities. In
a vicious cycle, disparities between areas
that coincide with different ethnic groups
can deepen political divisions and fuel
tensions, contributing to greater divergence in living standards. They can even
fuel civil confl ict that is difficult to extinguish, causing “development in reverse”
(see box 2.3).31

Sikkim, and Tripura make up the lagging
northeast. Except for the Assamese,
the population is predominantly tribal,
speaks Tibeto-Burman and Austro-Asiatic
languages, and has a strong genetic similarity with the people of East Asia. Hinduism is the dominant religion, but the
proliferation of Christianity has set the
area apart from the rest of India. By conventional measures of economic welfare
and development, northeastern states
rank among the lowest in India.
Disparities in Africa. A study of 11
Sub-Saharan countries found that ethnicity was on its own a strong predictor of
differences in child mortality, but when
combined with geography, it continued
to predict the probability of survival
among children. For instance, in Côte
d’Ivoire, mortality among two year olds
fell much faster from 1970 to 1994 for the
Baoule than for other ethnic groups. Children of Ashanti women in Ghana were
about 20 percent less likely to die than
other children. In Uganda, Baganda children under five were a third less likely to
die than children of other ethnic groups.
A 2005 study on spatial inequalities
by the World Institute for Development

Economics Research at the United Nations
University in Helsinki (UNU-WIDER) conjectured that “Spatial inequality is a dimension of inequality overall, but it has added
significance when spatial and regional
divisions align with political and ethnic
tensions to undermine social and political
stability.”a These somewhat abstract words
chillingly foreshadowed the violence in
Kenya in early 2008, which left 1,500 people dead and another 250,000 displaced.
Violence began over the disputed outcome
of a presidential election in late December
2007, quickly exposing deep ethnic cleavages that demarcate Kenya’s economic and
political geography. Communal fighting
was most pronounced around the town
of El Doret in the Rift Valley, and on the
outskirts of Kisumu in the Western district
of the country. The Rift Valley and Western
districts are among Kenya’s economically
lagging areas and are the traditional home
places of the minority Kalenjin, Luo, Kisi,
and Luhya tribes, who along with other
ethnic minorities in these areas harbor
resentments related to economic deprivation and neglect.

Lagging areas have higher poverty rates,
leading areas have more poor people

Economic concentration in leading
areas

The rate of poverty (the poverty headcount) is related to distance, and the mass
of poverty is related to density. Lagging
areas tend to have a higher proportion of
poor residents, and the leading areas tend
to contain a higher share of the country’s
poor people, because of the dense population in leading areas. Vietnam’s lagging
inland areas have the highest poverty rate,
but its prosperous leading areas contain
the mass of poor people (see map 2.3).
And in Honduras the country’s poverty
mass is concentrated in its two leading
areas of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula,
while distant eastern areas generally have
a high poverty rate (map 2.4).

As economies develop, economic activity generally becomes more concentrated, not less.
In about a quarter of the world’s nations—
such as Botswana, Brazil, Norway, Russia, and
Thailand—more than half of national income
is generated on less than 5 percent of the land
area. In half of all nations—such as Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, and Zambia—a
third or more of national income is generated
on less than 5 percent of land. Only one country in 10 has a dispersed economic mass, with
less than a tenth of national income generated
on 5 percent of its land. Among the few countries with this high spatial dispersion: Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Korea, the
Netherlands, and Poland. 32

This section presents the historical experience of selected industrialized countries.
Spanning more than a century, this section
shows how these countries experienced
rapidly rising spatial concentrations, followed by a leveling off. It then turns to a
large sample of developed and developing
countries to document how the concentration of economic mass rises with a country’s development.

Rapidly rising concentration in the early
stages of development, then a leveling
It is difficult to come by data that track the
evolution of spatial concentrations of economic activity.33 The information available
reveals that economic development, in its
early stages, is accompanied by a rapidly rising
spatial concentration in a country. Not only
does the volume of economic activity grow,
but its generation becomes more compressed
into a smaller land area. Leading areas benefit
most from this compression and growth.
Economic concentration in the Ile de
France—the leading area of France, with
about 2 percent of the country’s land—increased rapidly from a value of around two
times the hypothetical share in 1801 to three
times in 1851 and to six times by 1910.34 It
continued to rise, but less rapidly, to nine
times that share in 1960. French GDP per
capita grew from less than $1,000 in 1801
to $7,000 in 1960. From 1960 on, however,
its economic concentration stabilized, even
though its GDP per capita tripled. In Canada and the Netherlands the increases were

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 82

not as dramatic, but both countries experienced the same pattern of rapidly rising
concentrations at low levels of development,
followed by a leveling off as GDP per capita
rose past $10,000 (see figure 2.2).35
Patterns are similar in today’s developing
countries. As Thailand industrialized and
grew rapidly, the concentration in the leading
Bangkok metropolitan area increased from
1.8 in 1975 to 3.1 in 2004, while GDP per capita increased fourfold. In Brazil too, the concentration in the leading São Paulo area edged
upward from 7.3 in 1960 to 8.4 in 2004, as the
country’s GDP per capita almost tripled.
For Japan during its post–World War II
industrialization, the concentration in its
leading area of greater Tokyo increased from a
high of 7.1 in 1955 to about 8 in 1970 as its GDP
per capita more than doubled. This increasing
spatial concentration eventually levels off, as
the spatial distribution of economic activity
in a country stabilizes. After 1970, the concentration in greater Tokyo stabilized.
In the United States as GDP per capita
rapidly increased from $1,806 in 1850 to
$4,091 in 1900,36 concentration came in
the manufacturing belt of Green Bay– St.
Louis–Baltimore–Portland ME, which
accounted for three-quarters of U.S. manufacturing employment. Over the next 60
years, the belt’s share of manufacturing
employment remained stable at two-thirds
to three- quarters. 37 Despite structural
changes in the U.S. economy and shifting
patterns of economic concentration, that
concentration remained stable after 1960.

Population Database, Human Settlements Group, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).

Another corroborative piece of evidence of
rising concentration comes from the falling
share of land area occupied by 80 percent of
the U.S. population in the densest counties
from 25 percent of the U.S. land areas in
1900 to 17 percent in 2000.38
As countries grow beyond $10,000 GDP
per capita, concentration tends to stabilize,
with the details differing. The concentration in the leading area is greater in Canada,
France, and Japan than it is in the Netherlands and the United States. For developing countries too, Brazil, Indonesia, and
the Philippines seem to be on paths toward
greater spatial concentration than either
Chile or Thailand.

International comparisons of
concentration today support
historical trends
The relationship between a country’s development and its spatial concentration holds
for countries at different levels of development. It holds for countries based on administrative areas (Canadian provinces, Japanese
prefectures, Russian oblasts, and U.S. states),
statistical areas (the nine census regions of
the United States, the three regions in Ecuador), and land areas (terrestrial grid cells of
1° longitude by 1° latitude). And it holds for
different measures of concentration.
Administrative areas. Different
countries have different numbers of

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 83

administrative areas, which may be of different geographic sizes. But controlling for
these factors, a comparison of 24 developing countries—ranging from Mozambique
with a GDP per capita of $211 to Greece
with more than $12,000—reveals the same
pattern as the historical experiences of
Canada and France. The share of national
GDP produced in the leading administrative area tends to increase with the level of
development (see figure 2.3, panel a).
Statistical areas. Statistical areas, broad
census regions, can differ from administrative areas. The United States has nine statistical areas but 50 states; Canada has five
statistical areas but 10 provinces and three
territories. A country’s statistical office generally uses these areas to stratify its sampling frame for household surveys, with the
areas corresponding to the geographic partitions of a country such as east and west.39
Despite the difference in aggregation, the
data for statistical areas suggest the same
relationship between concentration, measured by consumption rather than GDP,
and development (see figure 2.3, panel b).
Land areas. Terrestrial grid cells of 1°
longitude by 1° latitude, each corresponding to a land area of 100 square kilometers
can provide purer geographic resolution.40
Spatial concentration within a country can
then be measured as the share of national
GDP generated on the densest 5 percent of

its land.41 The stylized pattern of rising concentration of GDP with development using
historical data is the same as that using contemporary data. The relationship between
development and economic concentration is
positive and roughly linear when comparing
developing countries with a GDP per capita of
less than $10,000. But this relationship starts
to level off when higher-income countries are
included in the sample (figure 2.3, panel c).
The rising concentration of production
with economic development is not an artifact
of the number of subnational areas across
countries or of the different sizes of land area
in the countries (see table 2.1). Consider Tanzania, Italy, France, and Sweden, with similar
numbers of administrative areas (21 or 22).
Tanzania’s leading area of Dar-es-Salaam
generates 15 percent of national GDP, Italy’s
leading area of Lombardia, 21 percent. France
and Sweden, each with a higher GDP per capita than Italy, also have higher concentrations
in their leading areas.
For a set of countries partitioned into
five statistical areas—ranging from Argentina to Tajikistan—the concentration of
consumption in the leading area increases
with development. Among medium-size
countries with about 300,000 square kilometers of land area, Ghana and Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (both low-income
countries) have markedly lower spatial
GDP concentrations measured by spatial
Gini coefficients 42 than Poland (a lower-

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 84

middle-income country) and New Zealand
(a high-income country). Poland and New
Zealand have lower spatial Gini coefficients
than richer Norway and the United States.
The pattern also holds for small and large
countries.

Divergence, then convergence—
between leading and lagging areas
When production is primarily agrarian,
economic activity tends to be evenly distributed across space. Productivity differences
are also moderate, varying naturally with
soil quality and climate. But as an economy
develops and production expands in manufacturing and services, some areas become
more attractive to firms and workers. Some
are endowed with natural or “first nature”
geographic advantages.43 For example, a
strategic coastal location makes an area a
natural choice for a port (as with New York
and Philadelphia in the United States). For
others areas not so blessed by nature, their
economic pull might be linked to a “second
nature” historical accident. An example is
Boston, saved from economic decline by an
influx of immigrant labor fleeing the Irish
potato famine. For Irish immigrants it was
cheaper to travel from Liverpool to Boston
than to New York.
Economic development brings with it
greater market integration, which facilitates
the mobility of people and capital and allows
for greater trade, forces benefiting the leading

areas. And by attracting people and firms,
leading areas fuel agglomeration economies,
becoming centers for innovation and growth
and driving the national economy. But the
process does not go on forever. Agglomeration economies start to be offset by congestion and pollution, the diseconomies of
agglomeration. So the spatial concentration
in leading areas starts to level off.
What, then, of the income and welfare
disparities that accompany this pattern of
first rising and then stable economic concentration? Is there a tendency for lagging
areas to catch up with leading ones as economic development progresses? What is the
role of government policies in facilitating
this convergence?

For today’s developed countries, spatial
inequalities in income and welfare rose
early, followed by slow convergence
In today’s developed countries, per capita
incomes initially diverged between subnational areas, and convergence began to set
in as GDPs per capita approached $10,000,
following an inverted-U relationship (see
figures 2.4 and 2.5 and table 2.2).44

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 85

Across areas of the United Kingdom, the
coefficient of variation of GDP per capita
increased by almost 40 percent between 1871
and 1911.45 During this period, Britain went
from a modern-day Namibia to a Jordan or
the former Yugoslavia.46 After World War II,
GDP per capita across areas of the United
Kingdom displayed a slow convergence,
continuing until the late 1970s, when spatial
inequalities stabilized.47
In the United States, the dispersion of per
capita income across states increased between
1840 and 1880, coinciding with the rise of the
manufacturing belt in the North, and the Civil
War and its aftermath. The end of the Civil
War marked the beginning of integration
between states in the North and the South,
and spatial dispersion in per capita income
began to narrow. Because the southern states
remained more dependent on agriculture, lagging areas of the United States suffered a setback in the 1920s because of a sharp drop in
the relative prices of agricultural goods. Once
this shock dissipated, the slow convergence
between lagging and leading areas resumed
with few interruptions until the 1990s, when
disparities among states stabilized.48

Canada and France also exhibit the
same inverted-U-shaped pattern of rising spatial disparities in the early stages
of development—spanning two generations—followed by slow convergence (see
figure 2.5). In France the spatial dispersion

set in. In Canada the spatial dispersion of
average gross value added between areas
increased between 1890 and 1910, carrying

over to 1929 and starting to fall by 1956.49 In
Italy, Germany, and Spain, the convergence
in per capita income gradually set in many
years after these economies reached high
income—after World War II—followed by
stable income disparities (see figure 2.6).
Government policies can facilitate this
convergence. In Japan, for example, investments in social services in lagging areas
were increased as concentration of economic production accelerated. By making

Correcting geographic disparities in postwar Japan

In 1970, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and
the Cabinet initiated the New Economic
and Social Development Plan and the
New Integrated Spatial Development Plan
(Shin-Zenso). The objective was to address
disparities in living standards, as a result
of accelerated growth in industrial areas
around Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka along
the Pacific Coast during the early postwar
years. An excerpt in the Shin-Zenso summarized the government’s vision:
Among many problems concerning spatial
disparities, disparities in living standards are
more serious than those in per capita income.
From this standpoint, the construction of the
basic services and social institutions must be
accelerated in rural towns, and new policies
must be adopted to improve the living conditions of their surrounding areas above a certain
minimum level.

instrumental in mobilizing financial
resources. The general account budget
of the central government provided
earmarked budget transfers to local governments in addition to nonearmarked
transfers. Among the earmarked budget
transfers, a substantial amount was allocated for investments in basic services
(for example, rural roads) and social institutions under cost-sharing arrangements
with the local government.
The Fiscal Investment and Loan Program pooled public funds from such
sources as postal savings and public
pension insurance premiums and then
channeled them for investments in housing and social institutions to improve

welfare in less developed areas. These
policies were effective in corralling large
investments toward achieving universal
attainment of basic living standards. Per
capita income converged between leading and other areas during the 1970s (see
the figure on the right, below). Labor
migration from rural to large urban areas
was pronounced throughout the 1950s
and 1960s, but it tapered off after the
mid-1970s.

Rising investments in social services facilitate convergence in incomes

These plans continued to provide public investment in basic services and social
institutions (for example, public utilities,
medical facilities, and school buildings)
to industrialized areas. But additional
investments were made in the less developed areas, to achieve at least a minimal
level of living standards for all places. The
result was a rapid catch-up in investment
in basic services and social institutions in
less developed areas relative to the more
industrialized areas (see the figure immediately to the right).

second source is based on the geophysically scaled economic data of terrestrial
grid-cells of 1° longitude by 1° latitude for
90 countries that span the full spectrum of
development, from Ethiopia with a GDP
per capita of less than $200, to Japan with
a GDP of more than $30,000.50
The household survey data offer an
added advantage because individual household consumption is a better measure of
welfare than income. Similar households in
different areas of a developing country can
have an average gap in household consumption of 70 percent simply as a result of location.51 In Nicaragua, a six-person household
headed by a primary-educated 40-year-old
male in the lagging area of MatagalpaJinotega consumes half of what an equivalent household consumes in the leading
area of Managua. In Canada and the United
States a household in the lowest GDP per
capita area consumes 20 percent less than
an equivalent household in the highest. In
Japan the area of residence means even less
for the gap in consumption.
As countries become more developed,
the disparities in welfare purely attributable
to location diminish.52 This pattern holds
after controlling for the land area of a country and its number of administrative areas.
Among countries partitioned into five areas,

Bangladesh and Cambodia, both with GDP
per capita less than $300,53 had spatial gaps
in consumption between their leading and
lagging areas of 89 percent and 73 percent,
respectively. For Colombia and Thailand
(with GDPs per capita of approximately
$2,000) the equivalent gaps are about 50
percent. For Canada (with a GDP per capita
of $20,000) the gap is less than 25 percent.
Among the medium-size countries, spatial
disparities in welfare follow the same pattern, falling across the spectrum from developing to industrialized countries. The same
is true for larger and smaller countries (see
table 2.3).

Fast-growing countries see spatial
disparities in income widen
East Asian growth has outstripped both the
world economy and the growth of other
developing regions. As they moved from
plan to market, Eastern European and
Central Asian countries have also grown
faster than the world (see figure 2.8). As in
the early stages of development in today’s
industrialized countries, development in
East Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe
has brought widening gaps. In Southeast
Asia the disparities in incomes per capita
between leading and lagging areas has
grown wider (see figure 2.9). In China too,
the spatial dispersion in GDP per capita
increased over the last decade (see figure
2.10). All this is consistent with the findings
of the UNU-WIDER research program.
In Eastern Europe and Central Asia,
too, disparities among subnational areas
in labor productivity and income widened. In Russia income per capita in the
lagging subnational area in 1985 was half
the national average, and that in the leading area, twice the national average. Since
then, income per capita in the lagging area
has fallen to a quarter of the national average, while that in the leading area increased
to five times the national average.54 This
divergence occurred during a reshaping
of Russia’s economic geography as state
industries in remote areas collapsed, and
economic activity started to respond to spatial variations in market potential (see box
2.5). Similarly, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic have

Spatial inefficiency and the downfall of the Soviet Union

The Earth hosts many vast and harsh
spaces, but few governments have put
as much energy into the development of
such places as Russia did under the Soviet
government.
The effort to develop Russia’s eastern
areas was substantially increased under
Stalin’s rule. A forced industrialization
attempted to shift production to the east
and create new economic bases in the
country’s geographic heart. Equalization
of economic (especially industrial) mass
across Russia was seen as the way to
make development uniform across space.
“Balanced industrial growth” remained
a slogan for a long time. In the 1930s the
new areas received more than 50 percent of the central investment, financed
mainly by expropriating wealth from
agriculture. The new areas absorbed only
capital at first. Visible effects appeared
during World War II, although the most
productive zones were close to the front,
like the Ural-Volga, where 58 percent of
factories evacuated from the west of the
USSR were placed.
An accounting of this centralized, directive effort to spread out economic mass
is depressing. Alexei Mints, the Soviet
geographer, dismissed as propaganda the
claims that directed investment boosted
backward areas and created cities “from
zero” under the five-year plans. The reality was more prosaic: the “opening up” of
eastern raw material fields coincided with
the growth of manufacturing in the west.
The shift eastward, Mints wrote, occurred
mostly in the European part.a In reality,
Russia’s demographic and economic
geocenter had moved only as far east
as the river Belaya in Bashkiria by 1990;
eight of Russia’s 11 time zones lay to the

east of the Belaya. Industrial Siberia grew
in absolute terms, but its share did not
exceed one-fifth under the Soviet price
system that favored final goods at the
expense of raw materials, transportation,
and energy (see the table below).
The Soviet social infrastructure overlapped with industrial development.
Health centers, schools, recreational,
cultural, sports, and communal-housing
facilities—called sotscultbyt—generally
belonged to enterprises. This overlap
was especially evident in large companies in remote areas, such as the
transpolar city of Noril’sk. This tradition
was combined, somewhat paradoxically, with a vigorous redistribution of
funds between sectoral and regional
departments. Profits were seized and
then given back—not necessarily to the
same place—in capital goods and assets.
The share of enterprises under the allUnion jurisdiction reached 70 percent
in the reigns of Stalin and Brezhnev. The
central government (Sovmin) controlled
less than 20 percent of industrial profits
obtained on Russian soil.
Industrial deconcentration, together
with price system distortions and an
expensive arms race, would bring the
Soviet system down. In the late 1980s
both the elite and the masses in almost
every area or republic claimed that it bore
the burdensome duty of a land that “fed
the others.” The slogan of regional khozraschet (self-repayment and economic
accounting) soon grew into political separatism and contributed to the demise of
the Soviet Union.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, the
Russian Federation became more integrated with the world market. Russia

found itself more resource abundant,
but also less populated. The market
revaluation of resources and assets
shrank the economic mass of distant
zones and poles, but deteriorating infrastructure did not reduce, and in some
cases, increased economic distance.
Industry-tied public services also collapsed in the 1990s, as firms were privatized or transferred to their sotscultbyt
to municipal authorities. For some time
under Yeltsin, the revenues of federal
and regional/local budgets were offi cially equal (50:50). In the 2000s, though,
the rules were changed in favor of the
Federation (60:40 when the external
debt payments were made, reduced
later to 55:45). But expenditures stayed
at 50:50 because of growing transfers.
Today, center-region financial relations are again based on the principle of
redistribution, though less so than in the
Soviet Union. But industry is now more
fuel and material based. After decades
of equalization plans, the economy sees
widening disparities in regional per capita
product.
The figures on the next page show this
for 1990 and 2005, using old Soviet net
material and new gross regional product
(GRP) methods and prices. The two leaders, Tyumen oblast in Western Siberia
and Moscow in the center, remained the
same. But the gap between leading and
lagging areas skyrocketed from 5 to 43.
With redistribution, the leading-lagging
gap in each area’s average personal
income in 2005 was 11. Only 20 of 88
regions exceed the Russian average in per
capita GRP, and only 22 in income. Most
poor areas reduced the gap in living standards with the help of transfers.

Welfare in remote areas has become
less dependent on economic mass in contemporary Russia. The trend is not seen
as satisfactory by some Russian observers and policy makers, but what should
be done about it is not clear. The policy
debate ranges between two polar visions:
reinforcing the redistributive system

across space based on a wider sharing of
oil and gas profits, or a forced diversification of regional economies based on military-industrial activities and research and
development initiatives. While the debate
continues, Russia’s experience under the
Soviet government offers policy lessons.
Particularly for a country with the world’s

all witnessed increased spatial disparities
across subnational areas since the beginning of transition (see figure 2.11).
The East Asian and Eastern European
countries appear to be on the rising part
of the inverted-U curve. Economic activity
is still concentrating in a small number of
favored leading areas, with agglomeration
economies increasing their productivity,
wages, and income per capita. The lagging
areas, insufficiently integrated into the
national economy, have not yet captured
spillovers from the leading areas.
The dynamics of geographic divergence
in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central
Asia have generally been a “race to the top.”
All subnational areas experienced gains
in average wages and household incomes,
though the biggest gains have gone to the

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 91

largest land area, spatial policy choices
and their efficiency could mean the difference between economic progress and
stagnation.

leading areas.55 Among the poorest provinces in China, the southwest region had
GDP per capita growth of 7.7 percent over
1979–98, the central region 7.8 percent, and
the northwest region 8.4 percent.56 East
Asian countries saw phenomenal declines in
poverty from more than 450 million poor
living on less than $1 a day in 1990 to about
120 million in 2007.57 For Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, the divergence between
1998 and 2003 was associated with a fall of
40 million in the region’s poor living on less
than $2 a day, mainly because the mass of
poverty is in leading areas.58

Some relatively closed or middleincome countries had incomes converge
In upper-middle-income Brazil, the dispersion of state per capita income around
the national mean fell from a coefficient of
variation of 0.65 in 1970 to 0.49 in 1995. 59
Chile witnessed spatial convergence in
GDP per capita across subnational areas
between 1960 and 2001, when its GDP per
capita more than doubled from $4,270 to
$10,538. 60 Upper-middle-income South
Africa also had per capita incomes converge between its towns and cities from
1990 to 2000.61 For Colombia, a relatively
closed economy, the ratio of GDP per capita in the leading departamento of Santafé
de Bogotá to the lagging departamento of
Choco fell from 10 to 6 during 1950–60
and to 3.1 in 1990.62

Figure 2.12

Many developing countries have had subnational Millennium Development Indicators
across areas converge, so even though disparities in income and material well-being
widened, basic welfare has become more
equal. In Indonesia the coefficient of variation across provinces for average years of
schooling fell from 0.43 in 1971 to 0.15 in
2000, and that for the poverty rate fell from
0.42 to 0.35.63 In Thailand infant mortality
rates narrowed from a minimum-maximum
gap of 6 percentage points between the leading and lagging areas in 1980 to 0.7 percentage points in 2000,64 around a national
mean of six deaths per 1,000 live births.
In Vietnam the gap in malnutrition rates
between leading and lagging areas fell from
20 percentage points in 1998 to 15 percentage points in 2004, accompanying an overall
improvement for all areas.65 In China territorial disparities in the human development
index declined between 1995 and 2003. The
disparity between the best-performing
province (Beijing) and the worst-performing province (Tibet) declined from 0.26 in
1995 to 0.19 in 2003 for life expectancy, and
from 0.50 to 0.32 for the human development index. The gap for literacy rates also
declined between 1990 and 2003, from 58 to
51 percentage points.66 The convergence of
basic welfare in rapidly growing East Asian
countries is epitomized by Malaysia (see figure 2.12).

For Mexican states, rates of adult literacy
and infant mortality converged from 1940
to 2002, as did life expectancy and enrollment rates from 1990 to 2002.67 In Egypt
the gap in female primary school enrollment rates between the best- and worstperforming governorates narrowed from
41 percentage points in 1995 to 25 in 2004,
as did the literacy rate and the gender gap in
literacy between 1986 and 2001.68
Not all countries have experienced spatial convergence in the Millennium Development Indicators. Countries in South Asia
and Africa still have wide internal disparities. In India and Sri Lanka the disparities across states remained large between
1981 and 1991,69,70 though there have been
absolute improvements both nationwide
and in the country’s lagging areas. In Sri
Lanka poverty was reduced in all provinces
between 1991 and 2007, with the fastest
reduction in its leading western province.71
In Kenya provincial gaps in primary
and secondary school enrollment rates
remained large between 1999 and 2004, but
more important, all areas made progress,
including the lagging Northeast.72

What’s different for today’s
developers?
In The Wealth of Nations, published in
1776, Adam Smith wrote, “It is upon the
sea coast, and along the banks of navigable
rivers, that industry of every kind naturally
begins to sub-divide and improve itself, and
it is frequently not till a long time after that
those improvements extend themselves to
the inland parts of the country.”73 What
Smith wrote in 1776 could apply equally to
the spatial processes in China’s modern economic development. What, if anything, is
different for today’s developing countries?
In some fundamental respects, very
little. Smith’s key point was that a country’s economic development, in its early
stages, tends to be led by subnational areas
that provide the greatest potential access
to markets and thus to density. But subnational areas distant from density, inland
areas in Smith’s example, tend to be left
behind. Only later in the development process do these lagging areas share more of

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 93

93

the benefits of development as a slow subnational convergence in living standards
sets in. This basic thesis holds true today.
But there are some important differences
for modern-day developing countries:

•

•

•

Given the phenomenal size of today’s
global market, development relies more
on pursuing an outward-oriented strategy in which leading areas compete and
trade globally.
The rapid transformation of internal
economic geography—and the spatial
disparities in today’s developing countries—will likely be greater than in
industrial countries during their early
stages of development.
Because redistributive mechanisms take
time to build and mature, labor mobility
and market connectivity are more potent
mechanisms to integrate lagging areas
into national economies. Globalization
and technological progress in transportation and communication potentially
provide a wider range of means to bridge
the economic distance between leading
and lagging areas.

Global markets are more important.
Because of greater integration today, global
markets are more important than domestic markets than at any time in history. The
market potential of leading areas is higher in
today’s developing countries than it was in
today’s developed countries during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, thanks
to the rapid growth of trade since the end of

World War II. Indeed, the growth of trade
has been about twice that of world income
in recent decades.74 Trade as a proportion
of world GDP is now more than 25 times
its level in 1820 (see figure 2.13). So development under protectionist policies might
have been a viable (if not optimal) strategy
in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.75 But a protectionist strategy is much
less likely to be viable today, especially in
the light of recent failures of such policies in
Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.
When a country is relatively closed, an
area’s market potential is determined mainly
by its distance to density within the country.
But once it is open, distance or access to international markets also becomes important,
and border and coastal areas tend to gain
in their shares of economic activity. Structural shifts in patterns of trade can alter the
topography of market potential in a country:
previously leading areas, perhaps favored by
policy, lose out and decline as their distance
to new leading areas increases. This is illustrated by Britain, China, and Mexico.
Openness matters for distance. Before
Mexico liberalized trade in 1985, the distance to Mexico City was the primary determinant of an area’s market potential. But
with liberalization, distance to density in

Map 2.5

the United States also became important,
and border areas such as Ciudad Juarez,
Mexicali-Calexico, Nogales, and Tijuana
had large increases in market potential and
growth, whereas Mexico City had some
depopulation and dispersion of its manufacturing activity.76
In China, during Mao’s era of selfsufficiency, heavy industries were promoted
in interior provinces, which received 71
percent of state investment between 1966
and 1970. Many companies in Shanghai
and other coastal cities were relocated to
the interior and mountainous provinces of
Guizhou, Hubei, and Sichuan.77 But since
China has become more open to foreign
trade and investment, coastal areas flourished as gateways to overseas markets, but
many interior areas floundered. Exportoriented industries (garments, electronics, leather) are concentrated in coastal
provinces, while domestic market-oriented
industries (metals, nonferrous smelting)
are dispersed (see map 2.5).78
The costs of transport and telecommunications matter more. Sea coasts and navigable rivers are natural locations for leading
areas because, in Smith’s day, shipping was
the most cost-effective way of transporting goods to domestic and international

Exporting industries concentrate in coastal areas to minimize distance to the global market

markets. But technological progress has led
to large reductions in the cost of transporting goods and in telecommunications (see
chapter 6). New (non-water-based) modes
of transport and the information technology revolution have reshaped the landscape
of economic density.
Access to knowledge is easier. So today’s
developing countries can take advantage of
world markets of unprecedented size and
can access these markets with greater ease.
At the same time, greater flows of foreign
direct investment, expanding twice as fast
as world trade, increase access to knowledge
at the world’s technological frontier.79 For
the most successful developing countries
(mainly in East Asia) of recent decades, the
result has been national growth—driven
by leading areas—far faster than that of
today’s developed countries in the early
stages of their development.
With such rapid growth in leading
areas, the geographic disparities in today’s
developing countries are far larger. Take
China, for example, whose GDP per capita
is roughly equivalent to that of Britain in
1911. London then had a GDP per capita
around 1.7 times the national average,
whereas East Anglia had a GDP per capita
two-thirds that average.80 In China today,
the comparable figures are 3.3 for the leading area of Shanghai and one-third for the
lagging area of Guizhou.81 Shanghai has a
GDP per capita ($16,044), roughly equivalent to the British average in 1988, while

WDR09_06_Ch02.indd 95

95

Guizhou has a level ($1,653) close to the
British average in 1830.82
Although comparisons between China
and Britain need to be made with caution
because of the different geographic scales of
the two countries, the basic point remains.
When today’s rich countries were developing during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the growth of their leading
areas was constrained to the rate of growth
of their domestic markets and the world
technological frontier. These constraints
limited the extent to which spatial disparities could increase in their early stages of
development. In sharp contrast, for today’s
developing countries, these constraints no
longer exist. Although the absence of these
constraints helps developing countries, the
potential disparities that can arise between
leading and lagging areas in the early stages
of development are much larger.
Although the spatial inequality between
leading and lagging areas in today’s developing countries will follow the same
inverted-U shaped path, the features of
this path will differ. The ascent is likely to
be steeper in the initial stages of development. Set against this faster rise in disparities, however, is the opportunity for faster
convergence between lagging and leading
areas as development progresses—because
modern information and communications
technologies offer a wider range of methods
to bridge the economic distance between
leading and lagging areas.

ensity and distance, the dimensions
of economic geography examined
in the two previous chapters, matter for the development of countries and
regions. Over the past two centuries, global
gross domestic product (GDP) has grown
about 2.3 percent a year, an almost 50-fold
increase in constant dollars.1 But growth has
not been uniform. Half of global GDP today
is produced on just 1.5 percent of the world’s
land, which would fit comfortably into Algeria. This dense economic mass is home to
about a sixth of the world’s people.2
High density reflects the self-reinforcing
benefits of proximity between economic
agents across spatial scales—local, regional,
and international. Distance also matters for
countries and world regions. For the past
50 years, by far the largest share of global
economic activity has been concentrated
in North America, Western Europe, and
Northeast Asia (see map 3.1). Being near
these largest markets for products and supplies opens great opportunities. Indeed, the
correlation between access to markets and
economic growth is strong.
But it is the persistence of divisions
between nation-states that sets the processes
of economic geography apart for countries
and regions. The latest wave of globalization, which began after World War II, has
been associated with a borderless world. In
1990 Kenichi Ohmae famously pronounced
that “borders have effectively disappeared.”3
For some world regions and some transactions across borders, this reflects reality. But
borders, rather than disappear, have tripled
in the past 50 years. There are now about

600 land borders between nations (see figure 3.1).4 And their number may continue
to increase if federated states split apart,
if minorities within nations achieve selfdetermination, and if some of the remaining 70 dependencies seek independence.5
This chapter shows how divisions affect
economic development, how geography
and cultural history contribute to persistent divisions, and how countries impose
barriers to productive interaction with
their neighbors and the rest of the world.
Economies benefit from gradually lowering
barriers, and rich countries tend to have the
lowest barriers to trade and factor mobility. Countries that have integrated regionally benefit from growth spillovers, larger
home markets, and scale economies in production and some types of public services.
Some countries within a region may initially prosper more than others, but living
standards eventually converge in regions
that have integrated. And in a world with
economic activity and purchasing power
concentrated in a few regions, countries that
have integrated globally benefit from access
to those markets and sources of investment.
This chapter makes the case for countries to
promote such integration.
The main findings:

•

Divisions between countries make for
thicker borders in the developing world.
Borders restrict the flow of goods, capital, people, and ideas everywhere. But
larger countries with big markets may
get by with more restrictive borders.
Small countries have to worry more.

•

•

Some types of divisions, like being landlocked, are beyond the control of individual countries. Others are self-imposed.
And as countries develop, they gradually
lower almost all types of barriers.
Economic mass is concentrated in North
America, Western Europe, and Northeast Asia. And only East Asia has significantly increased its share of global GDP
in recent decades. This global concentration matters greatly for the development prospects of today’s lagging world
regions, and increasing their access to
these large world markets must be a priority for global development policy.
Within world regions, economic development tends to be accompanied by an
initial divergence in living standards
between countries, followed by convergence. Basic health and education indicators show improvements in almost all
world regions, but there is some divergence in incomes between the richest and
poorest countries. The increasing inequality between countries within a region
reverses as lagging countries benefit from
growth spillovers from leading countries.
Overcoming divisions between countries regionally and globally is essential
for sustained progress. This points to
the importance of facilitating access to
global markets and promoting regional
integration in all its many forms (see
chapters 6 and 9).

Defining division
Borders and divisions are not synonyms.
National borders enclose people with shared
characteristics, providing a sense of place
and belonging that contributes to social welfare. They also generate manageable units
for governing society. And well defined and
settled, they provide security and stability,
yielding considerable economic benefits.
Divisions, by contrast, arise when borders
are poorly managed. They range from moderate restrictions on the flow of goods, capital, people, and ideas to more severe divisions
triggered by territorial disputes, civil wars,
and conflicts between countries. Borders are
not a problem in themselves. But the consequences for economic development are quite
different when the countries separated by

those borders are integrated in a functional
economic community (the Czech Republic
and the Slovak Republic) or divided by conflict, reducing the scope for further integration (Eritrea and Ethiopia).
Viewed through an economic lens, some
borders are much wider than others (see
map 3.2). The width or thickness of each
country’s borders is proportional to restrictions that each country imposes on the flow
of goods, capital, people, and ideas with all
other countries.6 The wider the border, the
more the country limits trade, travel, and the
flow of factors of production.

•

Economic borders are narrow in North
America, Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand; are wide in Asia,
Africa, and Eastern Europe; and are in
between in Latin America. Countries
with wide borders include emerging
economies in East Asia and countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa, which for decades
have had low growth.

Borders of the same width appear narrower around larger countries. This
reflects the reality that large countries
can often get away with more restrictive
policies. Small countries depend more
on openness to overcome small markets
and production scales.
Some countries with narrow borders are
surrounded by countries with restrictive policies, making it more difficult for
them to benefit from openness than for
countries in more open neighborhoods.
This is true more for countries that are
open but landlocked, such as Armenia,
Uganda, and Zambia, than for those
that are open and coastal, such as Chile
or Georgia. Some coastal countries, by
contrast, have such high restrictions that
they might as well be landlocked.

Comparing border widths with economic status confirms that wealthier countries typically have lower border restrictions
(see figure 3.2).7 As a country develops, it
strengthens the institutions that manage its
borders and regulate the flow of goods and
factors of production. It also becomes more
integrated into the global economy and

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 98

opens its borders to benefit from interactions
with other countries, promoting further
development. But there are exceptions. Some
upper-middle-income countries maintain
high restrictions—all of them oil exporters:
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya, and Saudi
Arabia (upper right of figure 3.2). And some
poorer countries have greatly reduced border restrictions, among them the landlocked
countries of Armenia, Uganda, and Zambia,
as well as the coastal countries of The Gambia, Georgia, Haiti, Kenya, Madagascar, and
Nicaragua (lower left).

How countries maintain divisions
Countries choose how permeable their
borders are, affecting the flows of goods,
capital, people, and ideas. And the effects of
division change as countries become more
open to some flows and restrict others.
Goods and services. Borders reduce trade.
A study in the mid-1990s found that trade
between Canadian provinces is, on average, more than 20 times greater than trade
between those provinces and equally distant
places in the United States. That implies a
“border-width” equivalent to increasing the
trade distance by 10,500 miles.8 More recent

estimates suggest that international borders
reduce trade between industrial countries by
a still significant 20–50 percent.9 The reductions are even larger for developing countries,
which tend to have higher trade barriers.
Countries that encourage exports and are
open to imports of goods and services grow
faster and reduce poverty more than countries that do not encourage exports. When
exports are concentrated in labor-intensive
manufacturing, trade increases the wages for
unskilled workers, benefiting poor people.
It also encourages macroeconomic stability,
again benefiting the poor, who are more likely
to be hurt by inflation. And through innovation and factor accumulation, it enhances
productivity and thus growth.10 There may
be some empirical uncertainty about the
strength of trade’s relationship with growth.11
But essentially all rich and emerging economies have a strong trade orientation.
A country’s openness to trade is often
measured by a country’s sum of exports
and imports as a share of GDP. But a more
direct measure is the average tariff rate,
which fell globally from close to 30 percent in the early 1980s to about 10 percent
in 2005.12 Tariffs are highest in Africa,
South Asia, and Western Asia and lowest in
member countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 99

(OECD) (see figure 3.3). Quotas, subsidies,
antidumping duties, licensing, and idiosyncratic or confusing regulations affect trade
as well.13 Using tariff and nontariff barriers,
poor countries restrict trade more than rich
countries. They also face higher barriers to
their exports. Nontariff barriers, on average, represent more than two-thirds of total
trade barriers, with higher proportions in
rich countries than in poor.
Capital. Restrictions on capital flows in
200514 are lower in industrial than in developing countries (see figure 3.4) and are greatest in Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia.
Recent empirical work—much prompted by
the financial crises of the 1990s—provides
qualified evidence that financial globalization benefits developing countries and that
greater financial openness does not by itself
contribute to more severe economic crises.15
By reducing the cost of capital in receiving
countries, freeing capital account transactions increases the availability of resources
for productive investment. It can also promote portfolio diversification, thus mitigating risk, and encourage sound monetary
management. From 1955 to 2004, freeing
capital accounts had a positive association
with growth in both developed and emerging economies.16 Liberalizing equity markets

growth.17 But short-term debt flows, which
include portfolio bond flows and commercial bank loans, can be highly volatile.
In countries where the financial sector is
underdeveloped, governments and financial
institutions may increase their exposure to
short-term debt and thus their vulnerability
to sudden outflows.
The indirect benefits of global integration
and free capital flows may be greater than
the direct effect of capital accumulation
and portfolio diversification. Open markets
can enforce monetary discipline, macroeconomic stability, and financial development. They can also strengthen institutions
and governance structures. And they can
increase integration with the global economy.18 Where markets and governance are
well developed, financial globalization contributes to GDP and productivity growth
and reduces financial vulnerability. Where
they are not, the impacts on growth are
ambiguous, and the risk of a financial crisis
is high.
People. Migration flows have increased
with globalization, but much less than trade
or capital flows. Global estimates suggest that
11 million people move annually for longerterm employment or to settle in another
country. About 3.5 million of them are lowskilled workers, many migrating to the Gulf

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 100

States or other middle-income countries.19
Migrants move for higher wages, greater
education opportunities, or a better quality
life (see chapter 5). Sending countries receive
remittances, shed surplus agricultural labor,
and benefit from return migration by those
who have acquired skills or capital abroad.
Receiving countries, many with aging populations or chronic labor shortages, increase
their labor pool by admitting unskilled
workers and their productivity by attracting
highly qualified migrants.
The economic benefits from more
migration could be great.20 The pool of
potential migrants is likely to remain
large given prevailing wage differentials
between poor and rich countries, three to
four times those triggering the mass migration of Europeans to North America in the
late-nineteenth century.21 Yet, despite the
potential benefits and the ready supply of
migrants, most countries restrict in-migration, largely because of perceived negative
effects on domestic labor markets.
Comparable information on migration
restrictions is not available. But countries
also regulate admission of short-term
visitors. Each country faces a tradeoff in
allowing people from some nations to visit
for business or pleasure, while deterring
residents of other nations for economic,
political, or security reasons. This produces a complex system of “unequal access
to foreign spaces”22 that reflects similar
restrictions for people seeking to migrate.
Residents of richer countries face fewer visa
requirements than those from poorer countries (see figure 3.5). But poorer countries
also restrict entry by visitors from other
nations. Exit can be regulated as well. Many
countries make it difficult for their citizens
to leave.23 Passport costs across countries
are as high as 125 percent of per capita gross
national income (GNI), and higher costs
are associated with lower migration rates.
Ideas. Basic labor-intensive manufacturing is a stepping stone for countries to
improve their economic fortunes. But to
maintain growth that outpaces population
and reduces poverty, an economy needs to
move from low-margin activities to the development and production of new or improved
products, a process associated with moving
from low-income to middle-income status.

10/8/08 10:35:19 AM

Endogenous growth theory stresses that new
ideas support this transition, generating economic rents that enable the accumulation of
private and public capital. China—for the past
two decades a producer of low-margin, standardized manufactured goods—now exports
more than $300 billion worth of information
and communication technology (ICT) goods
a year. So far, most of these exports have been
assembled from imported components, with
the largest rents captured by foreign firms
that develop innovative technologies and
control marketing and sales. Of the retail
proceeds from an iPod® music player assembled in China, more than half goes to Apple’s
profits and the retail and distribution costs.24
Assembly and testing account for only about
2 percent of the final sale value.
Freedom of access to all types of information is necessary for an atmosphere that
induces innovation and productivity. Ideas
and knowledge spread through the research
and development (R&D) investments by
fi rms and governments and through the
global stock of existing knowledge accessible through publications, patents, and so
on.25 Governments do not restrict the flow
of purely technical information, although
poorer countries have limited access to
such information because of cost or language barriers.
The link between the free flow of ideas
and economic development is somewhat
ambiguous and not well researched. A free
press generally reduces corruption and
increases public accountability.26 An indicator of press freedom reported annually since
2002 by Reporters without Borders covers
freedom and security in reporting, government control of media, restrictions on Internet providers, and censorship of content.27
Western industrial countries generally have
a high degree of freedom. Many low-income
countries have high restrictions on the media
and Internet traffic. Significant restrictions
persist in parts of Africa, East Asia, the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union.

Some divisions are beyond the control
of individual countries
Countries for the most part are free to
determine their openness to the outside
world. But geography and history produce
divisions over which countries have little or

no control. These include being landlocked,
being in a remote location (especially if
combined with small size), and having a
high degree of ethnic or cultural heterogeneity within and across borders.
Landlocked. There are 43 landlocked
countries in the world. Being landlocked
reduces growth by at least half a percentage
point.28 Boxes 3.1 and 3.2 illustrate further
the costs of being landlocked. Small surprise
then, that many landlocked countries are
among the world’s poorest. But being landlocked in itself is not a cause of poverty—look
at Botswana, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.
The problem is being landlocked with poor
neighbors or being landlocked far from
markets.29 Often the two go together. Africa
has the most landlocked countries (15), and
Eastern Europe and Central Asia the highest proportion—about half (see map 3.3).
Bhutan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
and Nepal in Asia, and Bolivia and Paraguay
in South America are other poor landlocked
countries.
Country size. A large land area is
often associated with abundant natural
resources (see box 3.3). A large population

A country’s neighborhood matters: regional integration and growth spillovers

Spillovers of growth from across borders
are among the main benefits of regional
integration.a In a more integrated economic
space, the long-run growth prospects of
countries become interlinked as markets
of neighboring countries become more
accessible. Growth in neighboring countries
enhances domestic growth, which benefits
neighbors. This spatial multiplier enhances
the rewards to good policy and contributes
to convergence in living standards.

Quantifying the benefits of growth
spillovers
From 1970 to 2000, membership in a
common regional trade agreement (RTA)
among neighbors was associated with a
growth spillover of 13.6 to 15.3 percent,
so every percentage point increase in
the average growth rate of RTA partners
brought a “growth bonus” of 0.14 percent
to supplement domestic growth. Associated with this is a spatial multiplier of 1.14
to 1.18, with regional integration increasing the effectiveness of growth-promoting domestic policies by 14 to 18 percent.
In Europe and East Asia, where regional
integration has been strongest, the
benefits over the past few decades have
been even larger. For these countries the

B OX 3.2

resource-poor countries of Central Africa
would be left further behind.
If Switzerland had been subject to the
same low spillovers experienced by the
Central African Republic between 1970
and 2000, its GDP per capita in 2000
would have been 9.3 percent lower, with
a cumulative GDP loss of $334 billion
(2000 constant U.S. dollars), or 162 percent of Swiss GDP (see the figure below).

Implications for landlocked and
resource-poor countries in SubSaharan Africa

22

Under current conditions, if the SubSaharan countries whose natural endowments are most favorable sustained
a growth takeoff, the landlocked and

Bolivia and Chile’s border—from wide to narrow?

Bolivia illustrates the economic
dependence of a landlocked country
on its neighbors and how economic
integration could help overcome
these divisions. After a war with Chile
in the late-nineteenth century, Bolivia
lost its access to the Pacific, and Peru,
Bolivia’s ally, also lost territory to
Chile.
Chile and Bolivia have not had
diplomatic relations since 1978, but
they are now talking. A motive for
Chile is natural gas. Since 1995 it
has relied almost exclusively on gas
from Argentina, but supplies have
been limited by high demand in
Argentina.

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 102

average growth spillover between 1970
and 2000 was 15.3 to 17.0 percent. This
contributed to a slow, but steady, convergence in living standards, with the gap in
prosperity between the poorest and richest OECD countries closing at an average
rate of 1.59 to 1.85 percent a year. Along
with this, the effectiveness of growthpromoting domestic policies has been
supplemented by 18.1 to 20 percent.
In Sub-Saharan Africa the average
growth spillover has been far weaker,
signaling the relative lack of regional integration despite a plethora of RTAs. The
growth spillover is estimated at only 2.9 to
3.9 percent, implying a spatial multiplier of
only 1.01 to 1.04. This finding of virtually no
growth spillovers holds when neighbors
are defined by contiguity rather than RTA
membership. A typical Sub-Saharan country’s growth rate was basically independent of the growth rates of its neighbors.

Bolivia has South America’s
second-largest natural gas reserves.
So economic integration could be an
incentive for resolving regional disputes. Chile would gain from energy
imports from Bolivia; Bolivia would
benefit from better access to ports,
which would make it easier to export.
Peru would likely be involved in any
agreement because it provides an
alternative, though less economic,
route to the coast for Bolivia and
because any corridor through Chile
would likely pass through former
Peruvian territory in Chile.

Conversely, small countries lack the scale,
capacity, and stock of production factors
to achieve high economic growth by themselves. But as with being landlocked, size
by itself is not a determining factor. What
determines economic prosperity is a country’s economic integration with the rest of
the world.30 Luxembourg ranks 167th in
population but has the world’s highest GDP
per capita. Fully integrated in the European
Union (EU), its highly specialized fi nancial
sector operates globally. Small countries
should thus favor economic integration,
because they will gain most from freer
trade and openness.
In world regions that are more highly
integrated, parts of a country therefore have
less incentive to remain within a nation dominated by another cultural or ethnic group.
Devolution in the United Kingdom and separatist movements in Spain confirm this. Similarly, the “re-balkanization” of Southeastern

Europe with the disintegration of the former

Sea-locked countries. Being landlocked
can generate an island effect, preventing a
country from benefiting from neighboring suppliers and markets. Small islands in
remote locations suffer similar isolation;
they are essentially “sea-locked.” They face
high transport costs for exports and imports,
higher costs for energy and intermediate
inputs, and typically higher wage costs and
rents. The problems are acute for the small
island nations of the Pacific.31 Trade preferences to support them until they become
competitive in world markets have generated large and unsustainable inefficiencies
in production. And large per capita aid
flows have had only limited impact on their
competitiveness. Closely linking up with
wealthier “patron” countries and increasing
labor mobility may be the only strategies.32

and, being closer to rich markets, benefit
more from tourism and trade.
Mauritius shows that good policy can

Africa despite being more than 900 kilometers from the nearest mainland. Its location

The benefits of size

Five benefits of being a large country:
• Smaller per capita cost of providing
many public goods, such as a judicial system or embassies.
• Larger home market, which can
increase productivity and thus
benefit economic growth.
• Stronger buffer to regional economic
shocks—if a region that specializes
in, say, agriculture suffers a recession,
the impacts can be reduced through
transfers from other regions, and
workers can seek employment elsewhere in the country.

• More effective redistributive schemes
to reduce gaps in after-tax incomes
between rich and poor regions.
• Better ability to provide security,
as the per capita cost of defense
declines.
A possible disadvantage is the
greater heterogeneity of preferences
and thus the larger coordination
costs in large democracies. Diversity
also makes it harder to overcome collective action problems.

ties in manufacturing and banking, as well as
a thriving stopover tourism industry.
Ethnic and cultural divisions. Ethnolinguistic heterogeneity imposes a coordination cost on countries, because it
often reflects differences in attitudes or
interests that need to be reconciled by
national governments. Consider the differences in opinion about joining the EU
among the French- and German-speaking
parts of Switzerland. This heterogeneity also has implications for labor mobility. For instance, the Euro zone may be a
less resilient common currency area than
the United States, because its higher cultural heterogeneity hinders adjustments to
shocks through internal migration. Ethnic
heterogeneity is often associated with civil
confl ict and with high costs for economic
growth.
Empirical evidence for the impact of cultural diversity is mixed (see also box 3.4).
Ethnic fragmentation is negatively associated with the quality of government and
with economic growth.33 The relationship
between ethnic heterogeneity and conflict

is statistically significant only in countries
where one group is in the majority but the
minority groups are still powerful—for
example, Burundi and Iraq.34 In most cases
ethnic or cultural differences are unlikely
to be the cause of conflict. But ethnic differences are exploited to achieve other
objectives, such as gaining political power
or control over resources. Ethnicity also
interacts in complex ways with other facets
of society. Autocracy, for example, reduces
growth in ethnically diverse countries more
than in ethnically homogenous ones.
Linguistic diversity varies greatly
between world regions. The Ethnologue
database includes information on almost
7,000 languages, including their location.
The heterogeneity of language groups is
very high in Africa and generally increases
with proximity to the Equator (see map 3.4
and figure 3.6). Although empirical crosscountry studies suggest that linguistic fractionalization hurts economic performance,
a regional trading language has traditionally helped overcome the divisions: Hindi
and Urdu in a large part of South Asia,

Economic costs of conflict
and territorial disputes
Impermeable borders tend to reduce economic growth. But full political unification
between countries would not necessarily improve economic performance. 35 A
full merger of two countries has a positive
country size effect but an overall slightly
negative impact on growth due to reduced
trade with the rest of the world. Only in
a few instances would both partners benefit from full political and economic integration. But integration of neighboring
markets without political integration, on
average, would increase growth across
countries significantly.
Borders further reduce economic benefits where divisions are aggravated by
conflict within or between countries. Even
when confl ict does not involve military
action, the cost can be significant. Territorial disputes impose high international economic transaction costs because of insecure
property rights and jurisdictional and policy uncertainty. Economic models suggest
that the territorial dispute between Argentina and Chile reduced trade between the
two countries by $33 billion between 1950
and 1995.36 The competing claims between
Japan and Russia over the Kurile Islands
lowered trade by $535 billion between 1952
and 1995. And those between Indonesia
and Malaysia cost $11.5 billion between
1980 and 1995. Similar disputes exist over
maritime boundaries, only about one-third
of which are settled by treaty.37
When disputes turn to military confrontation, the costs are considerably higher—
not only in loss of life, but also in economic
terms. The cost of a “typical” civil war is
about $64 billion, and an average annual
worldwide cost of about $100 billion far
exceeds global aid flows.38 A civil war in a
neighboring country is estimated to reduce
a country’s annual growth by about half a

Artificial states?

Gathered in Berlin in 1884–85, the
colonial powers determined Africa’s
borders with little concern for social
or economic divisions. Many borders
in the Middle East were similarly
drawn at the end of World War I.a
Alesina, Easterly, and Matuszeski
identify “artificial states” with a
measure of how straight a country’s
border is and whether these borders
partition ethnic groups into two or
more countries.b Northern Africa,
Northeast Asia, and South Africa have
the most artificial (straight) borders,
while South Asia and Western Africa
are the most partitioned. Eastern and
Central Africa are among the top four
regions in both categories.
Empirical analysis suggests that
artificial borders hurt economic and
social outcomes. But this link is less
significant after controlling for colo-

nial origin or location in Africa. Artificial borders are not associated with a
higher probability of war, reflecting
similar results on ethnic diversity and
conflict found by Paul Collier.c
So, avoiding economic and political
problems associated with ethnic diversity would require cultural homogeneity within countries. In Africa this would
imply a far larger number of countries.
Yet the already small size of many African countries is perhaps a more severe
problem—it prevents countries from
reaching sustainable economic scale.
As argued in this Report, the appropriate response to small size and ethnic
diversity is closer integration and more
permeable boundaries.

percentage point. It causes neighbors to
increase their military spending by 2 percent. Other costs include refugee flows
and disruption of preferred trade routes.
The civil war in the Democratic Republic
of Congo closed river access to the sea for
timber exports from the Central African
Republic.

Economic concentration
Economic output is spatially concentrated—
by any measure and across geographic
scales. Looking at grid cells, a quarter of the
world’s GDP is produced on just 0.3 percent
of the land area (about the size of Cameroon), half on 1.5 percent, and nine-tenths
on 16 percent. 39 China, Japan, and the
United States produced about half of global
GDP in 2006, and the 15 largest economies
produced about 80 percent.
Early in the Industrial Revolution, at the
beginning of the nineteenth century, GDP
per capita in today’s industrialized countries was about twice that of today’s developing and emerging countries (see table
3.1). But total GDP in China and India,
which had far larger populations, was more
than twice that in today’s G7 countries. By

the middle of the twentieth century, the G7
countries accounted for more than half of
global output (about 60 percent if the other
western industrial countries are included).
North America and Japan grew the fastest at 3.5 and 2.8 percent a year between
1820 and 1998.40 The four largest European economies grew at an annual average
of about 2 percent, not very different from
growth rates in Africa, Eastern Europe, and
the smaller Asian developing countries. But
while GDP growth exceeded population
growth by 1.7 points in the G7, it did so by
only 0.8 points in China and India and by
0.7 points in Africa. Over the 180 years to
the end of the twentieth century, these different growth rates moved the concentration of economic production more toward
the northern industrialized countries.

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 106

The concentration of economic mass in
today’s western industrialized countries and
Japan has its roots in eighteenth-century
economic and technological innovation.
Europe’s economic growth accelerated greatly
during the Industrial Revolution, with modern manufacturing starting in Great Britain
in the mid-eighteenth century and gradually
spreading across the continent. At the beginning of this process, Western Europe had less
than 20 percent of global GDP.41 By the end of
the nineteenth century, it had more than 30
percent, three-quarters of it in the four largest economies—France, Germany, Italy, and
the United Kingdom (see also figure 3.7).
This growth occurred against a backdrop
of frequent confl ict between neighboring
countries, constant changes of alliances,
and mergers and disintegrations of countries. At the beginning of the nineteenth
century, Germany included about 300 individual states. It had 1,800 customs borders,
with Prussia alone having 67 local tariff
zones.42 Only in the 1870s did Germany
fully integrate domestically. Even with a
patchwork of economic regions in Europe,
trade flows had always been large, thanks to
local or regional agreements. These expanding trade links inspired the work of David
Ricardo, who in 1817 famously described
the exchange of textiles and port wine
between Great Britain and Portugal in his
theory of comparative advantage. Ricardo’s
work motivated further trade liberalization
by governments, most of all Britain’s.
Formal economic integration did not
begin until the middle of the twentieth

century. Motivated by political as much as
economic objectives, six European countries, accounting for about a quarter of
world GDP, joined in a treaty liberalizing
trade in coal and steel. Annual GDP growth
accelerated in subsequent years to around
4.5 percent, up from only around 1 percent
in the 35 years after World War I. Although
the relative shares of European countries in
world GDP dropped somewhat, the combined EU economy maintains a share of 25
percent, largely through enlargement to its
current 27 member countries.
Europe’s economic progress was exported
to English-speaking “offshoots” in Australia,
New Zealand, and North America. Between
1820 and the late-twentieth century, their
economies grew by about 3.6 percent, almost
twice the population growth of 1.9 percent,
driven by massive migration mostly from
Europe and Asia. Their share of global GDP
increased from 2 percent to 25 percent during
that time, the lion’s share by the United States
(22 percent). Cultural proximity and close
trade ties meant that innovations crossed the
Atlantic quickly in both directions.

Japan started to industrialize fairly late.
In 1820 its GDP per capita was half that in
North America and Western Europe, a ratio
that did not change until the twentieth century. GDP growth between 1820 and 1870
was 0.4 percent a year. Industrialization
began to accelerate after the Meiji Restoration in the 1860s. The fastest growth rates
were in the second half of the twentieth century. Between 1950 and 1973, as the country opened to the world economy, Japan’s
economy grew at a rate of almost 9 percent
a year. By the late 1980s, its GDP per capita
was higher than Western Europe’s.

How did the rest of the world do?
The share of the largest industrial economies
in world GDP has fallen slightly, from 51 percent in 1950 to 46 percent in 1998.43 Among
emerging economies, Eastern Europe and
Russia reduced their share from almost 5
percent to 2.4 percent in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. The smaller shares of industrial
countries and Eastern Europe are largely due
to increases in Asia (see figure 3.8). Southeast Asia and the Pacific doubled its share

of global GDP rose from 1.4 to 2.4 percent.
The largest increase has occurred in Northeast Asia since the mid-1980s, essentially in
China, where the share of global GDP rose
from less than 1 percent to about 5.5 percent.
Shares in the remaining World Development
Report 2009 regions remained essentially
unchanged despite considerably higher population growth.44

Why does this matter? The importance
of market access
The distribution of economic production
globally matters greatly for the development
prospects of countries because of the interaction of density and distance at a global scale.
This is demonstrated by the close empirical relationship between trade as a driver
of growth and two variables that define the
well-known gravity model of trade: (1) the
distance between trading partners, and (2)
their economic size as measured by GDP

B OX 3.5

Market access and per capita incomes

Quantifying market access (sometimes
called “market potential”) is not just of
theoretical interest. Empirical studies have
shown that market and supplier access
have a significant impact on growth and
income. For instance, halving a country’s
distance from its trading partners is associated with a 25 percent increase in per capita
income—more than the combined effect of
a coastal location and open trade policies.a
Trade benefits a country by raising factor
incomes (wages) through expenditures by
trading partners for goods produced in that
country. The level of expenditures is in large
part determined by the size of the trading
partner’s economy (density) and by physical
market access, largely determined by proximity to trading partners (distance) and the
effect of borders (division).b
Between 1970 and 2003, the distribution
of per capita income spread out, reflecting
greater global inequality among countries—the poorest countries now have
smaller incomes relative to the United
States (see the figures at the right). The distribution also moves to the right, implying
that market potential is increasing almost
everywhere as a result of global GDP
growth. And its slope is getting steeper, so

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 108

(see box 3.5). Trade decreases with distance
and increases with GDP, so any country will
trade more with nearby countries and with
countries that have a larger GDP. Despite
reductions in transport and communication
costs, the trade-reducing impact of distance
increased until about a half century ago,
remaining “puzzlingly” high since then (see,
for example, for Brazil in figure 3.9).45
This empirical evidence may be at odds
with the rapidly increasing long-distance
trade between, say, China and the United
States or between Japan and Europe. But
this increase in trade may not be so much
due to trade cost reductions. It is largely
driven by the other factor in the gravity trade relationship: economic output.46
China’s GDP has increased, providing the
economic mass to export goods to international markets and to import consumer
goods, capital equipment, and intermediate
inputs. Increasing trade, in a self-reinforcing process, generates scale economies in

the returns to market potential are increasing—the same amount of market potential buys more per capita income—at least
for some countries.
There continues to be a large variance of
GDP per capita at any given market potential. Haiti’s market potential is higher than
New Zealand’s. Its proximity to the United
States raises its market potential, reflecting
the interaction between economic size

and distance from markets. For any given
level, the size of the economy determines
how well a country can take advantage of
market access. Rich countries like Australia
and New Zealand can compensate for a
remote location by offering a fairly large
market and supply capacity.

the trade infrastructure and services, such
as efficient ports and frequent container
shipping links (see chapter 6). Larger economies and richer countries can thus overcome the friction of long trade distances
with higher economic density.

Divergence, then convergence
The changing geographic distribution of
world economic output reflects the concentration of economic mass initially in Western Europe and later in North America.
More recently, some deconcentration has
occurred as first Japan and then other economies in the East Asia region have grown.
China and India are reclaiming their position among the countries and regions with
the highest shares of global GDP. Country
access to input and output markets influence
the geographic distribution of absolute levels

of economic output. As these distributions
change, so too do the prospects of national
economies. These, in turn, influence development outcomes at the regional and country levels, reflected in levels and changes in
income, health, and human capital. This
human capital, most often considered an
input contributing to human development,
is also a development outcome that raises the
quality of life for individuals.
Three broad trends:

•

A general increase in income and basic
living standards globally, but with some
big exceptions.
Considerable divergence of incomes
between the richest and the poorest

is better off than any previous generation
in human history. GDP per capita in 1990
international dollars increased tenfold from
$565 to $5,700 over the last 500 years, while
population grew from 400 million to more
than 6 billion (table 3.2). Since 1820 output
growth has been about 2.2 percent a year,
bringing with it a considerable rise in living
standards. Life expectancy at birth rose from

26.5 years in 1820 to 32.8 years in 1910 to
about 68 years in 2005.47 In the last 35 years
alone, average global life expectancy grew
by about 10 years. And a much larger share
of the world’s population now has access to
basic education. In 1870 the mean years of
schooling was 1.1 years, and the adult literacy rate 25.5 percent.48 By 1929, schooling
had increased to 2.5 years, and by 2000, to
6.7 years, and literacy to 43.8 percent and
then to 78.3 percent (see figure 3.10).

Over the past 500 years, per capita output
increased 40-fold in Japan and 65-fold in
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the
United States (see table 3.2).49 In Africa
it increased only threefold, and in Asia
(not including Japan), fivefold. Spreads
between the poorest and the richest regions
increased from a factor of 2 in 1500 and 5 in
1870 to almost 20 by the end of the twentieth century. During the past two centuries,
the Gini coefficient of inequality increased
by 30 percent. Per capita income inequality
among world citizens increased by 60 percent, as measured by the Theil index, largely
because of income divergence between
countries rather than within countries.50
The main story is one of an enormous
increase in per capita incomes in Europe
and its offshoots. More recently this has
happened in East Asia, with Japan, whose
GDP per capita has increased tenfold since
1950, and was followed by the Republic of
Korea; Taiwan, China; China; and countries
in South Asia. GDP per capita in China,
though still low in absolute terms, grew at
8.4 percent a year between 1990 and 2005. At
the low end of the income distribution, total
GDP in the Central Africa region increased
threefold between 1960 and 2006, compared
with Northeast Asia’s 30-fold increase (see
figure 3.11). With population growth outpacing economic growth, per capita incomes
in Central Africa fell by 8 percent in constant
prices. Incomes in the poorest countries in
the world—mostly landlocked and many in
Africa, home to the “bottom billion” of the
world’s population—declined by 5 percent
during the 1990s.51

Between 1960 and the late 1980s, almost
every country in the world showed continual increases in life expectancy at birth.52 In
South Asia it increased from 42 years to 60,
and in Northern Africa from 47 years to 65.
The exception was in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Until the late 1980s, life expectancy increased
slowly in Western, Central, and Eastern
Africa and slightly faster in Southern Africa,
where it rose from 46 years to about 60. Since
then, however, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has
caused a large increase in mortality, bringing
life expectancy in Southern Africa below its
level in 1960. In Central and Eastern Africa,
life expectancy is down less dramatically,
and Western Africa contained the epidemic
and saw only a slight decline in the rate of
improvement. Nine of the 10 countries
showing the worst trends are in Sub-Saharan
Africa, and most of these are in Southern or
Southeastern Africa (see figure 3.12).
Similar to life expectancy, global inequality in access to education fell sharply from
a Gini coefficient for years of schooling of
0.79 in 1870 to 0.39 in 2000.53 The high Gini
coefficient in the nineteenth century was
largely due to near-universal primary education in Western Europe and its offshoots.
Other world regions started expanding education much later, and inequality dropped

groups (see figure 3.13).55 The ratio of highest
to lowest population-weighted average education dropped from 9.7 years to 3.1.56 These
improvements have been fairly uniform
across regions, so the difference between the
highest and lowest region has remained essentially constant. Because poorer countries start
from a far lower level, however, their percentage improvements are much higher, suggesting eventual convergence.

economies should converge over time. Will
poor countries eventually catch up with the
rich? The question received considerable
attention among growth economists in the
late 1980s and 1990s.57 They produced tools
and techniques to analyze convergence,
relating growth to initial income, with the
expectation that lower initial status is associated with higher growth rates. But there
has been little, if any, convergence between
countries globally over the past five decades
(see figure 3.14). There is even some indication of divergence, though the trend is weak.
Within world regions, the evidence is much
more differentiated.
Regional integration and temporal dynamics make the study of convergence important.
First, economic fortunes are shaped by what
neighboring countries do, and successful economic integration—overcoming divisions—
can pull weaker countries toward incomes
that they cannot achieve in isolation. Higher
convergence would be expected in regions
that have integrated. Second, in fast-growing
regions, there initially is divergence as the
leading regional economies pull away, but
later there is convergence as poor countries
benefit from growth spillovers and begin to
catch up over time.
In East Asia, the fastest-growing world
region in recent years, convergence followed initial divergence. From 1950 to 1970,
incomes diverged sharply as first Japan; and
later Hong Kong, China; and then Singapore
grew at very high rates (see figures 3.15 and
3.16a). In the 1970s other countries joined
the fast-growth club, notably the Republic of

Some income convergence within
faster-growing regions
Neighboring countries can provide mutually
beneficial economic linkages, spillovers, and
complementarities that allow whole groups
of countries to increase their incomes. If this
increases growth rates in poorer countries,

levels last seen in 1960. This convergence has
much to do with market policies in China
and Vietnam as well as with a special blend
of regional economic integration against a
backdrop of globalization.
There are few signs of convergence where
growth has been sluggish and regional integration limited, as in Western Asia and Eastern Europe (see figure 3.17). Western Asia
includes resource-rich countries, with low
and high populations, as well as resourcepoor countries, such as Jordan. Low levels
of intraregional trade indicate low levels of
integration. Eastern Europe shows low variation in per capita income until about 1990.58
After the disintegration of the Soviet Union
and the fall of the Berlin Wall, per capita
incomes dropped drastically in some countries and moderately in others. This divergence was reinforced as the western-most
countries reoriented their economic linkages
toward Western Europe, eventually joining
the EU. Belarus and initially Ukraine, by
contrast, maintained close links to the Russian Federation, which only recently began
benefiting from natural resource–driven
economic growth.
The southernmost economies in the
Latin America and Caribbean region experienced relatively low growth and limited
convergence (see box 3.6). At the northern
end of the region, in 1994, Mexico entered
the first major regional free trade pact that
includes both industrial and developing
countries. The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) eliminated tariffs on
most products traded between the United
States, Canada, and Mexico. The evidence
since then illustrates three points about formal regional integration processes: 59

Korea and Taiwan, China. Between 1976 and
1992, what looked like moderate divergence
(see figure 3.16b) actually represented two
groups of countries on separate but closely
linked convergence paths (see figure 3.16c).
Overall, this led to a strong regional convergence as the variation among country GDPs
per capita—while still large—dropped to

•

Formal integration followed many years
of preparation, gradual informal integration, and domestic policy changes.
Mexico unilaterally reduced trade barriers and implemented regulatory changes
long before the agreement took effect.
The agreement led to large increases in
trade and foreign direct investment (FDI)
flows. Economic analysis suggests that
without NAFTA, Mexico’s global exports
would have been about 50 percent lower
and its FDI 40 percent lower. This likely
contributed to significant poverty reduc-

tion and income growth. GDP per capita
in 2002 may have been as much as 4 percent lower without NAFTA.
Despite these positive impacts on the
Mexican economy, the agreement has not
produced rapid convergence in incomes
(see figure 3.18). Mexico has avoided
major economic crises, suggesting greater
stability that can have significant welfare
effects.60 But its performance relative to
the U.S. economy has not differed much
from that of several other Latin American economies.

The large differences in economic output
will likely remain significant for some time.
In fact, steady-state convergence estimates
suggest that Mexican incomes will reach
only about half of U.S. incomes. Among
the main reasons are significant differences
in the quality of domestic institutions, in
the innovation dynamics of firms, and in
the skills of the labor force. These will all

Neighborhoods matter: Southern Cone versus Southern Europe

Half a century ago the countries in the
southern cone of South America—
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay—
had per capita incomes similar to or
higher than the three Southern European
countries with which they had strong cultural bonds—Italy, Portugal, and Spain.
The two groups have since followed different growth trajectories. For most of
this period, the Southern Cone countries,
except Chile, followed similar protectionist policies. Between 1950 and 2006 the

four countries’ GDP per capita grew by an
average 1.7 percent a year.
Economic dynamics in Southern
Europe unfolded differently. Italy was one
of the founding members of the European Community, and Portugal and Spain
joined in 1986 after emerging from a long
period under authoritarian regimes. From
lower levels, they grew at more than 3
percent a year, far outpacing Latin America. While incomes converged in both
regions, they did so faster in Western

Europe at around 1 percent a year than in
South America at 0.3 percent. Italy, Portugal, and Spain benefited from regional
growth spillovers, proximity to large markets, and cohesion policies within a single
integrated Western European market. In
the Southern Cone, regional integration
was slow, and integration with wealthy
markets in the Western Hemisphere was
neglected for long periods.

Geography, globalization,
and development
Four main aspects explain the persistent regional concentration of economic
wealth over the past few centuries, with

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 115

new countries or regions only occasionally
breaking into the ranks of the rich. First,
physical geography has helped some countries become rich initially but continues
to hold back others. Second, the forces of
economic geography—starting from an
initial advantage, such as technical innovation during the Industrial Revolution—
facilitated agglomeration economies and

10/8/08 10:35:25 AM

116

WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 0 9

reinforced the concentration of economic
activity. Third, regional spillovers increased
economic activity in other countries within
a region, further increasing the scale and
scope of economic production. Fourth,
entirely new regions of economic concentration emerged—as a response to congestion and a shift in established regions from
manufacturing to services, “freeing up”
manufacturing opportunities elsewhere.
What does this imply for the prospects in
today’s lagging world regions?

How much does geography matter
today?
First-nature geography. Physical endowments influence the development prospects
of countries. For instance, agricultural
intensification in areas of good agroecological endowments generates surpluses that
can be shifted to more productive uses. But
these assets are not distributed uniformly.
As Landes (1998) puts it: “Nature like life
is unfair, unequal in its favors.” Researchers have found a strong correlation
between economic output and geographic
characteristics. A simple regression of output density (GDP per square kilometer)
on geographic variables—mean annual
temperature, mean annual precipitation,
mean elevation, terrain “roughness,” soil
categories, and distance from coastline—
captures 91 percent of the variability in
the density of economic production.61 A
similar analysis explains 20 percent of the
difference in per capita output between
tropical Africa and industrial regions, and
12 percent of the difference between tropical Africa and other tropical regions. Climate also interacts with other factors, such
as disease. Vector-borne diseases strike
disproportionately in tropical countries,
reducing productivity. Malaria is estimated to cause approximately 1 million
deaths and more than 200 million clinical
events among Africans each year.62 Other
purely geographic factors—such as being
landlocked, which shaves half a percentage
point off annual GDP growth, or a remote
location—were discussed earlier.
Does this mean that geography dictates the destiny of countries? No. Physical geography helps explain initial growth

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 116

differences and some of the variation in
economic outcomes. But most of these
constraints can be overcome with enough
resources. They are thus a proximate rather
than an ultimate cause of underdevelopment. High levels of malaria, for instance,
may be as much a symptom of persistent
poverty as a cause (see box 3.7). They are
a grave concern for development interventions but insufficient to explain global
patterns of economic wealth or to predict
future growth potential by themselves.
Second-nature geography. An alternative but complementary explanation for
global development patterns shows how
small initial differences between countries
and regions (for instance, natural endowments) can, over time, generate large disparities. A central question in economic
development is how much growth is due
to differences in human and physical
capital accumulation, and how much to
the efficiency of using these factors.63 Evidence from a growing number of studies
confi rms that levels of capital accumulation alone are insufficient to explain crosscountry differences in growth and income.
Instead, total factor productivity (TFP)—
how efficiently factors of production are
combined—tends to better explain differences in growth and income between
countries.64
TFP is, however, a vague concept that
subsumes several aspects of economic production. Most generally, it relates to better
technology for combining inputs to generate products or services. This leads to cost
reductions and thus increased competitiveness. Complementarities, spillovers, and
economies of scale also explain differences
in TFP. Geographically, these externalities
imply benefits for producers to locate close
to each other. Combined with scale economies that favor larger production units,
the concentration of economic activities
increases across geographic scales. European economic growth during the modern
era was initiated by the industrial revolution, which generated major technological
advances. Improved technology and population growth reinforced scale economies
leading to concentrated centers of industrialization. These centers attracted workers

The influence of first-nature geography: is it possible to eradicate malaria?

The species of Plasmodia that cause
human malaria most likely reached their
maximum global extent in 1900. Since
that time the affected area has been progressively reduced by a regionally variable
mixture of improving human conditions
and deliberate control. The map below
shows the difference between the widest
hypothesized extent of the distribution
of all types of human malaria around
1900a and the contemporary limits of Plasmodium falciparum,b the most clinically
severe and epidemiologically important
form of human malaria, in 2007. The formerly malarious areas are concentrated in
the temperature latitude extremes of the
parasite’s ancestral distribution, in both
the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
Researchers have documented the
strong inverse correlation between the
economic prosperity of nations and their
contemporary malaria burden.c Richer
countries have less malaria, poorer countries more. This work also documents the
many mechanisms, from individual to
macroeconomic, for malaria to contribute to poverty. What if the constraint of
malaria were lifted? Is it possible to eradi-

cate malaria? The question has never been
satisfactorily answered at the global scale.d
But it is possible to start addressing
the problem. In the map below, risk is
classified as stable if more than 0.1 case is
recorded per 1,000 population each year,
unstable if below this figure, and zero if
no cases have been recorded within the
three most recent years of records. When
overlaid on a population map for 2007,e
2.37 billion people were found to live in
areas with any risk of P. falciparum transmission. Globally, almost 1 billion people
lived under unstable, or extremely low,
malaria risk. Conditions of low risk are
typical in the Americas and in South and
East Asia but are also common in Africa.
For 1 billion people at risk of unstable
malaria transmission, malaria elimination
is epidemiologically feasible. Epidemiological feasibility was determined by
reference to historical experience during
the global malaria eradication program
and by inferring, through modeling, that
transmission could be interrupted by taking insecticide-treated bednets to scale.f
There are many reasons in many regions
why elimination may not be a simple mat-

ter of epidemiological feasibility. Political
instability and geographic accessibility
are obvious examples, but these are operational and not technical obstacles.
What can be achieved with the 1.37
billion people suffering stable risk? Initial evidence suggests that a substantial
fraction of those affected will be living in
areas of very low prevalence.g A detailed
investigation with mathematical models
could estimate the impact from the existing toolkit of interventions. When this estimate combined with a detailed analysis
of the data on the efficiency of historical
interventions, considerable insight could
follow. These approaches will help determine whether malaria is eradicable and, if
so, under what time frame and with what
resources.

and new firms, instigating a virtuous, selfreinforcing process that led to even greater
concentration.
Development is contagious, tending to
spread across regions. Although growth
centers may start within specific areas in a
country—the industrial belt in the northwest of England or the mill towns in New
England—dynamic centers tend to spread
out. At the international level, growth
spreads to neighboring states, giving rise to
regional growth centers. With enough openness and interaction between countries, the
mechanisms for spreading growth are technological spillovers and increasing specialization, breaking up production processes.
This makes it more likely that some of the
demand for intermediate products will be
satisfied from neighboring countries. This
can greatly expand trade, which produces
scale economies and steep increases in economic productivity. The larger labor and
capital pools and the greater market size
that emerge due to gradual improvement of
transport links can lead to the rapid takeoff
of a regional economy.65
New regions of growth and wealth can
emerge. This happens when growth in a core
region has reached a point at which congestion
and rising wages encourage entrepreneurs to
seek new locations for production in nearby
regions. This happened in Western Europe,
when firms relocated manufacturing capacity to Central and Eastern European countries, and in North America, when Mexico
attracted investment in manufacturing capacity for the U.S. and Canadian markets. This
contagion model of region building would
suggest that all economic activity remains
within an expanding contiguous zone—but
it does not.
Under some conditions, economic
growth may leap to an entirely new region.66
The location of this new center of global
manufacturing depends on many factors,
including market size, trade and transaction
costs, initial human and physical capital
endowments, and competition from other
potential growth regions. This leapfrogging
model matches the emergence of East Asia
as a global hub initially for labor-intensive
production and later for technologically
more advanced production. Half a century

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 118

ago, Japan would have seemed an unlikely
source of inexpensive electronics and consumer goods for the U.S. market given the
distance between the two countries. But
the emergence of containerized shipping
allowed Japanese producers to be competitive in North American markets and later
in the European markets.67 The Republic
of Korea and Taiwan, China, followed in
Japan’s footsteps. Manufacturing investments spread from there to South Asia, particularly Malaysia and Thailand, and then,
after economic liberalization, to China.

What do we learn from this?
Size matters a lot. To generate scale
economies, a certain population and an economic mass need to be in place. In Europe
during the Industrial Revolution, a relatively
large and concentrated population provided
both the labor that produced manufactures and the market that consumed them.
North America, when it shifted from natural resources to industry, had a large population along its eastern seaboard, which grew
quickly with immigration from Europe and
elsewhere. East Asia has a vast population,
with first Japan and later China serving as
engines of manufacturing growth in the
region. Each region benefited from a large
home market, but much of the production
was soon destined for export both within the
region and to the rest of the world.
Few countries have lifted their economic fortunes based only on exports
of primary commodities. Botswana, a
sparsely populated country with large mineral wealth and good policies, is one exception. Well-managed mineral resources can
help generate capital that can be invested in
other sectors, but few countries have done
this successfully. Agriculture—important
for subsistence, for rural income generation, and for specific regions in a country—cannot by itself lift poor countries
to middle- or high-income status. Rural
activities are either too small in scale to
provide sufficient surplus for export—or,
in cases in which agricultural production
has sufficient scale, it often benefits only
a few large landowners or agribusinesses.
The verdict on services is still out. But it is
unlikely that poor countries have enough

skilled white-collar workers to generate
broad-based growth spillovers. India has
a large export-oriented service sector, but
it employs only about 560,000 of its more
than 1 billion inhabitants, most in jobs
in constant-return customer support and
back-office tasks.68
Manufacturing remains important.
Each successful world region has, at some
point, made significant and broad-based
gains with basic labor-intensive manufacturing. This process initially led to a diversification of production as countries grew richer
and consumers demanded more varieties.
As economies in these regions expanded,
production and employment in individual
countries started to specialize in what they
were best at, giving rise to interlinked networks of production trading intermediate
goods among countries within the region.
This is the point at which China and some
of the other “second-wave” economies in
East Asia have arrived. In Europe and other
regions that industrialized earlier, the share
of manufacturing in the economy has fallen
quite rapidly, with only highly specialized
manufacturing remaining, such as machine
tools or information technology (IT) equipment. In these countries, the service sector,
including the research and design of products that will be manufactured elsewhere,
now accounts for the largest share, by far, of
employment and economic output.
Openness helps a lot—but it has to be
introduced with care. Each of today’s successful regions initially developed its manufacturing sector behind a fairly substantive
wall of tariffs and other protections. Only as
their economies matured and became more
dependent on foreign inputs and markets
for their products did they gradually open
their borders and integrate regionally and
globally. The rise of interlinked production
networks that cross international borders
within each region required more coordination and cooperation among countries,
not just for trade in goods and services, but
also to settle on common standards and
regulations.
The process proceeded somewhat differently in each region, most formally within
Europe, where the EU’s political and economic integration superseded a patchwork

Integration takes a long time, and its benefits do
not come overnight

In Europe, after the diffusion of modern industrial technology and the
expansion of trade links in the early
nineteenth century, it took more than
100 years before formal integration
processes began in the 1950s. Even
then, the efforts were limited to agreements on narrowly focused economic
issues between six countries. Gradually
they expanded into additional areas
of cooperation such as customs and
nuclear energy. It took 16 years before
these agreements were consolidated
in the European Community in 1967.
Membership expanded slowly, with
three countries joining each decade
between 1970 and 2000, and finally
the addition of 12 Eastern and Central
European countries by 2007. Just as
the initial Coal and Steel Community
formalized long-established economic
and cultural ties between the member
countries, each subsequent expansion
followed a long period of ever-closer
interaction between members and
accession countries.

Formal, de jure, integration thus followed de facto integration, providing
a framework and structure for deepening already close relations. This
gradual process allowed institutions
to develop and gave labor, financial,
and product markets time to prepare
for possibly harsh adjustments, particularly for recently joining countries
with much smaller economies. Bulgaria and Romania, which joined in
2007, added 8.6 percent to the EU’s
land area and 6.3 percent to its population but only 1 percent to its GDP.a
So the convergence of social and
economic outcomes across member
countries will also take longer. Assessing the benefits from integration
thus requires a long time horizon, as
increased labor mobility, investment
in private and public capital, and
other structural changes accelerate
growth in lagging member countries.

of bilateral agreements among a fairly large
number of countries (see box 3.8). East
Asia, by contrast, has created tightly linked
entrepreneurial production networks with
relatively little formal protocol. Initial integration in North America was facilitated by
a shared language and cultural background
between Canada and the United States. The
relatively recent addition of Mexico has
removed some divisions between economies
of greatly different per capita incomes.
Openness and integration are most beneficial for smaller or landlocked countries
whose access to world markets depends on
neighboring countries. Luxembourg’s small
size does not matter, because it is tightly
integrated in the European economy and
thus operates more like a specialized city in
a large country. Switzerland’s being landlocked has not constrained the development
of highly specialized manufacturing and service sectors. It can connect to world markets
by air or through neighboring countries, and
its neighbors are significant destinations for

its outputs. Integration has enabled the two
countries to benefit from specialization and
scale economies that would otherwise be
achievable only in far larger countries.
To facilitate integration, industrial
regions invested heavily in physical infrastructure that promotes intraregional trade.
Initially, sea and river transport was most
important for exporting manufactured
products, requiring good coastal and river
ports. More recently, interrelated production processes require more timely availability of intermediate products, which has
moved a larger proportion of trade to road,
rail, and air links.

What’s different for today’s
developers?
Are the conditions today different, or is this
just a continuing or recurring phase of globalization similar to that of a hundred years
ago? In fact, goods and factor markets may
be no more closely linked today than they
were a century ago. They may be somewhat more integrated for trade, no more
integrated for capital, and less integrated
for labor.69 So how can lagging regions and
countries join the group of leading world
regions? Do they need to wait their turn,
or are there ways for them to break out of a
geographic determinism?
Some clear differences in the current phase
of globalization and economic development
relate to the dynamics of economic geography and the persisting divisions between
countries. First, the scale and speed of economic integration in recent decades have
been unprecedented. The economic liberalization in China and India, as well as in Russia and South America, adds huge numbers
of unskilled workers to global production
capacity.70 In many ways this is a reemergence of those regions (Asia accounted for
almost 60 percent of world GDP as recently
as the early nineteenth century).
China and India, because of the enormous size of their home markets, are essentially world regions of their own. With no
formal internal divisions, they benefit from
scale economies and provide the incentive for investors and trading partners to

WDR09_07_Ch03.indd 120

overcome their significant external barriers—the thick borders in the map that
opened this chapter (see map 3.2). Smaller
countries do not have this luxury. They
must learn to manage their borders more
rapidly to achieve economic integration
with their neighbors to attain competitive
production scale and to access world markets. Countries and regions that do this
faster will have an advantage, but it will not
be easy. By providing a vast unskilled labor
pool—and relatively little human or physical capital—countries like China and India
can absorb new manufacturing capacity for
a long time. These are precisely the types
of activities that might provide a path to
middle income for the poorest countries.
China also demonstrates the benefits of its
economic rise for its neighbors. Almost all
East Asian countries have sometimes significant trade surpluses with China in most
manufacturing sectors.71
Second, there has been an unprecedented fragmentation of production processes. This includes not only the intrafi rm
division of manufacturing steps across
several places, but more important the
intraindustry trade of increasingly specialized components and services, sometimes
over long distances. Advances in communications technology facilitate these complex
buyer-supplier networks. Although integrated in global markets, production tends
to be regionally concentrated. For smaller
countries, this may be both a threat and
an opportunity. The threat is that smaller
countries with poor infrastructure and low
skills will remain outside global trading
networks. The opportunity is that, while
spatial concentration remains beneficial
for production, increasing specialization
allows concentration and scale economies
within subsectors in which even small players can carve out a niche.
In 1999 India’s then-prime minister, Atal
Behari Vajpayee, remarked on some of the
same issues that have been discussed in this
chapter: “We can change history but not
geography. We can change our friends but
not our neighbors.”72 Is he correct? On one
level, certainly. Countries cannot just pack
up and move to a better neighborhood the

way individuals can. But in an economic
and political sense, countries can change
their neighborhoods. Japan and the United
States overcame deep divisions of history
and geography to become close neighbors
by developing extensive transport links
and increasing economic interdependence.
Mexico and Turkey may be changing neighborhoods by reorienting economic ties from
their traditional cultural backyards to more
prosperous countries in another part of
their neighborhood. European integration
ended centuries of division and war. Since
December 2007, travel from the Portuguese
Algarve to Estonia is possible without once
showing identification.

Many world regions continue to face
the impacts of significant division. But this
Report shows that countries can improve
their economic fortunes by changing their
neighborhoods virtually and practically.
For this, they must do two things. First,
they must overcome the limitations and
barriers of geography by developing close
trade and transport links with markets and
sources of investment in rich and emerging
regions of the world (see chapter 6). And
second, they need to seek strength in numbers by “thinning” their borders and integrating their economies with their physical
neighborhood (see chapter 9).

Overcoming Division in Western Europe

The day will come when you France, you Russia, you Germany, all you nations of the continent, without losing your distinct qualities and your glorious individuality, you will merge into a superior unit, and you will constitute European fraternity.
—Victor Hugo, from a speech at the 1849 International Peace Congress

ictor Hugo was laughed at when
he said this, as were several of
his predecessors who proposed
European integration. It took the catastrophe of two world wars to get people
to take the idea seriously and make
policy makers ready for radical change.
The scale of devastation and misery is
the key to understanding the drive for
integration: on top of the horrifying
death toll, the war caused enormous
economic damage. The war cost Germany and Italy four or more decades
of growth and put Austrian and French
gross domestic products (GDPs) back
to levels of the nineteenth century.1
Overcoming division and its dramatic consequences was the objective
of European leaders after World War

V

II. Destructive nationalism—and its
economic dimension, protectionism—were indeed partly blamed for
the disaster. Economic integration was
thus viewed as the best way to avoid
another war. That it should come
through peaceful means and with
the main objective of maintaining
peace was—and remains—a unique
endeavor. In this respect, European
integration is a clear success. But it
was not clear in the 1940s and 1950s
that this vision of “Peace through Integration” would succeed, particularly
because it came at the same time as the
Cold War’s division between the East
and the West.
Under American pressure, 13
European countries created the

Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) in 1948
to implement the Marshall Plan. Its
mandate was to reduce trade barriers,
particularly quota restrictions. Europe
in the early postwar years was a tariffand quota-ridden economy. Removing trade barriers fostered the rapid
growth of trade. Between 1950 and
1958, manufacturing exports grew by
almost 20 percent a year in West Germany, 9.2 percent in Italy, and 3.8 percent in France. Additionally, average
annual GDP growth was 7.8 percent in
West Germany, 5 percent in Italy, and
4.4 percent in France. Correlation is
not causality, and reconstruction was
a strong engine of growth. But the
rapid growth as European trade was

liberalized was changing the minds
of European policy makers. European
integration was not just a political
project—it also made economic sense.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was launched by
France and Germany, who invited other
nations to place these two sectors under
its supranational authority. The project was both political and economic
because it applied a supranationality
onto two sectors that were considered
strategic for economic and military

reasons. Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg,
and the Netherlands joined the project
in 1951, and these six would become
the driving force behind European
integration (see map G2.1). The ECSC
showed that economic cooperation was
more feasible than political or military
integration.
The Treaty of Rome in 1957 created
the six nations of the European Economic Community (EEC). The move
committed the six to unprecedented
economic integration. Not only would

a custom union remove all tariffs for
intra-EEC trade and establish a common external tariff, but also a unified
economic area would promote free
labor mobility, integrated capital markets, free trade in services, and several
common policies. This degree of economic integration was not feasible
without deep political integration. So,
in retrospect, “using economics as a
Trojan horse for political integration
worked like a charm.”2 As “guardians of
the Treaty,” the Court and the European
Commission would control those countries (especially France when de Gaulle
returned to power) that came to reject
the level of supranationality implied by
the Treaty. From 1966 to 1986, however,
the deep integration promised by the
Rome Treaty stalled (see figure G2.1).
Europeans began to erect barriers that
took the form of technical regulations
and standards, fragmenting markets—a
classic reaction by lobbying industries
to defend their rents.
The Single European Act (1986)
relaunched the process of deepening economic integration—all the more stunning given the slow disintegration during
the 1970s. Emphasizing the mobility
of capital, the Single Act was also partly
responsible for the birth of the European Monetary Union (EMU). Indeed,
the fixed exchange rate of the European
Monetary System implied, with free
capital mobility, the loss of monetary
sovereignty. This made the EMU more
politically palatable for countries committed to fixed exchange rates.
Overcoming division means reducing the impact of borders on trade
flows. Has this been so in the European
Union (EU)? One way to answer the
question is to compare the volume of
trade within borders with the volume
of bilateral trade between countries. The
ratio of the two is the “border effect.”
Fontagné, Mayer, and Zignago (2005)
do this for the EU-9, the six founders
plus Denmark, Ireland, and the United
Kingdom. The border effect for reported
intra-EU trade fell from around 24 in
the late 1970s to 13 in the late 1990s—a

substantial increase in integration (see
figure G2.2) unmatched in the world.
The border effect between the EU-9 and
the United States, while decreasing fast
during the period, remains more than
twice that within the EU. Borders in the
EU have become thinner, but they have
not disappeared.

WDR09_08_GIM02.indd 124

The European regional integration
process has spread. As the EU deepened
and enlarged, the cost of discriminatory treatment (the natural implication
of any regional integration process) for
outsiders increased, creating a “domino
dynamic of regionalism.”3 Even European countries that most valued their

sovereignty applied for membership.
That the EU with its unmatched supranationality remains so attractive for
outsiders is evidence of an enduring
success.
