Data Notes
The countries included in regional and income groupings in
this Report are listed in the Classiﬁcation of Economies table
at the end of the Selected World Development Indicators.
Income classiﬁcations are based on GNP per capita; thresholds for income classiﬁcations in this edition may be found
in the Introduction to Selected World Development Indicators. Group averages reported in the ﬁgures and tables are
unweighted averages of the countries in the group unless
noted to the contrary.
The use of the word countries to refer to economies
implies no judgment by the World Bank about the legal or

other status of a territory. The term developing countries
includes low- and middle-income economies and thus may
include economies in transition from central planning, as a
matter of convenience. The term developed countries or
industrial countries may be used as matter of convenience to
denote the high-income economies.
Dollar ﬁgures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise
speciﬁed. Billion means 1,000 million; trillion means 1,000
billion.

Foreword

We enter the new millennium with great hopes. For the ﬁrst time in human history, we have
the possibility of eradicating global poverty in our lifetime. One hundred and eighty heads
of state signed the Millennium Declaration in October 2000, pledging the world to meeting
the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In Monterrey, Mexico, in the spring of 2002,
the world’s nations established a partnership for increasing external assistance, expanding
world trade, and deepening policy and institutional reforms to reach these goals. Foreign
aid, which declined during the 1990s, has begun to increase again.
But the ﬁrst few years of the 21st century bring heightened challenges. HIV/AIDS and
other diseases, illiteracy, and unclean water threaten to dash the hopes of millions, possibly
billions, of people that they might escape poverty. Tragically, conﬂict has undermined development in many countries. Peace and development go hand in hand. And even as we learn
how to make development assistance more effective, aid continues to be criticized for not
being effective enough.
This year’s World Development Report, the 26th in the World Bank’s ﬂagship series, helps
to re-ignite and reinforce our hopes by confronting these challenges. Development is not
just about money or even about numerical targets to be achieved by 2015, as important as
those are. It is about people. The WDR focuses on basic services, particularly health, education, water, and sanitation, seeking ways of making them work for poor people. Too often,
services fail poor people. These failures may be less spectacular than ﬁnancial crises, but
their effects are continuing and deep nonetheless. The report shows that there are powerful
examples of services working for poor people. Services work when they include all the people, when girls are encouraged to go to school, when pupils and parents participate in the
schooling process, when communities take charge of their own sanitation. They work when
societies can curtail corruption—which hurts poor people more than it hurts the better
off—particularly when it hits basic health services, which poor people need desperately.
They work when we take a comprehensive view of development—recognizing that a
mother’s education will help her baby’s health, that building a road or a bridge will enable
children to go to school.
Services work especially well when we recognize that resources and their effective use are
inseparable. More effective use makes additional resources more productive—and the argument for aid more persuasive. External resources can provide strong support for changes in
policy and practice that can bring more effective use. This is how we can scale up to achieve
the Millennium Development Goals.
To improve service delivery, the WDR recommends institutional changes that will
strengthen relationships of accountability—between policymakers, providers, and citizens.
These changes will not come overnight. Solutions must be tailored not to some imaginary
“best practice” but to the realities of the country or the town or the village. One size will not

ﬁt all. But I am convinced that this new way of thinking about service delivery, and indeed
about development effectiveness, will bear fruit, particularly when matched with adequate
resources and a desire to assess what works and what does not, and to decide what must be
scaled up and, indeed, what must be scaled down.
In short, this year’s WDR is central to the World Bank’s two-pronged strategy for development—investing in and empowering people, and improving the climate for investment.
Next year’s WDR will focus on the second of these. Together, these reports form part of the
World Bank’s contribution to meeting the challenge the global community has set for
itself—to eradicate poverty in our lifetime.

oo often, services fail poor
people—in access, in quantity, in
quality. But the fact that there are
strong examples where services do
work means governments and citizens can
do better. How? By putting poor people at
the center of service provision: by enabling
them to monitor and discipline service
providers, by amplifying their voice in policymaking, and by strengthening the incentives for providers to serve the poor.

from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia tive, the argument for additional resources
becomes more persuasive. And external
resources can provide strong support for
changes in practice and policy to bring
about more effective use. The two are complementary—that is the essence of the
development partnership that was cemented
in Monterrey in the spring of 2002.
This Report builds an analytical and
practical framework for using resources,
whether internal or external, more effectively by making services work for poor
people. We focus on those services that
have the most direct link with human
development—education, health, water,
sanitation, and electricity.
Governments and citizens use a variety
of methods of delivering these services—
central government provision, contracting
out to the private sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGO)s, decentral-

ization to local governments, community
participation, and direct transfers to households. There have been spectacular successes and miserable failures. Both point to
the need to strengthen accountability in
three key relationships in the service delivery chain: between poor people and
providers, between poor people and policymakers, and between policymakers and
providers. Foreign-aid donors should reinforce the accountability in these relationships, not undermine it.
Increasing poor clients’ choice and participation in service delivery will help them
monitor and discipline providers. Raising
poor citizens’ voice, through the ballot box
and widely available information, can
increase their inﬂuence with policymakers—
and reduce the diversion of public services to
the non-poor for political patronage. By
rewarding the effective delivery of services
and penalizing the ineffective, policymakers
can get providers to serve poor people better.
Innovating with service delivery arrangements will not be enough. Societies should
learn from their innovations by systematically evaluating and disseminating information about what works and what doesn’t.
Only then can the innovations be scaled up
to improve the lives of poor people around
the world.
The challenge is formidable, because
making services work for poor people
involves changing not only service delivery
arrangements but also public sector institutions. It also involves changing the way much
foreign aid is transferred. As governments,
citizens, and donors create incentives for
these changes, they should be selective in the
problems they choose to address. They
should be realistic about implementation
difﬁculties. And they should be patient.

Poverty has many dimensions. In addition to
low income (living on less than $1 a day),
illiteracy, ill health, gender inequality, and
environmental degradation are all aspects of
being poor. This is reﬂected in the Millennium Development Goals, the international
community’s unprecedented agreement on
the goals for reducing poverty (box 1). The
multidimensional nature of poverty is also
reﬂected in the World Bank’s two-pronged
strategy for development—investing in people and improving the investment climate.
That ﬁve of the eight goals and one of the two
prongs of the strategy for development concern health and education signals how central
human development is to human welfare.
But progress in human development has
lagged behind that in reducing income
poverty (ﬁgure 1). The world as a whole is
on track to achieve the ﬁrst goal—reducing
by half the proportion of people living on
less than $1 a day—thanks mainly to rapid
economic growth in India and China, where
many of the world’s poor live.1 But the

world is off track in reaching the goals for
primary education, gender equality, and
child mortality.
To reach all of these goals, economic
growth is essential. But it will not be
enough. The projected growth in per capita
GDP will by itself enable ﬁve of the world’s
six developing regions to reach the goal for
reducing income poverty (table 1). But that
growth will enable only two of the regions to
achieve the primary enrollment goal and
none of them to reach the child mortality
goal. If the economic growth projected for
Africa doubles, the region will reach the
income poverty goal—but still fall short of
the health and education goals. In Uganda,
despite average annual per capita GDP
growth of 3.9 percent in the past decade,
child mortality is stagnating—and only
partly due to the AIDS epidemic.2
Because growth alone will not be enough
to reach the goals, the international community has committed itself—in a series of
recent meetings in Monterrey, Doha, and
Johannesburg—to greater resource trans-

Three points about the Millennium Development Goals: First, to be enduring, success in reaching the goals
must be based on systemwide reforms to support progress. Second, focusing on these outcomes does not
imply focusing on education and health services alone. Health and education outcomes depend on too many
other factors for that to work—everything from parents’ knowledge and behavior, to the ease and safety of
reaching a health clinic or school, or the technology available for producing outcomes (see crate 1.1).Third, in
countries that have already achieved universal primary completion or low infant and maternal mortality rates,
the spirit of the Millennium Development Goals—time-bound, outcome-based targets to focus strategies—
remains important.

fers by developed countries and better policies and institutions in developing countries. The level of resource transfers is difﬁcult to calculate precisely. Some estimates
are converging around a ﬁgure of $40 billion to $60 billion a year in additional foreign aid—so long as the money is accompanied by policy and institutional reforms to
enhance the productivity of domestic and
external resources.3
Focusing on the human development
goals, this Report describes the reforms in
services needed to achieve them. Ensuring
basic health and education outcomes is the
responsibility of the state (box 2). But many
governments are falling short on their obligation, especially to poor people. In Armenia
and Cambodia, child mortality rates for the
poorest ﬁfth of the population are two to
three times those for the richest ﬁfth. Only
about 60 percent of the adolescents in the
poorest ﬁfth of the population in the Arab
Republic of Egypt and Peru have completed
primary school, while all those from the
richest ﬁfth have.
To meet this responsibility, governments
and citizens need to make the services that
contribute to health and education—water,
sanitation, energy, transport, health, and education—work for poor people. Too often,
these services are failing. Sometimes, they are
failing everybody—except the rich, who can
opt out of the public system. But at other
times, they are clearly failing poor people.

Services are failing poor people
in four ways
How do we know that these services are failing poor people? First, while governments
devote about a third of their budgets to
health and education, they spend very little of
it on poor people—that is, on the services
poor people need to improve their health and
education. Public spending on health and
education is typically enjoyed by the nonpoor (ﬁgure 2). In Nepal 46 percent of education spending accrues to the richest ﬁfth, only
11 percent to the poorest. In India the richest
ﬁfth receives three times the curative health
care subsidy of the poorest ﬁfth.4 Even
though clean water is critical to health outcomes, in Morocco only 11 percent of the
poorest ﬁfth of the population has access to
BOX 2

Services—a public responsibility

By ﬁnancing, providing, or regulating the
services that contribute to health and education outcomes, governments around the
world demonstrate their responsibility for
the health and education of their people.
Why? First, these services are replete with
market failures—with externalities, as when
an infected child spreads a disease to playmates or a farmer beneﬁts from a
neighbor’s ability to read. So the private sector, left to its devices, will not achieve the
level of health and education that society
desires. Second, basic health and basic education are considered fundamental human

rights.The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights asserts an individual’s right to “a standard of living adequate for the health and
well-being of himself and of his family,
including . . . medical care . . . [and a right to
education that is] . . . free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages.” No matter how daunting the problems of delivery
may be, the public sector cannot walk away
from health and education.The challenge is
to see how the government—in collaboration with the private sector, communities,
and outside partners—can meet this fundamental responsibility.

safe water, while everybody in the richest ﬁfth
does (ﬁgure 3).
Second, even when public spending can
be reallocated toward poor people—say, by
shifting to primary schools and clinics—the
money does not always reach the frontline
service provider. In the early 1990s in
Uganda the share of nonsalary spending on
primary education that actually reached
primary schools was 13 percent. This was
the average: poorer schools received well
below the average.5
Third, even if this share is increased—as
the Ugandans have done—teachers must be
present and effective at their jobs, just as doctors and nurses must provide the care that
patients need. But they are often mired in a
system where the incentives for effective service delivery are weak, wages may not be
paid, corruption is rife, and political patronage is a way of life. Highly trained doctors seldom wish to serve in remote rural areas.
Since those who do serve there are rarely
monitored, the penalties for not being at
work are low. A survey of primary health care
facilities in Bangladesh found the absentee
rate among doctors to be 74 percent.6 When
present, some service providers treat poor
people badly. “They treat us like animals,”
says a patient in West Africa.7

By no means do all frontline service
providers behave this way. Many, often the
majority, are driven by an intrinsic motivation
to serve. Be it through professional pride or a
genuine commitment to help poor people (or
both), many teachers and health workers
deliver timely, efﬁcient, and courteous services, often in difﬁcult circumstances—
collapsing buildings, overﬂowing latrines—
and with few resources—clinics without
drugs, classes without textbooks.8 The challenge is to reinforce this experience—to replicate the professional ethics, intrinsic motivation, and other incentives of these providers
in the rest of the service work force.
The fourth way services fail poor people is
the lack of demand. Poor people often don’t
send their children to school or take them to a
clinic. In Bolivia 60 percent of the children
who died before age ﬁve had not seen a formal provider during the illness culminating
in their death. Sometimes the reason is the
poor quality of the service—missing materials, absent workers, abusive treatment. At
other times it is because they are poor. Even
when the services are free, many poor rural
families cannot afford the time it takes to
travel the nearly 8 kilometers to the nearest
primary school in Mali or the 23 kilometers
to the nearest medical facility in Chad.9

Overview

Weak demand can also be due to cultural
factors, notably gender. Some parents refuse
to send their daughters to school. Husbands
have been known to prevent their wives from
going to clinics—even for deliveries. And the
social distance between poor people and service providers (70 percent of nurses and midwives in rural Niger had been raised in the
city) is often a deterrent.

arrangements
Ensuring access to basic services such as
health, education, water, energy, and sanitation
is a public responsibility today, but it has not
always been. Nor do governments discharge
this responsibility solely through centralgovernment provision. Throughout history
and around the world, societies have tried different arrangements—with mixed results.

Some governments contract services
out—to the private sector, to NGOs,
even to other public agencies. In the
aftermath of a civil war Cambodia introduced two forms of contracting for
the delivery of primary health care
(“contracting out” whole services and
“contracting in” some services). Randomly assigning the arrangements
across 12 districts (to avoid systematic
bias), it found that health indicators, as
well as use by the poor, increased most in
the districts contracting out.10 Whether
this can be scaled up beyond 12 districts
in Cambodia is worth exploring.
Governments also sell concessions to the
private sector—in water, transport, electricity—with some very good and some
very bad results. Privatizing water in
Cartagena, Colombia, improved services
and access for the poor. A similar sale in
Tucuman, Argentina, led to riots in the
streets and a reversal of the concession.
Some societies transfer responsibility
(for ﬁnancing, provision, and regulation) to lower tiers of government.
Again, the record has varied—with
potentially weaker capacity and greater
political patronage at the local level and
the reduced scope for redistribution
sometimes outweighing the beneﬁts
from greater local participation. Local-

government delivery of infrastructure in
South Africa improved service provision
in a short time.11 But decentralizing
social assistance in Romania weakened
the ability and incentives of local councils to deliver cash transfers to the poor.12
The program is now being recentralized.
Responsibility is sometimes transferred to
communities—or to the clients themselves.
El Salvador’s Community-Managed Schools
Program (Educo) gives parents’ associations
the right to hire and ﬁre teachers. That, plus
the monthly visits to the schools by the parents’ associations, has reduced teacher—and
student—absenteeism, improving student
performance.
Still other programs transfer resources and
responsibility to the household. Mexico’s
Education, Health, and Nutrition Program
(Progresa) gives cash to families if their
children are enrolled in school and they
regularly visit a clinic. Numerous evaluations of the program show consistently
that it increased school enrollment (eight
percentage points for girls and ﬁve for
boys at the secondary level) and improved
children’s health (illness among young
children fell 20 percent).13

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

The framework of relationships—
between clients, providers,
and policymakers
To help understand the variety of experiences
with traditional and alternative service delivery arrangements, the service delivery chain
can be unbundled into three sets of actors,
and the relationships between them examined (ﬁgure 4). Poor people—as patients in
clinics, students in schools, travelers on buses,
consumers of water—are the clients of services. They have a relationship with the frontline providers, with schoolteachers, doctors,
bus drivers, water companies. Poor people
have a similar relationship when they buy
something in the market, such as a sandwich
(or a samosa, a salteña, a shoo-mai). In a
competitive-market transaction, they get the
“service” because they can hold the provider
accountable. That is, the consumer pays the
provider directly; he can observe whether or
not he has received the sandwich; and if he is
dissatisﬁed, he has power over the provider
with repeat business or, in the case of fraud,
with legal or social sanctions.
For the services considered here—such as
health, education, water, electricity, and
sanitation—there is no direct accountability
of the provider to the consumer. Why not? For
various good reasons, society has decided that
the service will be provided not through a
market transaction but through the government taking responsibility (see box 2). That is,
through the “long route” of accountability—
by clients as citizens inﬂuencing policymakers, and policymakers inﬂuencing providers.
When the relationships along this long route
break down, service delivery fails (absentee
teachers, leaking water pipes) and human
development outcomes are poor.

Figure 4 The framework of accountability
relationships
Policymakers

Consider the ﬁrst of the two relationships
along the long route—the link between poor
people and policymakers or politicians (ﬁgure 4). Poor people are citizens. In principle,
they contribute to deﬁning society’s collective
objectives, and they try to control public
action to achieve those objectives. In practice,
this does not always work. Either they are
excluded from the formulation of collective
objectives or they cannot inﬂuence public
action because of weaknesses in the electoral
system. Free public services and “no-show”
jobs are handed out as political patronage,
with poor people rarely the beneﬁciaries.
Even if poor people can reach the policymaker, services will not improve unless the
policymaker can ensure that the service
provider will deliver services to them. In
Cambodia, policymakers were able to specify
the services required to the NGOs with
whom they contracted. But for many services, such as student learning or curative
care, the policymaker may not be able to
specify the nature of the service, much less
impose penalties for underperformance of
the contract. Teacher and health-worker
absenteeism is often the result.
Given the weaknesses in the long route of
accountability, service outcomes can be
improved by strengthening the short route—
by increasing the client’s power over
providers. School voucher schemes (Colombia’s PACES) or scholarships (Bangladesh’s
Female Secondary School Assistance Program, in which schools receive a grant based
on the number of girls they enroll) enable
clients to exert inﬂuence over providers
through choice. El Salvador’s Educo program
and Guinea’s revolving drug scheme (where
co-payments inspired villagers to stop theft)
are ways for client participation to improve
service provision.14
Turn now to a closer look at the individual
relationships in the service delivery chain—
why they break down, how they can be
strengthened.

ple may not be able to inﬂuence politicians
about public services: they may not be well
informed about the quality of public services
(and politicians know this); they may vote
along ethnic or ideological lines, placing less
weight on public services when evaluating
politicians; or they may not believe the candidates who promise better public services—
because their term in ofﬁce is too short to
deliver on the promise—and they may vote
instead for candidates who provide ready
cash and jobs.
As a result, public services often become
the currency of political patronage and clientelism. Politicians give “phantom” jobs to
teachers and doctors. They build free public
schools and clinics in areas where their supporters live. Former Boston mayor James
Curley strengthened his political base by concentrating public services in the Irish
Catholic areas while denying them to the
Protestants, who eventually moved to the
suburbs.15
In 1989 Mexico introduced PRONASOL
(Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, or
National Solidarity Program), a poverty alleviation program that spent 1.2 percent of
GDP annually on water, electricity, nutrition,
and education construction in poor communities. Assessments of the six-year program
found that it reduced poverty by only about
3 percent. Had the budget been distributed
to maximize its impact on poverty, the
expected decline would have been 64 percent. It would have been 13 percent even
with an untargeted, universal proportional
transfer to the whole population. The reason
becomes apparent when one examines the
political afﬁliation of communities that
received PRONASOL spending. Municipalities dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the party in power,
received signiﬁcantly higher per capita transfers than those voting for another party (ﬁgure 5).16
Just as a well-functioning democracy does
not guarantee that poor people will beneﬁt
from public services, some one-party states
get good health and education outcomes—
even among the poor. Cuba has among the
best social indicators in Latin America—at a
much lower income than its peers, such as
Chile and Costa Rica. China reduced infant

mortality dramatically, and achieved nearly
universal primary enrollment. To be sure, in
China, cases during the earliest phase of the
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 were not openly reported—
thus making its further spread almost
inevitable. And Cubans, who had high levels
of health and education in the 1950s, remain
poor on other dimensions.17
The lesson seems to be that the citizenpolicymaker link is working either when citizens can hold policymakers accountable for
public services that beneﬁt the poor or when
the policymaker cares about the health and
education of poor people. These politics are
“pro-poor.”
What can be done when the politics are
not pro-poor? Societies can still introduce
various intermediate elements to make public institutions more accountable. Participatory budgeting in Porto Allegre, Brazil,
started as a means for the citizens to participate in budget formulation and then to hold
the municipal government accountable for
executing the budget.
Perhaps the most powerful means of
increasing the voice of poor citizens in policymaking is better information. When the
government of Uganda learned that only 13
percent of recurrent spending for primary
education was arriving in primary schools, it
launched a monthly newspaper campaign on
the transfer of funds. That campaign galvanized the populace, inducing the government

to increase the share going to primary schools
(now over 80 percent) and compelling school
principals to post the entire budget on the
schoolroom door.
The media can do much to disseminate
information about public services. Higher
newspaper circulation in Indian districts is
associated with better local-government performance in distributing food and drought
relief.18 The more people who can read, the
stronger the inﬂuence of the media. In Kerala, India, this led to a virtuous cycle of literacy leading to better public services, which
raised literacy even more.19
But information is not enough. People
must also have the legal, political, and economic means to press demands against the
government. Most citizens in Uttar Pradesh,
India, know that government services are
dismal, and know that everyone else knows
that—and yet most do not feel free to
complain.20

Policymakers and providers—
stronger compacts

Policymakers

Providers

Strengthening poor people’s voice can
make policymakers want to improve services for the poor. But they still may not be
able to. Well-intentioned policymakers
often cannot offer the incentives and do the
monitoring to ensure that providers serve
the poor. The absenteeism of teachers, the
rude treatment of patients, and the siphoning of pharmaceuticals are symptoms of
the problem.
Even in the private sector, where the
incentives presumably are better aligned, performance is not much better—for the same
reasons that private markets are not the solution to these problems in the ﬁrst place. Private providers fail to reach the very poor.
Weak regulation leads to poor-quality health
services in India’s private sector. Ineffectively
privatizing water incites riots in the streets of
Cochabamba.
In the former Soviet Union, state and
party control over providers ensured compliance with delivery norms for free services.
Services worked, and levels of health status,
particularly for the poorer Central Asian
republics, were much higher than for other
countries at their level of income. But the
breakup of the Soviet Union weakened state

control over providers, and health and education services collapsed.
Solving the problem requires mentally,
and sometimes physically, separating the
policymaker from the provider—and thinking of the relationship between the two as a
compact. The provider agrees to deliver a
service, in return for being rewarded or
penalized depending on performance. The
compact may be an explicit contract with a
private or nonproﬁt organization—or
between tiers of government, as in Johannesburg, South Africa.21 Or it could be
implicit, as in the employment agreements
of civil servants.
Separating the policymaker from the
provider is not easy, for those who beneﬁt
from the lack of separation may resist it.
Teachers’ unions in Uttar Pradesh, India,
blocked an attempt to put teacher hiring,
ﬁring, and attendance under the control of
the village panchayat. On the other hand,
health professionals in Brazil participated in
a national coalition that prepared the plan
for health reforms and municipal health
councils.22 The separation usually happens
because of a ﬁscal crisis (Johannesburg), a
major political change (decentralization in
Latin America), or a legacy of history (public regulation of water providers in the
Netherlands).
Even with a separation of policymaker
and provider, the compacts cannot be too
explicit. It is difﬁcult to specify precisely what
the schoolteacher should do at every point in
the day. Too much speciﬁcity can lead to
inﬂexibility. Parisian taxi drivers, to make a
point about excessive regulations, sometimes
meticulously follow the rules in the Code de la
route—slowing trafﬁc in the French capital to
a snail’s pace.23
Since the contract cannot be fully speciﬁed, policymakers look to other means of
eliciting pro-poor services from providers.
One way is to choose providers who have an
intrinsic motivation to serve the poor. A
study of faith-based health care providers in
Uganda estimates that they work for 28 percent less than government and private forproﬁt staff, and yet provide a signiﬁcantly
higher quality of care than the public sector.24 Another way is to increase incentives
to serve the poor or work in underserved

Overview

areas. But one study of Indonesia shows
that it would require multiples of current
pay levels to get doctors to live in West
Papua, for instance (where the vacancy rate
is 60 percent).25 A third way is to solicit bids
for services and use the competition in the
bidding process to monitor and discipline
providers. Many water concessions are managed this way. A recent innovation in Madhya Pradesh, India, allows NGOs to compete
for concessions to primary schools, with
payments conditional on higher test scores
based on independent measurement.
As with the citizen-politician relationship,
a critical element in the policymakerprovider relationship is information. The
policymaker can specify a contract based only
on what he can observe—on what information is available. There has to be a method for
monitoring providers and for having that
information reach the policymaker. New
technologies, including e-government, can
make this easier.26
So can some ingenious methods using
human beings. When Ceará, Brazil, hired a
cadre of district health workers, the government sent their names to the applicants who
were not selected, inviting them to report any
problems with service in the health clinics.
More fundamentally, these output-based
incentive schemes require rigorous program
evaluation, so that the policymaker knows
and understands what is working and what
isn’t. Evaluation-based information, important not only for monitoring providers, also
enables the rest of the world to learn about
service delivery.

Clients and providers—more
choices, more participation
Given the difﬁculties in strengthening the long
route of accountability, improving the short
route—the client-provider relationship—
deserves more consideration. There is no
question that this relationship is broken for
hundreds of millions of poor people. Voices
of the Poor and other surveys point to the
helplessness that poor people feel before
providers—nurses hitting mothers during
childbirth, doctors refusing to treat patients of
a lower caste.27 Unlike most private providers,
public water companies funded through budgetary transfers often ignore their customers.

These are but symptoms of the larger problem: many service delivery arrangements
neglect the role of clients, especially poor
clients, in making services work better.
Clients can play two roles in strengthening
service delivery. First, for many services,
clients can help tailor the service to their
needs, since the actual mix cannot be speciﬁed
in advance. In some parts of Pakistan, girls are
more likely to attend school if there is a female
teacher. The construction of separate latrines
for girls has had a strong effect on girls’ enrollment in primary schools. When the opening
hours of health clinics are more convenient
for farmers, visits increase. Second, clients can
be effective monitors of providers, since they
are at the point of service delivery. The major
beneﬁt of Educo came from the weekly visits
of the community education association to
schools. Each additional visit reduced student
absenteeism (due to teacher absenteeism) by 3
percent.28
How can the role of clients in revealing
demand and monitoring providers be
strengthened? By increasing poor people’s
choice and participation in service delivery.
When clients are given a choice among service providers, they reveal their demand by
“voting with their feet.” Female patients who
feel more comfortable with female doctors
can go to one. The competition created by
client choice also disciplines providers. A
doctor may refuse to treat lower-caste
patients, but if he is paid by the number of
patients seen, he will be concerned when the
waiting room is empty. Reimbursing schools
based on the number of students (or female
students) they enroll creates implicit competition among schools for students, increasing
students’ choice.
School voucher programs—as in Bangladesh, Chile, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, and
Czech Republic—are explicitly aimed at
improving education quality by increasing
parents’ choices. The evidence on these
schemes is mixed, however. They seem to
have improved student performance among
some groups. But the effects on the poor are
ambiguous because universal voucher
schemes tend to increase sorting—with
richer students concentrating in the private
schools.29 When the voucher is restricted to
poor or disadvantaged groups, the effects are

better.30 The Colombia program showed
lower repetition rates and higher performance on standardized tests for students participating in the scheme—with the effect for
girls higher than that for boys.31 Even in network systems such as urban water provision,
it is possible to give poor communities
choice—by allowing the poor to approach
independent providers, introducing ﬂexibility in service standards such as lifeline rates,
and so on.
When there is no choice of providers,
increasing poor people’s participation in service provision—giving them the ability to
monitor and discipline the provider, for
example—can achieve similar results. Clients
can play the role of monitors since they are
present at the point of service. But they need
to have an incentive to monitor.
In Bangladesh, thanks to reduced import
tariffs, households were able to purchase
tubewells that tapped ground sources—shallow aquifers—for drinking water. Unfortunately, no one arranged for the monitoring of
water quality—a public good—so the arsenic
in the water went undetected. If the stakes are
high enough, communities tackle the problem. When the Zambian government introduced a road fund ﬁnanced by a charge on
trucks, truck drivers took turns policing a
bridge crossing to make sure that overloaded
trucks did not cross. Of course such copayments or user fees reduce demand—and
so should not be used when the demand
effects outweigh the increase in supply, as in
primary education. But for water, electricity,
and other services whose beneﬁts are enjoyed
mainly by the user, charging for them has the
added beneﬁt of increasing the consumer’s
incentive to monitor the provider. Farmers in
Andhra Pradesh, India, are ﬁnding that, when
they pay for their water, the irrigation department becomes more accountable to them. In
the words of one farmer, “We will never allow
the government to again give us free water.”32

Donors and recipients—
strengthening accountability,
not undermining it
Improving service outcomes for poor people
requires strengthening the three relationships
in the chain—between client and provider,
between citizen and policymaker, and

between policymaker and provider. In their
zeal to get services to the poor, donors often
bypass one or more of these relationships.
The typical mode of delivering aid—a
project—is often implemented by a separate
unit outside the compact, bypassing the relationship between policymakers and providers. The project is typically ﬁnanced by
earmarked funds subject to donor-mandated
ﬁduciary requirements. It and other donor
initiatives, including global “funds,” bypass
the citizen-policymaker relationship where
the budget is concerned. To be sure, when the
existing relationship is dysfunctional, it may
be necessary to go around it. But the cases
where the beneﬁts outweigh the costs are
probably fewer than imagined.
Recognizing the gap between ends and
means, some donors and recipients try to use
foreign aid to strengthen, not weaken, the
links in the service delivery chain. One
approach is to incorporate donor assistance
in the recipient’s budget, shifting to the recipient’s accountability system. In Uganda assistance from Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, and the
World Bank is all part of the country’s budget, the outcome of a coordinated and participatory process.
Another approach is for donors to pool
their assistance in a single “pot” and to harmonize their ﬁduciary standards around that
of the rest of the government. The sectorwide
approach to health, education, transport, and
other sectors is a step in this direction. Possibly the biggest payoff comes when donors
help generate knowledge—as when donorﬁnanced impact evaluation studies reveal
what works and what doesn’t in service delivery, or when donors pool technical assistance
resources at the retail level, as in the multidonor Water and Sanitation Program.
Knowledge is essential to scaling up service
delivery. Although it emerges locally, it is a
global public good—precisely what aid is
designed to ﬁnance.

What not to do
The picture painted so far of the difﬁculties in
government-led service delivery may lead
some to conclude that government should
give up and leave everything to the private
sector. That would be wrong. If individuals

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

02_WDR_Overview.qxd 8/14/03 7:26 AM Page 11

Overview

are left to their own devices, they will not
provide levels of education and health that
they collectively desire (see box 2). Not only
is this true in theory, but in practice no
country has achieved signiﬁcant improvement in child mortality and primary education without government involvement. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, private
sector or NGO participation in health, education, and infrastructure is not without
problems—especially in reaching poor people. The extreme position is clearly not
desirable.
Some aid donors take a variant of the
“leave-everything-to-the-private-sector” position. If government services are performing
so badly, they say, why give more aid to those
governments? That would be equally wrong.
There is now substantial research showing
that aid is productive in countries with good
policies and institutions, and those policies
and institutions have recently been improving.33 The reforms detailed in this Report
(aimed at recipient countries and aid agencies) can make aid even more productive.
When policies and institutions are improving, aid should increase, not decrease, to realize the mutually shared objective of poverty
reduction, as speciﬁed in the Millennium
Development Goals.
At the same time, simply increasing public
spending—without seeking improvements in
the efﬁciency of that spending—is unlikely to
reap substantial beneﬁts. The productivity of
public spending varies enormously across
countries. Ethiopia and Malawi spend
roughly the same amount per person on primary education—with very different outcomes. Peru and Thailand spend vastly different amounts—with similar outcomes.
On average, the relationship between
public spending on health and education
and the outcomes is weak or nonexistent. A
simple scatter plot of spending and outcomes shows a clear line with a signiﬁcant
slope—because richer countries spend more
on health and education and have better outcomes. But controlling for the effect of per
capita income, the relationship between
public spending on health and under-ﬁve
mortality rates is not statistically signiﬁcant
(ﬁgure 6). That is not surprising: most public
spending on health and education goes to

the non-poor, much of it fails to reach the
frontline service provider, and service
providers face weak incentives to deliver services effectively.
Linked to the “simply-increase-publicspending” approach is one that advocates for
more foreign aid without accompanying
measures to improve the productivity of foreign aid. This can be just as misleading—and
not just for the same reasons that simply
increasing public expenditure is misleading.
Sometimes the modes of delivering foreign
aid, by undermining rather than strengthening service delivery in the recipient country,
can reduce the productivity of public spending in the medium run.
Finally, when faced with disappointing
health and education outcomes, especially
for poor people, it is tempting to recommend a technical solution that addresses the
proximate cause of the problem. Why not
give vitamin A supplements, de-worm
schoolchildren, and train teachers better?
Why not develop a “minimum package” of
health interventions for everybody?
Although each intervention is valuable, recommending them alone will not address
the fundamental institutional problems
that precluded their adoption in the ﬁrst
place.34 Lack of knowledge about the right
technical solution is probably not the binding constraint. What is needed is a set of
institutional arrangements that will give

policymakers, providers, and citizens the
incentives to adopt the solution and adapt it
to local conditions.

What can be done?

yes

Pro-poor?

no

The varied experience with traditional and
innovative modes of service delivery clearly
shows that no single solution ﬁts all services
in all countries. The framework of accountability relationships explains why. In different sectors and countries, different relationships need strengthening. In education the
biggest payoff may come from strengthening the client-provider link, as with vouchers in Colombia or scholarships for girls in
Bangladesh. But that may not be so in
immunization campaigns.
Furthermore, poor people are often
trapped in a system of dysfunctional servicedelivery relationships. Making just one link
more effective may not be enough—it may
even be counterproductive—if there are serious problems elsewhere in the service delivery chain. In water or curative health care,
tightening the policymaker-provider link
could make providers respond more to the
demands of their superiors—and less to
their poor clients. Relying on user groups,
often generously funded by donors, may
inhibit the development of genuinely democratic local governments. Finally, countries,
and regions within countries, vary enormously in the conditions that make service
innovations work. A failed state mired in
conﬂict will be overstretched in resources
and institutional capacity, and able to manage only certain interventions. Countries
with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS will
require short- and long-term adaptations of
the service delivery systems.
Does this mean there are no general
lessons about making services work for
poor people? No. The experience with service delivery, viewed through the lens of
this Report, suggests a constellation of
solutions, each matching various characteristics of the service and the country or
region. While no one size ﬁts all, perhaps
eight sizes do. Even eight may be too few,
which is why some of the “sizes” are
adjustable, like waistbands.
The eight sizes can be arrived at by
answering a series of questions.

Pro-poor or clientelist politics?
How much is the political system in the
country geared toward pro-poor public services—and how much does it suffer from
clientelist politics and corruption? This is the
most difﬁcult dimension for an outside actor,
such as a donor, to address: the recipient of
the advice may also be the source of the problem. And politics do not change overnight.
Even so, at least three sets of policy instruments can be deployed where the politics are
more clientelist than pro-poor.

•

•

•

First is choosing the level of government
responsible for the service. Countries differ in the patronage politics and capabilities of different tiers of government—
and this should inform the service
delivery arrangement.
Second, if politicians are likely to capture
the rents from free public services and
distribute them to their clients, an
arrangement that reduces the rents may
leave the poor better off. This might
include transparent and publicly known
rules for allocation, such as per-student
grants to schools, or conditional transfers
to households, as in Progresa. In some
cases it may include fees to reduce the
value of the politicians’ distribution decisions. India’s power sector was nationally
owned and run because it was a network
(and therefore not amenable to head-tohead competition). But the huge rents
from providing subsidized electricity
have been diverted to people who are not
poor—all within a parliamentary democracy. Reducing those rents by raising
power tariffs or having the private sector
provide electricity, even if it violates the
principles of equity—they are already
violated in the existing system—may be
the only way of improving electricity services to the poor.
Third, better information—that makes
citizens more aware of the money allocated to their services, the actual conditions of services, and the behavior of
policymakers and providers—can be a
powerful force in overcoming clientelist
politics. The role of a free and vibrant
press and improving the level of public
discourse cannot be overstated.

Overview

Homogeneous or heterogeneous
clients?
The answer to this question depends on the
service. Students with disabilities have special
needs for quality education but not for
immunization. Heterogeneity is also deﬁned
by regional or community preferences.
Whether a girl goes to school may depend on
whether there are separate latrines for boys
and girls. If that depends on local preferences,
the village should have a say in design. Previously homogeneous societies, such as Sweden
and Norway, are changing with increased
immigration. They are giving more discretion to local communities in tailoring the
education system to suit the linguistic abilities of their members.
The more that people differ in their
desires, the greater the beneﬁts from decentralizing the decision. In the most extreme
case—when individual preferences matter—
the appropriate solution will involve individual choices of service (if there is the possibility of competition) and such interventions as
cash transfers, vouchers, or capitation payments to schools or medical providers. If
there are shared preferences, as in education,
or free-rider problems as in sanitation, the
community is the correct locus of decisionmaking. The appropriate policy will then
involve local-government decisions in a
decentralized setting—or depending on
political realities, community decisions (as
for social investment funds) and user groups
(such as parents in school committees).

Easy or hard to monitor?
Services can be distinguished by the difﬁculty
of monitoring service outputs. The difﬁculty
depends on the service and on the institutional capacity of government to do the monitoring. At one extreme are the services of
teachers in a classroom or doctors in a clinic.
Both transactions allow much discretion by
the provider that cannot be observed easily. A
doctor has much more discretion in treating
a patient than an electrician switching on a
power grid. And it is difﬁcult to know when
high-quality teaching or health care is being
provided. It may be possible to test students.
But test scores tell very little about the
teacher’s ability or effort, since they depend at
least as much on students’ socioeconomic

status or parental involvement. More easily
monitored are immunizations and clean
latrines—all measurable by a quantitative,
observable indicator.
Of course it depends on who is doing the
monitoring. Parents can observe whether the
teacher is in attendance, and what their children are learning, more easily than some central education authority. Better management
information systems and e-government can
make certain services easier to monitor. And
monitoring costs can be reduced by judicious
choice of providers—such as some NGOs,
which may be trustworthy without formal
monitoring. In short, the difﬁculty of monitoring is not ﬁxed: it can vary over time and
with policies.

Eight sizes ﬁt all
Now examine different combinations of
these characteristics, to see which service
delivery arrangement would be a good ﬁt—
and which would be a misﬁt (ﬁgure 7). To be
sure, none of the characteristics can be easily
divided into such clean categories, because
countries and services lie on a continuum.
Even so, by dividing the salient characteristics, and looking at various combinations, the
“eight sizes ﬁt all” approach can be applied to
the considerations spelled out earlier.
Central government ﬁnancing with contracting (1). In a favorable political context,
with agreement on what government should
do, an easy-to-monitor service such as
immunization could be delivered by the
public sector, or ﬁnanced by the public sector and contracted out to the private or nonproﬁt sector, as with primary health centers
in Cambodia.35 Infrastructure services could
be managed by a national utility or provided
by the private sector with regulatory oversight.
Note that the particular conﬁguration in
which this arrangement will work is special.
In the developed countries there is much
discussion of a set of reforms, started in New
Zealand, that involve greater use of explicit
contracts—either from the government to
the private sector, or from central ministries
to the ministries responsible for speciﬁc services. The New Zealand reforms are justiﬁed
by a well-established public sector ethos,

reasonable management information systems, and supporting institutions, including

These features increase the “monitorability”
of certain services by reducing the gap
between contracted and realized outcomes.
These preconditions do not exist in many
developing countries, so the template of these
reforms cannot be used mechanically.36 If
there is no good legal system and the civil service is subject to bribes (a form of clientelist
politics), private sector contracts might be a
major source of corruption. In these countries, government should perhaps be even
more output-oriented—not as a means of
tweaking a well-functioning system but as a
way of getting the system to provide much
greater improvements in services and generating new information.
Central government provision (2). When the
service is difﬁcult to monitor—explicit con-

tracts are difﬁcult to write or enforce—but
the politics are pro-poor and clients homogeneous, the traditional, centralized public
sector is the appropriate delivery system.
The French education system, which administers a uniform service centrally, is one of
the best examples.37 But too many countries
fall into the trap of thinking that just
because the service is difﬁcult to monitor, it
must be delivered by the government. When
students are heterogeneous, when the politics of the country are not geared toward
poor people, government control of the
education system—with no participation by
students, parents, or local communities—
can leave the poor worse off.
Local government ﬁnancing with contracting
(3). With heterogeneous preferences, local
governments should be involved in services.
When local politics are pro-poor (but
national politics aren’t), local governments
could be more reliable ﬁnanciers of services,
and vice versa. Easily monitored services such
as water or electricity can be contracted out to
public or private utilities, as in Johannesburg.
Local government (or deconcentrated central government) provision (4). For difﬁcultto-monitor services, such as education (for
quality), management responsibility might
be ceded to parent groups when the politics
are conducive, as in the Educo program.
Giving clients a choice through vouchers
enables them to express their heterogeneous
preferences. And the competition created by
clients having a choice may improve service
quality—as with water vouchers in Chile or
sanitation vouchers in Bangladesh.
Client power (5, 6, 7, 8). When publicly
ﬁnanced services are subject to capture—the
politics are not pro-poor—the best thing to
do is to strengthen the client’s power as
much as possible. But that can be difﬁcult.
Even means-tested voucher schemes or subsidies could be diverted to the non-poor.
Transparent, rule-based programs, such as
Progresa in Mexico, are needed to make it
difﬁcult to hide middle-class capture.
In services such as water and electricity,
governments intervene to regulate monopoly
providers and protect the poor—and not

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

02_WDR_Overview.qxd 8/14/03 7:28 AM Page 15

Overview

because there are signiﬁcant externalities. So
separating the policymaker from the provider,
and making the provider accountable to the
client through prices, can strengthen client
power and lead to better results. Poor people
can be protected from high prices if charges
rise with use (with an initial, free amount).
Allowing small, independent water providers
to compete with the local monopoly can also
discipline provision and keep prices down.
But prices—without accompanying subsidies or transfers to poor people—cannot be
used to strengthen client power in education
because of the externalities in primary education. A market-based allocation would not be
in society’s interest. The same applies to
health services with externalities, such as
immunization. In curative health care, the
asymmetry of information between client
and provider makes strengthening client
power problematic. Better information on
preventive care or on how to choose medical
providers (possibly disseminated by nonproﬁt organizations) can ameliorate the
problem. In extreme cases, it may be that only
community groups or altruistic nonproﬁts
can effectively provide these services to poor
people.38
These service delivery arrangements represent efforts to balance problems with the long
route of accountability (clientelist politics,
hard-to-monitor services) with the short
route. The reason societies choose the long
route is that there are market failures or
concerns with equity that make the traditional short route—consumers’ power over
providers—inadequate. But the “government
failures” associated with the long route may be
so severe that, in some cases, the market solution may actually leave poor people better off.

Eight sizes ﬁt all with adjustable
waistbands
The foregoing simpliﬁed scheme captures
only part of the story. At least two features are
left out.
Failed states. Countries where the state is failing (often countries in conﬂict) need service
delivery arrangements different from those
where the state is fairly strong. Primary school
completion rates in Senegal and the Democratic Republic of Congo are about 40 percent.

In Senegal—a stable democracy—the reforms
in education, including those that strengthen
client-provider links, would go through the
government (to strengthen the policymakerprovider links as well). In the Democratic
Republic of Congo—where conﬂict has signiﬁcantly weakened the state—ways should
be found to empower communities to
improve education services—even if it means
bypassing government ministries in the short
to medium term. Social funds and community-driven development are examples. They
can be effective in improving service outcomes, but concerns about their sustainability
and scalability—and whether they crowd out
the growth of local government capacity—
should not be overlooked.
History. The country’s history can also have
a bearing on which service delivery arrangements are likely to succeed. Until the 19th
century, the education systems of Britain
and France were private and the church was
the dominant provider. The government
had an incentive to develop an oversight
mechanism to ensure that the schools
taught more than just religion. That proved
valuable when education was nationalized
in these countries: the systems continued to
run with strong regulatory oversight.
Water providers in the Netherlands started
as private companies, making the concept of
water as an economic good, and charging for
it, acceptable. When the system was shifted to
municipal ownership, pricing remained. Even
if the Dutch never introduce private participation in water, they have achieved the separation between policymaker and provider. In
sum, a country’s history can generate the
incentives for certain institutions to develop—
and those institutions can make the difference
in whether a particular service arrangement
succeeds or fails.

Sectoral service reforms
What do these conclusions tell us about the
reform agenda in individual sectors? In education there is a tradeoff between the need
for greater central authority to capture societywide beneﬁts, such as social cohesion,
and the need for greater local inﬂuence
because student learning is difﬁcult to
monitor at the central level. The tradeoff is

sharper when the concern is the quality of
education rather than the quantity. In
Indonesia centralized public delivery of
education has enrolled children in schools,
but it has been less successful in teaching
them valuable skills. To increase the quality
of education, therefore, reforms should
concentrate on increasing the voice and
participation of clients—but not neglect
the importance of central government oversight. In practical terms, this would call for
more community management of schools
and demand-side subsidies to poor people,
but with continuing stress on nationally
determined curricula and certiﬁcation.
Governments intervene in health to control communicable diseases, protect poor
people from impoverishing health expenditures, and disseminate information about
home-based health and nutrition practices.
Each of these activities is different, yet they
are often provided by the same arrangement,
such as a central government public health
system. They should be differentiated.

•

•
•

Information about hand washing, exclusive breastfeeding, and nutrition can be
delivered (and even ﬁnanced) by NGOs
and other groups, delivery that works
best when reinforced by the community.
Outreach services, such as immunizations, can be contracted out but should
be publicly ﬁnanced.
Clinical care is the service the client is
least able to monitor, but the case in
which government failures might swamp
market failures. Where the politics are
extremely pro-rich, even public ﬁnancing of these services (with private provision) can be counterproductive for poor
people. The non-poor can capture this
ﬁnancing, leaving no curative services
for the poor—and no room in the budget for public health services. Strengthening client power, through either
demand-side subsidies or co-payments,
can improve matters for poor people,
even if there is asymmetric information
between client and provider.

In the infrastructure sectors—such as
water, sanitation, transport, and energy—the
rationale for government intervention is dif-

Spotlight on “spotlights”

In addition to the usual assortment of boxes and
examples to illustrate particular points, this

particularly important service delivery innovation or experience.The purpose of these spotlights is to tell the story behind these
innovations or experiences, and provide a balanced perspective on the evidence.

ferent from that in education and health, and
so should be the policy responses. The main
reason for government involvement in water
and energy provision is that those services are
provided through networks, so direct competition is not possible. Governments also intervene to ensure access by poor people to these
services. So the role of government is to regulate and in some cases subsidize production
and distribution. There are few advantages to
the government’s providing the service itself,
which explains why the past decade has seen
many privatizations, concessions, and the like
in water and energy.
Whether delivered by a private or public
company, the service needs to be regulated.
Who that regulator is will determine service
outcomes. At the very least, when the company is public, the regulator should be separate from the provider (when the policymaker and provider are indistinguishable,
making this separation is all the more difﬁcult). The situation is worse when water or
energy is subsidized, because the sizable rents
from this subsidy—the beneﬁts of belowmarket-rate services—can be captured by
politicians, who use them to curry favor with
their rich clients rather than the poor.
Sanitation is different because individuals
can ofﬂoad their refuse onto their neighbors.
So subsidies to individual households will
not solve the collective action problem.
Instead, using community-level subsidies,
and giving communities the authority to
allocate them, puts the locus of authority
where the external effects of individual
behavior can be contained.

Scaling up

that developing countries will have a chance

Overview

of meeting the Millennium Development
Goals? First, as noted at the beginning of this
Report, additional resources—external and
internal—will be needed to capitalize on
these reforms. Second, these reforms must be
embedded in a public sector responsible for
ensuring poor people’s access to basic services. This means that the sectoral reforms
must be linked to ongoing (or nascent) public sector reforms in such areas as budget
management, decentralization, and public
administration reform. It also means that a
well-functioning public sector is a crucial
underpinning of service delivery reform. In
the same vein, there should be reform in
donor practices—such as harmonizing procedures and making more use of budget
support—to strengthen recipient countries’
efforts to improve service outputs.
Third, a recurring theme in this Report is
what information can do—as a stimulant for
public action, as a catalyst for change, and as
an input for making other reforms work.
Even in the most resistant societies, the creation and dissemination of information can
be accelerated. Surveys of the quality of service delivery conducted by the Public Affairs
Centre in Bangalore, India, have increased
public demand for service reform. The surveys have been replicated in 24 Indian states.
The public expenditure tracking survey in
Uganda is another example, as is the Probe
report on India’s education system.
Beyond surveys, the widespread and systematic evaluation of service delivery can have
a profound effect on progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Evaluations
based on random assignments, such as Mexico’s Progresa, or other rigorous evaluations
give conﬁdence to policymakers and the public that what they are seeing is real. Governments are constantly trying new approaches
to service delivery. Some of them work. But
unless there is some systematic evaluation of
these programs, there is no certainty that they
worked because of the program or for other
reasons. Based on the systematic evaluations
of Progresa, the government has scaled up the
program to encompass 20 percent of the
Mexican people.
The beneﬁts of systematic program evaluation go beyond the program and the country.
These evaluations tell policymakers in other

countries what works and what doesn’t. They
are global public goods—which might explain
why they are so scarce.39 If these evaluations
are global public goods, the international community should ﬁnance them. One possibility
would be to protect the 1.5 percent of World
Bank loans that is supposed to be used for
evaluation (but rarely is), so that this sum—
about $300 million a year—could be used to
administer rigorous evaluations of projects
and disseminate the results worldwide.
In addition to creating and disseminating
information, other reforms to improve service
delivery will require careful consideration of
the particular setting. There is no silver bullet
to improve service delivery. It may be known
how to educate a child or stop an infant from
dying. But institutions are needed that will
educate a generation of children or reduce
infant mortality by two-thirds. These do not
crop up overnight. Nor will a single institutional arrangement generate the desired
results. Everything from publicly ﬁnanced
central government provision to userﬁnanced community provision can work (or
fail to work) in different circumstances.
Rather than prescribe policies or design
the optimal institution, this Report
describes the incentives that will give rise to
the appropriate institution in a given context. Decentralization may not be the optimal institutional design. But it may give
local governments the incentives to build
regulatory capacity that, in turn, could make
water and energy services work better for
poor people. NGO service provision might
be effective in the medium run, as it has
been in education in Bangladesh. But the
incentives it creates for the public sector to
stay out of education make it much harder
to scale up or improve quality—as Bangladesh is discovering today. Many of these
institutions cut across the public sector—
budgetary institutions, intergovernmental
relations, the civil service—which reinforces
the notion that service delivery reform
should be embedded in the context of public
sector reform
In addition to looking for incentives to
generate the appropriate institutions, governments should be more selective in what
they choose to do. The experience with service delivery teaches us the importance of

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

implementation. Singapore and Nigeria
(both former British colonies) have similarly
designed education systems. But in implementation, the outcomes, especially for poor
people, could not be more different. Governments and donors often overlook implementation difﬁculties when designing policies.
There may be beneﬁts to having the central
government administer schools (such as
social cohesion). But the problems with central provision of a hard-to-monitor activity
such as primary education are so great, especially among heterogeneous populations, that
the government should rethink its position of
centrally controlled schools. Selectivity is not
just about choosing from the available design
options—it is about choosing with an eye
toward options that can be implemented.
That there is no silver bullet, that we
should be looking for incentives that give

rise to appropriate institutions, that we
need to be more realistic about implementation in choosing among options—all
imply that these reforms will take time.
Even if we know what is to be done, it may
be difﬁcult to get it done. Despite the urgent
needs of the world’s poor people, and the
many ways services have failed them, quick
results will be hard to come by. Many of the
changes involve fundamental shifts in
power—something that cannot happen
overnight. Making services work for poor
people requires patience. But that does not
mean we should be complacent. Hubert
Lyautey, the French marshal, once asked his
gardener how long a tree would take to
reach maturity. When the gardener
answered that it would take 100 years, Marshal Lyautey replied, “In that case, plant it
this afternoon.”

chapter

With seven other children to care for, Maria’s
mother, Antonia Souza Lima, explained that she
could not afford the time—an hour-and-a-half
walk—or the 40-cent bus fare to take her listless
baby to the nearest medical post. Maria seemed
destined to become one of the 250,000 Brazilian
children who die every year before turning 5. But
in a new effort to cut the devastating infant mortality rate here, a community health worker
recently started to walk weekly to the Lima household, bringing oral rehydration formula for Maria
and hygiene advice for her mother, who has a television set but no water ﬁlter. Once a month, the
7,240 workers in the Ceará health program enter
the homes of four million people, the poor majority of a state where most people’s incomes are less
than $1 a day. Erismar Rodrigues de Lima, a
neighbor of the Limas, listened intently to instructions on ﬁltering drinking water. “I am the ﬁrst
member of my family to ever receive prenatal
care,” said the 22-year-old woman, who is expecting a baby in June.
From the New York Times40
I go to collect water four times a day, in a 20-litre
clay jar. It’s hard work! . . . I’ve never been to
school as I have to help my mother with her washing work so we can earn enough money. I also
have to help with the cooking, go to the market to
buy food, and collect twigs and rubbish for the
cooking ﬁre. Our house doesn’t have a bathroom. I
wash myself in the kitchen once a week, on Sunday. At the same time I change my clothes and
wash the dirty ones. When I need the toilet I have
to go down to the river in the gully behind my
house. I usually go with my friends as we’re only
supposed to go after dark when people can’t see us.
In the daytime I use a tin inside the house and
empty it out later. If I could alter my life, I would
really like to go to school and have more clothes.

Citizens and governments can make services
that contribute to human development work
better for poor people—and in many cases
they have. But too often services fail poor
people. Services are failing because they are
falling short of their potential to improve

outcomes. They are often inaccessible or prohibitively expensive. But even when accessible, they are often dysfunctional, extremely
low in technical quality, and unresponsive to
the needs of a diverse clientele. In addition,
innovation and evaluation—to ﬁnd ways to
increase productivity—are rare.
Many services contribute to improving
human welfare, but this Report focuses on
services that contribute directly to improving
health and education outcomes—health services, education services, and such infrastructure services as water, sanitation, and energy.
“Services” include what goes on in schools,
clinics, and hospitals and what teachers,
nurses, and doctors do. They also include
how textbooks, drugs, safe water, and electricity reach poor people, and what information campaigns and cash transfers can do to
enable poor people to improve outcomes
directly. Much of all this is relevant for other
sectors, such as police services, so the Report
features examples from those sectors as well.
Just how bad can services be? Testimonies
show that they can be very bad. In Adaboya,
Ghana, poor people say that their “children
must walk four kilometers to attend school
because, while there is a school building in
the village, it sits in disrepair and cannot be
used in the rainy season.”42 In Potrero Sula, El
Salvador, villagers complain that “the health
post here is useless because there is no doctor
or nurse, and it is only open two days a week
until noon.”43 A common response in a client
survey by women who had given birth at
rural health centers in the Mutasa district of
Zimbabwe is that they were hit by staff during delivery.44
This chapter illustrates many types of
failures—inaccessible or unaffordable services, and various shortfalls in quality—using
testimonials from poor people, compilations

of data from several countries, and in-depth
studies. The chapter also provides examples
of services that are working for poor people.
Learning from success and understanding the
sources of failure require a framework for
analysis. Chapters 3 to 6 of the Report present
and develop that framework; Chapters 7 to
11 consider options and issues for reform.

Just how bad are outcomes? Rates of illness
and death are high—and rates of school
enrollment, completion, and learning are
low—especially for poor people (box 1.1). In
Cambodia under-ﬁve mortality is 147 per
1,000 births among the poorest ﬁfth of the
population; in Armenia it is 63 (ﬁgure 1.1).45
Many children are unlikely to complete even
primary schooling. Among adolescents 15 to
19 years old in Egypt, only 60 percent in the
poorest ﬁfth have completed the ﬁve years of
primary school (ﬁgure 1.2). In Peru only 67
percent of youths in the poorest ﬁfth have
ﬁnished the six-year primary cycle, even
though almost all started school. In both
countries nearly all adolescents in the richest
ﬁfth of the population completed primary

school.46 These countries are not special
cases. Worldwide more than 100 million children of primary school age are not in primary school.47 Almost 11 million children,
roughly the population of Greece or Mali, die
before their ﬁfth birthday.48
Most countries have rich-poor differentials in education or health outcomes. This is
not necessarily evidence of services failing
poor people—there are many determinants
of outcomes (see crate 1.1 at the end of this
chapter).49 Comparing outcomes for richer
and poorer people within countries highlights two things. First, it shows the absolutely
bad outcomes among the poor—for example, in Bolivia 143 children of every 1,000
from the poorest quintile died before their
ﬁfth birthday, and in Niger fewer than 10 percent of adolescents from the poorest quintile
completed grade 6. Second, within-country
comparisons give a sense of the possible—
that is, speciﬁc goals already being reached
within a country.

Who are “poor people”?

Deﬁning who is “poor” is always a difﬁcult proposition because there are several concepts of poverty.
Perhaps most familiar is the one used to identify the
poor in sample surveys in low-income countries: that
is based on a composite measure of total household
consumption per member (with adjustments for
household size and composition).50 “Poor people”
are then deﬁned as those living in households below
a particular threshold of this measure of consumption, such as below $1 or $2 a day, or below a nationally deﬁned level.
An alternative approach divides the population
into various groups, for example, quintiles, according
to a ranked ordering of the measure.The poorest
quintile or poorest ﬁfth, for example, is the 20 percent of people who live in households with the lowest values of the consumption measure.
Many surveys, including some used in this
Report, do not include consumption data, which
are difﬁcult to collect. One approach to assigning
people to quintiles is to aggregate indicators of a
household’s asset ownership and housing characteristics into an index, and then to rank households
according to this index. To distinguish these
approaches in this Report, quintiles based on the

latter method are typically referred to as “asset” or
“wealth” quintiles (since asset ownership and housing characteristics are arguably reﬂections of a
household’s wealth).51
But poverty based on consumption,“wealth,” or
an alternative derived from income, is not the only
social disadvantage that creates difﬁculties in the
demand for and provision of services. Gender can
exclude women from both household and public
demands for better services. In many countries ethnicity or other socially constructed categories of disadvantage are important barriers. People with physical and mental disabilities are often not
accommodated by education and health services.
Even broader concepts of poverty are relevant to
effective services.“Poor people” include people experiencing any of the many dimensions of poverty—
and those vulnerable or at risk of poverty—in lowincome and lower middle-income countries.52 So
poor people can be seen as the “working class,” or
“popular” in Spanish, or simply just “not rich.” Even in
middle-income countries the “poor” includes a large
part of the population: much of the population cannot insulate itself from the consequences of failures
of public services.

03_WDR_Ch01.qxd 8/14/03 7:34 AM Page 21

Services can work for poor people but too often they fail

facilities, rural transport, and other services is
limited. For children in Aberagerema village
in Papua New Guinea, the nearest school is in
Teapopo village, an hour away by boat, two
hours by canoe.53 This is not unusual: the
average travel time to the nearest school in
that country is one hour.54 The availability of
services varies dramatically across countries.
Typically, however, poor people need to travel
substantial distances to reach health and education services—and often much longer distances than richer people in the same country. In rural Nigeria children from the poorest
ﬁfth of the population need to travel more
than ﬁve times farther than children in the
richest ﬁfth to reach the nearest primary
school, and more than seven times farther to
reach the nearest health facility (table 1.1).
And traveling theses distances can be hard. In
Lusikisiki village, South Africa, it may be necessary to hire neighbors to carry a sick person
uphill to even reach the nearest road, which
may be inaccessible during the rainy season.55
On top of this, staff are getting rarer in
some parts of the world. There is mounting
evidence that AIDS is reducing the pool of
people able to become teachers or health professionals (box 1.2), and international labor
markets are making it hard to keep qualiﬁed
medical staff in poor countries (chapters 6
and 8).
Coverage of other services is also far from
universal. More than a billion people worldwide have no access to an improved water
source, and 2.5 billion do not have access to
improved sanitation. In Africa only half the
rural population has access to improved
water or improved sanitation. In Asia only 30
percent of the rural population has access to
improved sanitation.56 Again, there are large
variations across and within countries. In
Cambodia 96 percent of the richest ﬁfth of
the population has access to an improved
drinking water source, but just 21 percent of
the poorest ﬁfth does (ﬁgure 1.3). In
Morocco in 1992, 97 percent of the richest
ﬁfth of the population had access to an
improved water source, but just 11 percent of
the poorest ﬁfth did. In Peru the corresponding shares are 98 percent and 39 percent.57
This need not be. Indonesia expanded
access to primary education in the mid-1970s
by using its oil windfall to build new schools

and hire more teachers. Primary enrollment
doubled between 1973 and 1986, reaching 90
percent—though the story on quality is less
positive.58 Despite a limited budget El Salvador expanded access to schooling in poor
rural communities after a civil war in the
1980s by using innovative institutional
arrangements (see Educo spotlight).
The exact relationship between use of services and prices or family income varies, but
for poor people, lower incomes and higher
prices are associated with less use.59 Poor people spend a lot of their money on services: 75
percent of all health spending in low-income
countries is private, 50 percent in middleincome countries.60 Based on government
sources, these broad aggregates are probably
underestimates, hiding the heavier burden on
poor people. And poor people often need to
pay more for the same goods. For example,
poor people often pay higher prices to water
sellers than the better-off pay to utilities
(chapter 9). In Ghana the approximate price
paid per liter for water purchased by the
bucket was between 5 and 16 times higher
than the charge for public supply, even
though women and children often had to
walk a long distance to purchase the water. In
Pune, India, low-income purchasers of water
paid up to 30 times the sale price of the
metered water that middle- and upperincome households used.61
The poor also lack the collateral needed to
formally borrow to pay for expensive services
for which they lack insurance, and therefore
resort to informal moneylenders who charge
very high interest rates. If this ﬁnancing
channel is unavailable, they use more expensive traditional or private providers who
often provide more ﬂexibility in the terms of
payment.62
This need not be. In Egypt making health
insurance available to school children in the
early 1990s almost doubled the probability of a
health facility visit among the poorest ﬁfth of
the population, substantially reducing the
rich-poor gap.63 In Mexico an innovative program—Progresa—provided parents with cash
transfers if they attended health education lectures (where they also received nutrition supplements), and family members got regular
medical checkups. The impact of this combination of higher income and facility visits was

signiﬁcant: illnesses among children under ﬁve
fell by about 20 percent (see spotlight).

Quality—a range of failures
Lack of access and unaffordability are just two
ways services fail. In low- and middle-income
countries alike, if services are available at all
they are often of low quality. So, many poor
people bypass the closest public facility to go
to more costly private facilities or choose better quality at more distant public facilities. An
in-depth study of the Iringa district in Tanzania, a poor rural area, showed that patients
bypassed low-quality facilities in favor of
those offering high-quality consultations and
prescriptions, staffed by more knowledgeable
physicians, and better stocked with basic supplies.64 A study in Sri Lanka found similar
behavior, with patient demand for quality
varying with the severity of the illness.65
One result: underused publicly funded
clinics. In the Sheikhupura district of rural

Punjab, Pakistan, only about 5 percent of sick
children were taken for treatment to rural
primary health care facilities; half went to
private dispensaries, and the others to private
doctors.66 When quality improves, the
demand for services increases—even among
poor clients.67

Services are often dysfunctional
Ensuring that positions are ﬁlled, that staff
report for work, and that they are responsive
to all their clients is a major challenge. The
more skilled the workers, the less likely they
are to accept a job as a teacher or a health
worker in a remote area. A recent study in
Bangladesh found 40 percent vacancy rates
for doctor postings in poor areas.68 In Papua
New Guinea, with a substantial percentage of
teaching positions unﬁlled, many schools
closed because they could not get teachers.69
Incentive payments might encourage professionals to work in remote areas, but they can

HIV/AIDS is killing
teachers

Many countries lack reliable data on AIDS-related
deaths and HIV prevalence among teachers, but
the available information suggests rising teacher
mortality in the presence of HIV/AIDS.For example:
In the Central African Republic 85 percent of
teachers who died between 1996 and
1998 were HIV-positive. On average they
died 10 years before they were due to
retire.
In Zambia 1,300 teachers died in the ﬁrst 10
months of 1998, compared with 680
teachers in 1996.
In Kenya teacher deaths rose from 450 in
1995 to 1,500 in 1999 (reported by the
Teaching Service Commission), while in
one of Kenya’s eight provinces 20 to 30
teachers die each month from AIDS.
HIV-positive teachers are estimated at more
than 30 percent in parts of Malawi and
Uganda, 20 percent in Zambia, and 12
percent in South Africa.

(2002h).

be expensive. A study in Indonesia estimated
that doctors would need to be paid several
times their current salaries to induce them to
go to the most remote areas.70
Even when positions are ﬁlled, staff
absence rates can be high. In random visits to
200 primary schools in India, investigators
found no teaching activity in half of them at
the time of visit.71 Recent random samples of
schools and health clinics in several developing countries found absence rates over 40 percent, with higher rates in remote areas and for
some kinds of staff—although there is wide
variation within countries (tables 1.2 and
1.3). Earlier studies have found similar results.
Up to 45 percent of teachers in Ethiopia were
absent at least one day in the week before a
visit—10 percent of them for three days or
more.72 Health workers in rural health centers
in Honduras worked only 77 percent of the
possible days in the week before a visit.73 In
rural Côte d’Ivoire only 75 percent of doctors
were in attendance on the day before a visit.74
Staff alone cannot ensure high-quality
services. They also need the right materials—
books in schools, drugs in clinics. Studies in
Ghana and Nigeria in the early 1990s found

Services can work for poor people but too often they fail

diarrhea in children under ﬁve, and even
fewer cases correctly treated or advised. For
example, in Zambia only 30 percent of cases
were correctly assessed, and only 19 percent
correctly rehydrated.89 Another study in
Egypt found only 14 percent of acute cases of
diarrhea were treated appropriately with oral
rehydration salts.90 A recent study in Benin
found that one in four sick children received
unnecessary or dangerous drugs from health
workers.91 In India the contamination of
injection needles used by registered medical
practitioners was alarmingly widespread.92
Even though technical quality is more difﬁcult to identify in basic education, some
indicators raise alarm. For example, spending
is ineffectively allocated, with substantially
more going to teacher salaries relative to other
factors that would be more efﬁcient.93 Or time
is misspent: in ﬁve Middle Eastern and North
African countries primary school students
spend only about 65 percent of the potential
time actually on task.94 In Indonesia ﬁrst and
second grade students ofﬁcially spend only
2.5 hours a day in school, and absences and
classroom time spent on administrative tasks
reduced time spent learning even further.95

Services are not responsive to clients
Services also fail in the interaction between
provider and client. Clients are diverse: they
differ by economic status, religion, ethnicity,
gender, marital status, age, social status, caste.
They may also differ in the constraints on
their time, their access to information and
social networks, or their civic skills and ability
to act collectively. The inequalities between
these groups are mirrored in the relationship
between clients and providers.96 In India districts with a higher proportion of lower castes
and some religious groups have fewer doctors
and nurses per capita, and health outreach
workers are less likely to visit lower-caste and
poor households.97 Clients report that they
value health facilities that are open at convenient times, with staff who treat them with
respect. In El Salvador infrequent and inconvenient operating hours greatly reduced the
use of health posts. According to focus group
respondents: “Health posts operate only
twice a week. Waiting time is three hours on
average. Only those who arrive by 8 a.m. get a
consultation.”98 In Sub-Saharan Africa school

often starts at 8 a.m. while girls are still fetching water, and school holidays are at odds
with local market dates.
The “social distance” between providers
and their clients can be large. In Niger, a
mainly rural country, a study found 43 percent of the parents of nurses and midwives
were civil servants, and 70 percent of them
had been raised in the city. All of them went to
work by car—a rarity in that country.99 Sad
consequences of the social distance between
providers and clients are not hard to ﬁnd. In
Egypt participants in a discussion group complained about the attitude of staff at the local
rural hospital, with one respondent summing
up the experience: “They have their noses up
in the air and neglect us.”100 In South Africa a
focus group member comments about a primary health care provider: “Sometimes I feel
as if apartheid has never left this place. . . .
They really have a way of making you feel like
you are a piece of rubbish.”101
Services must be relevant—ﬁlling a perceived need—or there will be little demand
for them (box 1.3). If primary schools teach
skills relevant only for secondary school—and
not for life outside of school—only children
from richer families who expect to continue
to the secondary level will deem it worthwhile
to complete primary school. In Ghana one
respondent claimed: “School is useless: children spend time in school and then they’re
unemployed and haven’t learned to work on
the land.”102 In India one component of an
integrated childhood development program
failed when beneﬁciaries rejected the food

BOX 1.3

School services for girls are not in high demand
in Dhamar Province, Yemen

“At the back of the classroom of 40 boys sat
2 girls. . . .What did the girls want to be when
they grew up? ‘A teacher,’ one said. ’A doctor,’ said the other. But less than a quarter of
the women in Yemen are literate, and they
must follow the path of the traditional village women, who usually marry in their
teens and have an average of 10 children. In
the countryside of Dhamar Province, one of
the country’s poorest, there are few professional activities for anyone, much less for
women. Besides, most parents won’t let their
daughters go to school—deeming it unac-

ceptable for them either to learn alongside
boys or to walk to class in the street.“
In Yemen girls make up about one in
three students at the primary level, one in
four at the secondary level. More than 75
percent of women over 15 are illiterate,
compared with 35 percent of men. Girls’
education is not the only problem, however.
The net enrollment rate for boys is only 75
percent at the primary level, 70 percent at
the secondary level.

grain supplied. Eventually the program
changed what it offered to match varying
preferences in different parts of the country.
And again, this need not be. In the Nioki
area of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic
of Congo), where the use of health services
declined substantially between 1987 and
1991, it increased in clinics with nurses who
had good interpersonal skills.103 Among
indigenous peoples in Bolivia, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru, promoting bilingual and intercultural education
contributed to improved schooling outcomes.104 An innovative public health campaign among sex workers in Sonagachi,
India, trained “peer educators” to pass information to their co-workers. Disseminating
information in this way resulted in more condom use and substantially less HIV infection
than in other cities. The approach had knockon effects as well: sex workers organized a
union and effectively lobbied for legalization,
reduction in police harassment, and other
rights.105

Little evaluation, little innovation,
stagnant productivity
In most settings there are few evaluations of
new interventions, and so no effective innovation and improvement in the productivity
of services. Evaluating innovative service
arrangements—such as new forms of
accountability—is rarer still. If systems don’t
build in ways of learning about how to do
things better, it should be no surprise when
they stagnate. Relying on research from other
countries, while useful, is not enough. Finding out how a particular intervention works
in each country setting is crucial, since history, politics, and institutions determine what
works, what doesn’t, and why.
Once again, this need not be. Although
rarely carried out, some programs have tried
to incorporate evaluation components to
learn about the program. Mexico’s Progresa
explicitly included randomization and evaluation in its design. The results of the evaluation—well documented and disseminated in
the media—helped solidify support for the
program. They showed what was most effective, contributing to the program’s extension
to a large part of the country’s poor people
(see spotlight). But even without an experi-

mental design, it is possible to learn about
systems and to innovate. For example, the
Probe study in India documented a variety of
shortcomings of the quality of primary
schools. The widely publicized results contributed to mobilizing support for reform.106

Making services work
to improve outcomes
Many of the examples discussed so far
describe failures in the public sector’s provision of services, but they are not the only
story. The 20th century has seen enormous
improvements in living standards. Life
expectancy has improved dramatically in
nearly every country. The expansion of
schooling has been similarly remarkable. In
nearly every country illiteracy has been
reduced dramatically, enrollment rates have
gone up, and the average schooling of the
population has more than doubled. Civil service bureaucracies providing good services
have been integral elements of those successes. In many settings staff must overcome
major obstacles—including threats to their
own safety—in order to teach children or
provide care to the sick.
What do services that work look like? Safe
and pleasant schools with children learning
to read and write. Primary clinics with health
workers dispensing proper advice and medicine. Water networks distributing safe and
dependable water. Direct subsidies to poor
children and their families encouraging
demand. Services that are accessible, affordable, and of good quality—helping to
improve outcomes for poor people.
Governments take on a responsibility to
make services work in order to promote
health and education outcomes. Chapter 2
addresses the reasons for this responsibility,
dwelling on three seemingly straightforward
ways to discharge it: relying solely on economic growth, allocating public spending, or
applying technical ﬁxes. None of them is
enough by itself. Making services work
requires improving the institutional arrangements for producing them. Chapters 3 to 6 of
this Report develop a framework for analyzing those arrangements. Chapters 7 to 11
apply the framework and draw lessons for
governments and donors.

Determinants of health and education outcomes—within, outside,
and across sectors

Health and education outcomes are
determined by more than the availability and
quality of health care and schooling. Better
nutrition helps children learn. Better refrigeration and transport networks help keep medicines safe. Many factors determine outcomes
on both the demand and the supply sides,
linked at many levels.The demand for health
and education is determined by individuals
and households weighing the beneﬁts and
costs of their choices and the constraints they
face.The supply of services that affect health
and education outcomes starts with global
technological knowledge and goes all the way
to whether teachers report for work and communities maintain water pumps.
Demand: individuals and households
Beneﬁts and costs determine how much an
individual invests in education or health.
What are the beneﬁts? Higher levels of education and health are associated with higher
productivity—and higher earnings. Investing
in human capital is a way to get those

returns. But the returns might vary for different people, such as lower expected earnings
for women or for ethnic minorities. In these
cases one would expect different levels of
investment: different desired levels of schooling, for instance. A crucial element of
demand is the degree to which individuals
rather than society reap the rewards. Goods
with large positive externalities—in the
extreme, public goods—will be demanded at
less than the socially optimal level.
What are the costs? There are direct
costs: user fees, transport costs, textbook
fees, drug costs. Some of these can be borne
by families—though not all families. Coping
mechanisms for those that cannot are often
hard to use. For example, the lack of insurance markets can make it hard to absorb
the ﬁnancial burden of sudden illness. Or
the inability to borrow against future earnings can make it hard to borrow for schooling investments.
Indirect costs can also be large. For example, children often contribute to household

income by working inside or outside the
home (looking after siblings, working on the
family farm).The value of this contribution is
forgone if they spend substantial time in
school.
The total cost of illness includes days of
work lost recovering, seeking care, or looking
after the ill. Richer families can cope better
with these costs, which leads to a direct association between income and outcomes. In
addition, better health and education are
often valued in themselves. As incomes
increase families demand more of them,
which again results in an association
between income and outcomes.
The production of health and education
depends on the knowledge and practices of
adults in households.This works through
both the demand for human capital and the
generation of outcomes. A review of four
hygiene interventions that targeted hand
washing in poor countries found 35 percent
less diarrhea-related illness among children
who received the interventions. And factors

and across sectors (continued)

in the home complement schooling: books
and reading at home contribute to literacy.
Investments in the human capital of children are sensitive to the allocation of power
within households: families in which the bargaining power of women is stronger tend to
invest more in health and education. A study
in Brazil found that demand for calories and
protein was up to 10 times more responsive
to women’s than men’s income.This result,
strongest in societies that proscribe women’s
roles, tends to affect girls more than boys.
More generally, the roles and responsibilities of different household members can
affect how investments are made. A woman
in Egypt says:“We face a calamity when my
husband falls ill. Our life comes to a halt until
he recovers.” Her husband’s earnings are crucial for sustaining the family. Since productivity is related to illness, households respond.
In Bangladesh a study found that household
members who engaged in more strenuous
activities received more nutritious food.
Daughters’ education might be less valuable
to parents if sons typically look after them in
their old age, so parents might be less willing
to send girls to school.
Demand: links between sectors at
individual and household levels
Health and nutritional status directly affects
a child’s probability of school enrollment and
capacity to learn and succeed in school. Malnutrition among children was associated
with signiﬁcant delays in school enrollment
in Ghana. Improving child health and nutrition at the pre-primary level has long-term
impacts on development. A study in the
Philippines found that a one-standard-deviation increase in early-age child health
increased subsequent test scores by about a
third of a standard deviation.
Improving the health and nutritional status of students positively affects school
enrollment and attendance. A longitudinal
study in Pakistan found that a one-third of a
standard deviation increase in child height
increased school enrollment by 19 percentage points for girls and 4 percentage points
for boys. An evaluation of school-based mass
treatment for deworming in rural Kenya
found that student absenteeism fell by a
quarter—but test scores did not appear to
be affected. Improving nutrition is not as simple as supplementary feeding at school:
households can reallocate resources with the
effect of “sharing” that food. A study in the
Philippines found no such sharing in general,

but for a school snack program there was
sharing in poorer families.
Parents’ education has intergenerational
effects on the health, nutritional status, and
schooling of their children. Adult female education is one of the most robust correlates of
child mortality in cross-national studies, even
controlling for national income. Similarly,
mother’s education is a strong determinant
of lower mortality at the household level,
though the relationship weakens when other
household and community socioeconomic
characteristics are controlled for. A large part
of this effect might not be general education
but speciﬁc health knowledge, perhaps
acquired using literacy and numeracy skills
learned in school, as a study in Morocco
found.The effects can also be interspatial: a
study in Peru found that the education of a
mother’s neighbors signiﬁcantly increases
the nutritional status of her children. Parents’
education is similarly associated with the
schooling of their children, though the magnitude of the effect—and the relative roles of
mother’s and father’s education—vary substantially across countries.
Access to—and use of—safe water, as
well as adequate sanitation, have direct
effects on health status. Hand washing is a
powerful health practice, but it requires sufﬁcient quantities of water. An eight-country
study found that going from no improved
water to “optimal” water was associated with
a 6-percentage-point reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea in children under three
years of age (from a base of 25 percent) in
households without sanitation. Nutritional
status was likewise associated with access to
improved water. But not all studies ﬁnd
strong associations between water source
and better health.
The water source is only part of the story:
in Bangladesh water accessed through tubewells—an “improved” source— is frequently
contaminated with arsenic. One study found
that arsenic levels higher than the World
Health Organization’s maximum acceptable
level are associated with twice the level of
diarrhea in children under age six. Extremely
high levels of arsenic are associated with
shorter stature among adolescents.
The same eight-country study mentioned
above found that going to “optimal”
sanitation from none was associated with a
10-percentage-point drop in recent diarrhea
in households with no improved water
source. As in education, there are spillover
effects: sanitation practices at the community

level impact everyone’s health. In Peru the
sanitation investments of a family’s neighbors
were associated with better nutritional status
for that family’s children.
The use of safe energy sources affects
both health and education. Indoor air pollution—from using dirty cooking and heating
fuels—hurts child health. One review of
studies found that the probability of respiratory illness, or even death, was between
two and ﬁve times higher in houses where
exposure to indoor air pollution was high. A
study in Guatemala found birth weights 65
grams lower among newborns of women
who used wood as a domestic cooking fuel.
Coping with the cold, in cold climates,
affects health and imposes substantial
direct and indirect costs on households.
Education is affected as well: schools have
to close when there is not enough heat, and
it is hard to imagine that working on
schoolwork at home is an option when
indoor temperatures are below freezing.
Supply: global developments
At any given income, health and education
outcomes have been improving. A continuing trend in improvements in health going
back several decades is interpreted as
advances in technologies and leaps in
knowledge about health and hygiene. More
recently, at a national income of $600 per
capita, predicted child mortality fell from
100 per 1,000 births to 80—a full 20
percent reduction—between 1990 and
2000. If this association were sustained,
major headway would be made toward the
Millennium Development Goal through
these changes alone. Major breakthroughs
in immunizations for malaria—or HIV—
could have a huge impact on mortality at
all income levels.
Recent years have seen major developments in global funding for health and education expenditures. Debt relief through the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative is
tied to increases in expenditures on these
sectors. New assistance, delivered through
multisectoral products such as Poverty
Reduction Support Credits, requires explicit
strategies for human development
investments. Global funds for health and the
“Fast-Track Initiative” for education are international pledges to support initiatives in the
sectors (chapter 11). Easing ﬁnancial
constraints goes hand in hand with using
resources effectively to support services that
work for poor people.

C R AT E 1 . 1

Determinants of health and education outcomes—within, outside,
and across sectors (continued)

Supply: national resources
National income is strongly associated with
child mortality and primary school completion. Income and health and education outcomes build on each other. More income
leads to better human development
outcomes, and better health and education
can lead to increased productivity and better
incomes. Studies that have tried to disentangle these relationships typically ﬁnd income
to be a robust and strong determinant of
outcomes.
National endowments are also a strong
determinant. Geography and climate sometimes make it tougher to overcome health
problems. For example, areas conducive to
mosquito survival have great difﬁculty in combating malaria—and widely dispersed populations are difﬁcult to serve through
traditional school systems.
The performance of public expenditure in
producing outcomes varies substantially across
countries.There are large differences in
achievements at similar levels of expenditure
and similar achievements with very large differences in expenditures—conditional on income.
Spending more through the public sector is not
always associated with improved outcomes.
This is not to say that spending cannot be helpful—but the way resources are used is crucial
to their effectiveness.
Supply: political, economic,
and policy context
Governance affects the efﬁciency of expenditures: in corrupt settings money that is ostensibly earmarked for improving human development outcomes is diverted. Staffs
ostensibly delivering services do not. But the
effects of poor governance can be deeper.
Famines are caused as much by human factors as by nature. And the repercussions run
across national borders. For example, a
drought combined with misguided policies
and bad governance in Zimbabwe resulted
in a regional food shortage.
Managing public expenditures can be a
critical link in ensuring that allocated expenditures get put to uses that improve
outcomes.“Cash budgeting” in Zambia led to
unpredictable social service spending and
deep cuts in spending on rural infrastructure.
Conﬂict leaves long-lived scars on health
and education. Children in war-torn countries
are hard to ﬁnd, hard to get into school, and
hard to keep in school. During Sierra Leone’s
recent civil war, tens of thousands of children
attended primary school but hundreds of

thousands did not. Wars, including civil wars,
lead to “lost generations” of undernourished
and undereducated children.These deﬁciencies are difﬁcult—if not impossible—to make
up for. When children have been out of
school for a long time, it is hard to return.
And bad health and poor nutrition at an early
age affect children throughout their lives.
Periods of national economic and social
crisis can result in bad health and education
outcomes.This is clear in Russia’s recent history: adult mortality has increased dramatically over the past 10 years. Sustained
economic depression can severely compromise children’s health and have cascading
effects on subsequent development and
learning.The evidence of shorter-term economic crises is more mixed. In middleincome environments school enrollments
might increase as the opportunity cost of
time for young people falls. Even in Indonesia, a relatively poor country, the deep
economic and social crisis of the late 1990s
had smaller impacts on outcomes than initially feared.This was partly because broad
social safety nets were rapidly put in place.
Supply: the local context of government
and communities
Decentralization can be a powerful tool for
moving decisionmaking closer to those
affected by it. Doing so can strengthen the
links and accountability between policymakers and citizens—local governments are
potentially more accountable to local
demands. It can also strengthen them
between policymakers and providers—local
governments are potentially more able to
monitor providers. But local governments
should not be romanticized. Like national
governments they are vulnerable to
capture—and this might be easier for local
elites on a local scale.
Community-level institutions, shaped by
cultural norms and practices, can facilitate
or hinder an environment for improving
outcomes. A review of safe-water projects in
Central Java, Indonesia, associates success
with greater social capital. In Rajasthan,
India, manifestations of “mutually beneﬁcial
collective action” were associated with
watershed conservation and development
activities more generally. A broader review
of the literature suggests that participatory
approaches to implementing projects are
more successful in communities with less
economic inequality and less social and ethnic heterogeneity.

Supply: services and their ﬁnancing
Services themselves are important. Inaccessible or poor-quality services raise the
effective price of health care and schooling,
which results in higher mortality and lower
educational achievement. Poor-quality
schools deter enrollment and reduce
attainment and achievement, especially
among children of poor families. Health
clinics where the technical skills of staff are
so bad as to be dangerous will lead to
higher mortality. Lack of water will signiﬁcantly hurt child health.
Financing arrangements matter. Absorbing the burden of unpredictable large expenditures through health insurance can reduce
impoverishment, which in turn will affect
outcomes. Financing primary schooling
might seem relatively minor: direct costs are
typically small. Even so, a lack of access to
credit has been found to be associated with
lower school enrollment. Borrowing to pay
the direct costs of primary school is almost
unheard of, but there could be second-round
effects if the lack of access to credit means
that families need children to engage in
home production.
Supply: services working together to
produce outcomes
Links among services are critical. Vaccines
can become less effective, ineffective, or
even dangerous if they get too hot, freeze,
or are exposed to light. The ability to transport and store vaccines properly thus
determines the success of immunization
campaigns. In cold climates schools and
health facilities often need to close because
of the lack of heating, and dependable
energy sources can directly affect health
and education outcomes. The accessibility
of services can be a deterrent to their use:
roads and adequate transport contribute to
the total cost of using a service. Since the
expected return to education determines
the beneﬁts of schooling, labor markets
that are not fundamentally distorted (for
example, through discriminatory practices
toward marginalized groups) can
contribute to higher education
achievement. Services therefore need to
work together to promote improved
outcomes.

Progresa

Conditional cash transfers to reduce poverty in Mexico
Progresa, the Education, Health, and Nutrition Program of Mexico, transferred money directly to families on the condition that family members went for health checkups, mothers went for hygiene and nutrition information sessions, and
children attended school. By documenting success through rigorous evaluation, the program has improved, scaled up,
and taught others.107

W

hen Ernesto Zedillo became
Mexico’s president in 1995, a
ﬁfth of the population could
not afford the minimum daily nutritional
requirements, 10 million Mexicans lacked
access to basic health services, more than
1.5 million children were out of school,
and student absenteeism and school desertions were three times higher in poor and
remote areas than in the rest of the country. The country had a history of unproductive poverty alleviation programs.
Worse, the 1994–95 economic crisis left the
government with even fewer resources—
and greater demands, as more people were
falling into poverty.
The administration decided that a new
approach to poverty alleviation was needed. The Education, Health, and Nutrition
Program of Mexico, called Progresa, introduced a set of conditional cash transfers to
poor families—if their children were
enrolled in school and if family members
visited health clinics for checkups and
nutrition and hygiene information.
The program was intended to remedy
several shortcomings of earlier programs.
First, it would counter the bias in poor families toward present consumption by bolstering investment in human capital.
Second, it would recognize the interdependencies among education, health, and
nutrition. Third, to stretch limited
resources, it would link cash transfers to
household behavior, aiming at changing
attitudes. Fourth, to reduce political interference, the program’s goals, rules, requirements, and evaluation methods would be
widely publicized.
The program has been rigorously evaluated, and evaluators have exploited the randomized way the program was rolled out.
The results have been impressive. To
emphasize the apolitical nature of the program, the government suspended the
growth of the program for six months prior
to the election in 2000—to show that
Progresa was not a political tool.

When President Vincente Fox was elected, his government embraced the program,
built on it using the evaluation results,
expanded it to urban areas, and renamed it
Oportunidades. By the end of 2002 the program had about 21 million beneﬁciaries—
roughly a ﬁfth of the Mexican population.

Designing a comprehensive
program
Children over seven were eligible for education transfers. Beneﬁts increased by grade
(since opportunity costs increase with age)
and were higher for girls in middle school,
to encourage their enrollment. To retain the
beneﬁts, children needed to maintain an 85
percent attendance record and could not
repeat a grade more than once.
Eligible families could also receive a
monthly stipend if members got regular medical checkups and mothers attended monthly
nutrition and hygiene information sessions.
Households with children under three could
also receive a micronutrient supplement.
The transfers went to mothers, who
were thought more responsible for caring
for children. The program imposed a
monthly ceiling of $75 per family. In 1999
the average monthly transfer was around
$24 per family, nearly 20 percent of mean
household consumption before the program. Transfers were also inﬂation-indexed
every six months (today the maximum is
$95 and the average is $35).
Highly centralized, the program has just
one intermediary between program ofﬁcials and beneﬁciaries—a woman community promoter chosen by a general assembly
of households in targeted communities. She
can also liaise between beneﬁciaries and
education and health providers.
By the end of 1999 the program covered
some 2.6 million rural families—about 40
percent of rural families and a ninth of all
families in Mexico. The program budget
was almost $780 million, or 0.2 percent of
gross domestic product and 20 percent of
the federal poverty alleviation budget.

Almost 60 percent of program transfers
went to households in the poorest 20 percent of the national income distribution and
more than 80 percent to the poorest 40 percent. This is impressive. The median targeting effectiveness in 77 safety net programs
from around the world was to have 65 percent of beneﬁts go to the poorest 40 percent
(according to one recent study).
Even with careful targeting and monitoring, the program’s administrative costs
were less than 9 percent of total costs—substantially lower than earlier poverty alleviation efforts in Mexico. Despite its initial
large scale, the program did not cover all
the poor, particularly in urban areas.

Boosting enrollments
Girls’ enrollment in middle school rose from
67 percent to around 75 percent, and boys’
from 73 percent to 78 percent. Most of the
increase came from increases in the transition from primary to middle school (ﬁgure
1). The program worked primarily by keeping children in school, not by encouraging
those who had dropped out to return. It also
helped reduce the incidence of child labor.

Labor force participation decreased by about
20 percent for boys. Still, a substantial number of children from poor families continue
to combine work with school.
The impacts on learning are less clear.
Teachers report improvements, attributing
them to better attendance, student interest,
and nutrition. But a study conducted one
year after the program started found no difference in test scores.

Improving nutrition and health
The program helped reduce the incidence
of low height for age among children one to
three years old. (Before the program stunting was very high, at 44 percent.) Annual
mean growth in height was 16 percent for
children covered by the program. On average, height increased by 1–4 percent, and
weight by 3.5 percent. These gains were
achieved despite evidence that some households did not regularly receive nutrition
supplements and that supplements were
often “shared” with older children. Part of
the effect can be attributed to spending
more on food and to consuming more
nutritious food, as recommended by the
nutrition information sessions. There were
also positive spillover effects for nonbeneﬁciaries in the same community.
The program substantially increased
preventive health care visits. Visits by pregnant women in their ﬁrst trimester rose 8
percent, keeping babies and mothers
healthier. Illnesses dropped 25 percent
among newborns and 20 percent among
children under ﬁve (ﬁgure 2). The prevalence of anemia in children two to four
years old declined 19 percent. Adult health
improved too.

Reducing poverty
The program is not only raising incomes
temporarily, it should help raise future productivity and earnings of the children beneﬁting. Modeling exercises ﬁnd that nutritional supplements alone would boost lifetime earnings by about 3 percent and edu-

cation impacts would increase them by 8
percent. A general equilibrium analysis of
Progresa found that the welfare impact was
60 percent higher than that of the highly
distortionary food subsidies that Mexico
used previously.

Evaluating impacts
Progresa was unusual in integrating evaluation from the beginning, enabling it to
assess impacts fairly precisely. To ensure
political credibility, the evaluation was contracted out to a foreign-based research
group, the International Food Policy
Research Institute.
Phasing in communities in a random
fashion—required for budgetary purposes—allowed the construction of 186 control and 320 treatment groups. Having the
control groups enabled evaluators to “wash
out” confounding factors, including time
trends and shocks (economic and climatic).
Eventually all control communities were
incorporated in the program. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations were conducted, the latter using semistructured
interviews, focus groups, and workshops.

31

The evaluation design captures the
many determinants of outcomes. But it has
limitations. Policymakers would beneﬁt
from knowing how the program could be
manipulated to improve impacts. For
example, what is the impact of conditioning the transfers rather than giving pure
unconditioned transfers? In addition,
households in the control group might have
been affected by the intervention or by
knowing that they might receive it in the
future, an effect that would muddy the
comparisons.
Evaluations can address these issues, but
the complexity (and expense) increases
substantially. Alternative approaches that
rely on modeling—imposing additional
assumptions on the analysis—might be
necessary. Such analyses are currently
underway.

Evidence makes the difference
A conditional cash transfer program can be
a powerful way of promoting education,
health, and nutritional outcomes on a
massive scale. The success of the Progresa
program has led to similar programs,
especially in other Latin American countries (Colombia, Honduras, Jamaica, and
Nicaragua).
Evaluation was not an afterthought. It
continually fed back into improving program operations. And its rigor increased
conﬁdence in the validity of assessments of
the program’s effects.
Evaluation was important for domestic
and international political and economic
support—and thus contributed to program sustainability. Unlike previous programs, this one was not abandoned after a
change in government. Clear and credible
evidence of large beneﬁts for the country’s
poor contributed to maintaining the
integrity of the program’s design (albeit
with a name change). It also made it easier
to get support from the Inter-American
Development Bank for a major expansion
of the program.

Governments should
make services work

2

chapter

The responsibility that governments take on
for basic health and education can be discharged in many ways—among them, fostering economic growth, increasing public
spending, and applying technical interventions. Each can contribute to better outcomes.
But if they are not supporting services that
work—services that result from effective institutional arrangements—they will not make a
large sustainable difference. Making services
work requires changing the institutional relationships among key actors. Subsequent chapters of this Report develop and apply a framework to understand how and why those
relationships play out for different services.
Economic growth, though a major
determinant of human development outcomes, would need to be substantially faster
than it has been in most countries to make
dramatic improvements through that channel alone. Public spending makes improvements possible, but the improvements will
fall short if spending fails to reach poor
people—either because it goes for things
the poor do not use or because it is diverted
along the way—or if services are not made
more productive. Applying technical interventions—combining inputs to produce
outputs and outcomes more effectively—is
also important. But simply adjusting inputs
without reforming the institutions that produce inefﬁciencies will not lead to sustainable improvements.

A public responsibility
Governments—and the societies they
represent—often see improving outcomes in
health and education as a public responsibility. They are supported in this by the international endorsement of the Millennium
Development Goals (see Overview). A variety
of reasons lie behind this responsibility: clas-

sic welfare economics arguments for government intervention, political economy reasons
for intervention in key social sectors, appeals
to fundamental human rights. Governments
demonstrate their responsibility by ﬁnancing, providing, or regulating the services that
contribute to health and education outcomes. The services come in many shapes
and sizes: building and stafﬁng schools, subsidizing hospitals, regulating water and electrical utility companies, building roads, providing cash transfers to individuals and
households. Making these services work
means that governments are meeting their
responsibility.

Public spending
This responsibility is often reﬂected in government spending. Health and education
alone account for about a third of aggregate
government spending, with the average
slightly lower in poorer countries and regions
(table 2.1). But there are wide variations
across countries, even within the same
region. Health and education spending
accounted for 13 percent of public spending
in Sierra Leone in 1998 but 34 percent in
Kenya—18 percent in Estonia in 1997 but 59
percent in Moldova in 1996. Social security
and welfare spending, much of it directed to
improving health and education, typically
makes up another 10–20 percent of aggregate
spending.108
Governments contribute a large share of
the ﬁnancing for schools and clinics. Wages
and salaries on average account for 75 percent of recurrent public spending on education—and often for almost all the spending
(96 percent in Kenya).109 Most teachers and
many health workers are civil service employees. Salaries aside, government subsidies can
make up a large share of a facility’s budget.

Governments should make services work

Public provision
In education, health, water, and electricity the
public sector is a major provider (if not a
monopoly) as well as a funder of services. The
Indonesian government operates more than
150,000 primary schools and 10,000 junior
secondary schools that cover 85 percent and
60 percent of the respective enrollments.110
The Ugandan government operated 1,400
primary level facilities and close to 100 hospitals in 1996.111 The Indian public sector runs
almost 200,000 primary health facilities and
15,000 secondary and tertiary facilities.112 But
wide public provision does not always translate into substantial use. In Uganda government health facilities handled just 40 percent
of treatments sought in facilities.113 In India,
even with the huge organization of public
health facilities, the private sector accounts for
80 percent of outpatient treatments and
almost 60 percent of inpatient treatments.114

Reasons for public responsibility

Economics gives two rationales for public
responsibility. First, because of market failures, the amount of services produced and
consumed would be less than optimal from
society’s standpoint without government
intervention. Market failures can be externalities. The fact that an immunized child
reduces the spread of disease in society is an
incentive to immunize more children. Basic
education might beneﬁt others besides the
graduate, another externality. Individuals
have little incentive to build and maintain the
roads that are crucial to promoting access to
services, but communities and societies do.
“Public goods” (goods that, once produced,
cannot be denied to anyone else and whose
consumption by one person does not diminish consumption by others) are an extreme
form of market failure. Mosquito control in a
malaria-endemic area is an example. There is
no market incentive to produce public goods,
so government intervention is required.
Other market failures relate to imperfect
information. Different information about
individuals’ risk of illness can lead to a breakdown in the market for health insurance.
Lack of knowledge about the beneﬁts of hand
washing or of education can lead to less than
desirable investment and consumption.115

These market failures call for government
intervention, but they do not necessarily call
for public provision: it could well be that the
proper role is ﬁnancing, regulation, or information dissemination.
The second economics justiﬁcation for
public responsibility is equity. Improving
health and education outcomes for poor people, or reducing the gaps in outcomes between
poor people and those who are better off, is
often considered a responsibility of government. There are a variety of social justice reasons behind this. Some see this responsibility
as rooted in the belief that basic education
and basic health are fundamental human
rights (box 2.1). The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts an
individual’s right to “a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself
and of his family, including food, clothing,
housing and medical care” and a right to education that is compulsory and “free, at least in
the elementary and fundamental stages.”116
Subsequent international accords have
expanded the set of health and education
rights.117 Many national constitutions have
guarantees for health and education.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

BOX 2.1

Most governments take responsibility for health and education—often appealing
to human rights

Debates on health care and education in developing countries often appeal to human rights.
Rooted in the broader context of social justice,
these rights are set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) as well as other
international conventions, such as the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights
(1966). Several international and bilateral agencies have endorsed a human rights orientation.
In addition, the constitutions and laws of many
countries include references to rights to education and health care (a review of constitutional
rights in 165 countries with written
constitutions found that 116 referenced a right
to education and 73 a right to health care; 95
stipulated free education and 29 free health
care for at least some services to some groups).
With education and health central to rights, the

practical implications of approaches based on
rights complement welfare economics.
An approach based on rights emphasizes
equality in dignity and equality of opportunity.
It highlights the need to look at outcomes for all
individuals and groups, especially the legally
and socially disadvantaged. It makes explicit a
consideration that economics incorporates with
difﬁculty: many psychological repercussions to
poverty result in poor people’s inability to avail
themselves of health care and education
services, even when such services are available.
Welfare economics provides tools for assessing priorities and possibilities for intervening
when budgets are limited —and offers a metric
for doing so. Several aspects of economic analysis provide instruments for implementing rights,
complementing a rights-based approach.

The notion of health and education as
basic human rights provides a strong basis for
public responsibility, but ambiguities remain.
Does a right to medical care imply that government must provide it or even ﬁnance it?
The human rights to “periodic holidays with
pay” or “equal work for equal pay,” as mentioned in the United Nations declaration, are
generally not interpreted to imply government subsidies.118 Although free elementary
education is asserted as a right, parents also
have a right “to choose the kind of education
that shall be given to their children”—suggesting that universal public provision is not
required.119 Social equity and fundamental
human rights suggest a responsibility for government but leave open the ways of discharging that responsibility. Importantly, enshrining these notions as rights legitimizes the
demands of citizens—especially poor citizens—that government take responsibility
for making services work.
Market failures and social justice are normative justiﬁcations for public responsibility—
they describe why governments should be
involved. They do not always give much guidance on how. Why governments actually get
involved provides insight on how public
responsibility is discharged. Education has long
been a battleground for beliefs, ideas, and values. The late 19th and early 20th centuries offer
many stories of this battle, from the movement
for secular primary education in France to a

More generally, the approaches overlap on
many of their practical policy consequences.
Both are skeptical that electoral politics and the
market provide enough accountability for effective and equitable provision of health and education services—so there is a need for government and community involvement. An
economics approach to making services work—
such as the one in this Report—is informed by
the guidance on participation and
empowerment that international human rights
instruments provide. In addition, rights reinforce
poor people’s claims on resources overall and
on those allocated for basic services in particular—key elements of the effective “voice” of
poor people discussed here.

public education system focused on nationalism after the Meiji restoration in Japan.120
Much of this involvement is high-minded:
a coherent public education system probably
contributes to social cohesion, particularly
important in fractionalized societies.121 Postcolonial states embraced public provision of
education as a strategy for nation building.
But public provision can also be the rational
manifestation of a state’s desire to inculcate a
particular set of beliefs. Tanzania’s 1967 education reforms were wrapped up with Ujama
and African Socialism. Indonesia’s mass education campaign was closely tied to nationbuilding and national ideology codiﬁed in
pancasila—principles whose teaching was
enforced in every school until the fall of the
New Order government.
Beyond nation building and social cohesion, services operate fully in the political
realm: free education and free health care are
electoral rallying cries in many countries,
popular with many voters. In 1997 Uganda’s
President Museveni campaigned on a platform of free universal primary education.
The message was extremely popular—he
won—and within a short time ofﬁcial enrollments nearly doubled (see spotlight).122
Uganda is not unique: many politicians identify themselves with their stance toward public provision of services. But success is hard:
few politicians have been able to transform
these political platforms into outcomes. Ser-

vices operate in the political realm in yet
another way. Many politicians use jobs in the
large bureaucracies associated with services
to reward supporters or to build power.

Given the responsibility to promote education
and health outcomes, what can governments
do? One approach is hands-off: rely solely on
economic growth since higher national
income is strongly associated with lower child
mortality and higher primary school completion (crate 1.1 and ﬁgure 2.1). Among lowincome countries, 10 percent more income
per capita is associated, on average, with a 6.6
percent lower child mortality rate and a 4.8
percent higher primary school completion
rate. Among middle-income countries 10 percent more income per capita is associated with
7.7 percent less mortality but little improvement in primary completion.
At low levels of income relatively small differences in per capita income can mean big differences in outcomes. Per capita income was
only about $90 higher in Madagascar than in
Malawi in the 1990s, but there were almost 50
fewer child deaths per 1,000 births in Madagascar in 2000.123 The association between income
and health and education outcomes works
both ways: more income leads to lower mortality and more children completing primary
school; better health and education can lead to
higher productivity and incomes. Studies have
tried to disentangle these relationships, and
they typically still ﬁnd income to be a robust
and strong determinant of outcomes.124
But income is not the whole story: at any
given income there are wide variations in
achievement. With average incomes of just
under $300 per capita in the 1990s, Vietnam
had a child mortality rate of about 40 per
1,000 in 2000 and Cambodia of 120. At per
capita incomes around $4,000 in the 1990s,
Malaysia had a child mortality rate of about
12 per 1,000 in 2000 and Brazil of just less
than 40. Similarly, Madagascar and Nigeria
both had per capita incomes close to $300 in
the 1990s, but by the end of the decade the
primary completion rate was 26 percent in
Madagascar and 67 percent in Nigeria.125

between 1990 and 2015 (one of the Millennium Development Goals) means reducing it
by 4.4 percent a year. Low-income countries
would need sustained per capita income
growth of 6.7 percent a year to reduce mortality by two-thirds by 2015. Senegal would
have to boost per capita income from about
$650 to $3,500—close to the level in Panama.
Brazil would need an increase from almost
$5,000 to $20,000—close to the per capita
income in New Zealand.126
Similarly, achieving universal primary
school completion through income alone
would require massive economic growth. In
Mauritania, where primary school completion was 46 percent in 1990, per capita income
growth would need to average 6.5 percent a
year. So while income and outcomes are
strongly associated, especially in low-income
countries, reaching the Millennium Development Goals will require dramatically high—
perhaps unrealistically high—growth rates if
growth is the only channel for achieving the
goals. Policies that do more than increase
growth are required.127

More public spending alone is
not enough
If growth is not enough, what else can governments do to improve outcomes? One
approach is to spend more. Increasing public

The Fast-Track Initiative—providing assistance for credible national education strategies

With more than 100 million children not in primary school, the “Fast-Track Initiative” (FTI) was
launched in June 2002 to accelerate progress
toward Education for All in low-income
countries. Under the FTI national education
plans are assessed against an indicative framework of policy benchmarks, prospects for scaling up, and allowances for ﬂexibility and learning by doing.To ensure that education goals are
embedded in an overall national strategy and
consistent with countries’ medium-term expenditure framework, a criterion for FTI eligibility is
a national commitment to a formal Poverty
Reduction Strategy.
The FTI supports countries in addressing key
policy, capacity, data, and ﬁnancing constraints
to universal primary completion by 2015, net
intake into ﬁrst grade of 100 percent of girls and
boys by 2010, and improved learning outcomes.
An initial group of 23 countries was invited to
join the initiative, and all accepted.
The FTI was inspired by the Monterrey Consensus—that better results accrue when development support is targeted to countries that
accept clear accountability for results and adopt
appropriate policy reforms.The FTI was
conceived as a process for countries with sound
education policies, embedded in an agreed-on
macroeconomic framework, to receive added
support from donors.

Clear impacts—and obstacles
Less than a year into the process the FTI has had
some clear positive impacts. First, it has demonstrated that the new framework of mutual
accountability is accepted by developing coun-

tries.With impressive speed countries have
ensured that their sector plans meet the new tests
for credibility and sustainability. And the donors
have increased resources for FTI countries,
seconded staff to an international secretariat for
the initiative (in the World Bank), and agreed on
FTI operating principles and guidelines.
More generally, the FTI has:
• Raised the political proﬁle of Education for
All, and increased awareness of the need for
faster progress to reach education goals.
• Sharpened developing countries’ focus on
primary school completion and quality (not
just coverage) and on the importance of getting policies right.
• Brought ﬁeld-based donors into a uniﬁed policy dialogue with governments, improving
coordination.
• Mobilized more resources for primary education (a 60 percent increase in ofﬁcial development assistance commitments to the ﬁrst FTI
countries).
But the experience with FTI has also highlighted some obstacles. At the country level
these include difﬁculties in ensuring that
resources reach the service delivery level; a need
to consider a variety of service delivery
modes—including community-run schools,
NGO-run schools, and faith-based schools—and
the complexities of public support to this range
of providers; the need to make difﬁcult reforms
to increase efﬁciency and ensure sustainability;
and the need for better data systems to support
“real-time” tracking of education results.

spending can be a critical part of promoting
improvements in health and education. For
example, it may be necessary to spend more
on interventions to reduce mortality or on
education reforms that underpin increases
in primary completion rates—and part of
this spending might require international
assistance (box 2.2). But the large variation
in the effectiveness of using funds makes it
hard to ﬁnd a consistent relationship
between changes in spending and outcomes—highlighting the importance of
spending money well.
Just how variable is the association
between public spending and outcomes? A
glimpse at a handful of countries provides an
indication.

Some problems for donors
Despite some progress donor procedures are
not yet harmonized, and much ﬁnancing
remains fragmented. Some donor assistance
under the FTI continues to be input-driven, subject to a “donor discount,” with resources
earmarked for contractors in donor countries
rather than providing ﬂexible support for core
expenditures.
Too much aid still ﬂows to historically
preferred countries, rather than good performers. Although the donors have mobilized additional funding for FTI countries case by case,
there remain some “donor orphans.”Without
pooled funding to support these countries, the
FTI will not be able to deliver on the donors’
commitment that “no country with a credible
plan for Education for All will be thwarted for
lack of external support.”The momentum of FTI
could easily be lost if a fundamental principle of
the compact—assistance supporting effective
policies—is not honored.
The FTI is a major part of international
responses—including the G8 process, the Monterrey Consensus, and the New Economic Partnership for African Development—to provide
momentum for universal primary completion by
2015, perhaps the most achievable of the Millennium Development Goals. Success will
require that developing countries pay attention
to policy reform and human and ﬁnancial
resources. It will also require that donors coordinate better and honor their side of the bargain
by assisting performing countries.

Malawi increased by $8 per child of primary school age.128 In Ethiopia primary
school completion stagnated, going from
22 percent in 1990 to 24 percent in 1999,
while in Malawi it rose from 30 percent
to 50 percent (ﬁgure 2.2).
Per capita public spending on health fell
between $1 and $5 in Côte d’Ivoire and
Haiti from the 1980s to the 1990s: child
mortality worsened substantially in Côte
d’Ivoire but improved in Haiti—though
remaining high (ﬁgure 2.3).
Thailand increased public spending on
primary schooling more than Peru did,
yet primary school completions fell in
Thailand and increased in Peru.
Public spending on health diverged in
Mexico and Jordan, yet reductions in
child mortality were similar.

income, public spending and outcomes are
only weakly associated (ﬁgure 2.4)—both
substantively (in the sense that the correlation is small) and statistically (in the sense
that the correlation is indistinguishable from
zero).133 With similar changes in spending
associated with different changes in outcomes, it should come as no surprise that the
cross-country association is so weak.

For each country there is a story about
why public spending contributed to improving outcomes or why it did not. That is the
crux: the effectiveness of public spending
varies tremendously.129 In-depth studies conﬁrm this variability—for example, an analysis
of Malaysia over the late 1980s found little
association between public spending on doctors and infant or maternal mortality.130 A
major improvement in the incidence of public education spending on poor people in
South Africa has been slow to translate into
better outcomes.131 But an impact evaluation
of the expansion of public school places in
Indonesia in the 1970s found a signiﬁcant
positive impact on school enrollments.132
Another way to look at the impact of public spending is in a cross-section of countries.
In general, countries that spend more public
resources on health have lower child mortality, and countries that spend more on education have higher completion rates. But this
association is driven largely by the fact that
public spending increases with national
income. After controlling for national

Deeper analysis of the relation between
public spending and child mortality ﬁnds
results varying from statistical signiﬁcance
to insigniﬁcance—for four main reasons.
First, some countries might spend more
because they need to spend more to remedy
urgent underlying health problems. The
resulting cross-sectional association would
be uninformative since more spending
would appear to be associated with worse
outcomes. Using statistical techniques that
exploit the variation in spending that
depends on factors unrelated to mortality

outcomes still produces an insigniﬁcant relationship.134 Those techniques are not universally accepted, however, and it is possible that
governments are adjusting what they spend in
response to underlying health conditions.
Second, spending may affect different
groups in society differently. Public spending
could affect child mortality among poor families without having a large overall impact.
Studies allowing for this effect have found a
stronger association between spending and
outcomes for poor people—but the result is
only weakly signiﬁcant and not robust.135
A third strand of the research on this issue
focuses on the composition of spending: does
more spending on primary rather than tertiary health activities have a different impact
on mortality? The cross-national statistical
evidence is weak.136 A fourth strand investigates factors that might modulate the effectiveness of public spending. It ﬁnds that corruption, governance, or urbanization might
play a role, but the results are inconsistent
from one analysis to another.137
Two methodological issues are important
for interpreting these analyses. First, the sample of countries in a study affects the results.
A sample of a few countries that have spent a
lot and achieved a lot—and a few countries
that have spent little and achieved little—will
yield a signiﬁcant association between more
spending and lower mortality. A different

sample might yield no association. The number of countries in studies that have
addressed this question varies dramatically—
from 22 to 116—so different results should
not be surprising.138
Second, the speciﬁcation in the analysis
can change the assessment of the result. For
example, controlling for adult literacy in
addition to income in the associations illustrated in ﬁgure 2.4 yields an association and a
signiﬁcance level that are even closer to zero.
The message from these studies is not that
public funding cannot be successful. It is that
commitment and appropriate policies,
backed by public spending, can achieve a lot.
Infant mortality was high in Thailand in 1970
at 74 per 1,000 births, and the use of community hospitals and health centers was low, in
part because quality was low. But the government’s commitment to reduce infant mortality was strong. Health planners took stock,
analyzing information on service use and
from household surveys. Thailand doubled
real per capita public spending on health
between the early 1970s and the mid-1980s.
But it also did more. It built facilities in
remote areas, directed more services to poor
areas and poor people, improved staff training, provided incentives for doctors to locate
in remote areas, and promoted community
involvement in managing health care delivery. The oversight of doctors was strengthened. And the authority for various programs
was devolved to the provincial level, freeing
the central Ministry of Public Health to concentrate on planning, coordination, and technical support. By 1985 infant mortality had
fallen to 42 per 1,000 births, and today it is 28
per 1,000.139 Similar stories are playing out 20
years later in other parts of the developing
world.

Public spending on services fails
to reach poor people
Most poor people do not get their fair share
of public spending on services, let alone the
larger share that might be justiﬁed on
equity grounds. Public expenditure incidence analysis—matching who uses publicly ﬁnanced services with how much governments spend per user—provides a
snapshot of who beneﬁts from government
spending. Results typically show that the

poorest ﬁfth of the populace receives less
than a ﬁfth of education or health expenditures, while the richest ﬁfth receives more.
In Ghana for example, the poorest ﬁfth
received only 12 percent of public expenditures on health in 1994, whereas the richest
ﬁfth received 33 percent (ﬁgure 2.5).
One reason for this imbalance is that
spending is skewed to services disproportionately used by richer people. Public
spending on primary education tends to
reach poor people. The poorest ﬁfth of

Armenians got almost 30 percent of the
beneﬁt of public spending on primary education in 1999. But not all spending on primary services is pro-poor. While public
spending on primary health care tends to be
more pro-poor than overall spending, it
does not always disproportionately reach
the poor. The poorest ﬁfth of the populace
in Côte d’Ivoire beneﬁted from only 14 percent of public spending on primary health
facilities in 1995 (compared with 11 percent
from all health spending).140

Orienting public spending toward services
used by poor people helps, but it does not
help unless the spending reaches the frontline,
where it beneﬁts poor people. A study in
Uganda found that in the early 1990s only 13
percent of government primary education
capitation grants made it to the intended destination, primary schools. The rest went to
purposes unrelated to education or to private
gain. Poor students suffered disproportionately, as schools catering to them received even
smaller shares of the grants (see spotlight).141
The story in health is the same. Drugs
intended for health clinics often never get
there. In the mid-1980s more than 70 percent
of the government’s supply of drugs disappeared in Guinea.142 Studies in Cameroon,
Tanzania, and Uganda estimated that 30 percent of publicly supplied drugs were misappropriated—in one case as much as 40 percent were “withdrawn for private use.”143

Public spending has trouble creating quality
services and reaching poor people. So why be
surprised that spending is only weakly associated with outcomes? But there is another reason for the weak association: private and
public sectors interact, and what matters is
the net impact on the use of services. Increasing public provision may simply crowd out,
in whole or in part, equally effective services
obtained from nongovernment providers.
This works through two channels. First,
individual demand in both public and private sectors will respond to a change in the
public sector. A review of the impact of price
increases in public health clinics in seven
countries found that a substantial percentage
of visits to public providers deterred by price
increases are redirected to private ones—
although the magnitude of the effect varies
across settings.144 Second, private providers
may respond to changes in public provision.
An experiment in increasing fees in public
facilities in Indonesia in the early 1990s
found that the number of private dispensaries and hospitals increased substantially,
and that this resulted in only small changes in
health outcomes.145
Unless resources support services that
work for poor people, they will be ineffective.
The efﬁcacy of spending is so varied that it is

hard to associate a cost with achieving any
target improvement in outcomes, as with the
Millennium Development Goals (box 2.3).

Technical adjustments
without changes in incentives
are not enough
If more public money is spent on services—
and more of that money is spent on services
used by poor people and makes it to the
intended school or clinic—how the money is
used still determines its efﬁcacy. Consider
recurrent spending on education in SubSaharan Africa. Of 18 populous Sub-Saharan
African countries with data, most spend substantially more than the recommended 66
percent on teachers (ﬁgure 2.6).146 And this
isn’t just a central government phenomenon.
In Nigeria wages account for about 90 percent of local government recurrent expenditures on primary education. No one would
deny that teachers are a key part of the
schooling process and that paying them adequately is important. But if there is no money
left to pay for other important inputs, such as
textbooks, learning will suffer.
Why does such a large share of education
spending go to teachers? Spending on teachers is the result of balancing technical issues
with political jockeying by parents, teachers,
the rest of the civil service, and advocates of
spending priorities outside of the education
sector. Spending on other inputs often loses
out to spending on teachers—who are often
vocal, organized, connected, and contractually obligated to be paid. It happens where
spending is fairly high—Kenya spends more
than 6 percent of GDP on education—and
fairly low—Tanzania spends less than 2 percent of GDP on education. The purpose is
not to single out Sub-Saharan Africa—the
phenomenon is widespread—or to pick on
teachers. It is to suggest that ﬁxing the problem requires dealing not just with technical
or managerial questions of how much to
spend on one input relative to others, but
with the institutional and political contexts
that generate these decisions in the ﬁrst place.
Identifying what contributes to an effective classroom or appropriate medical treatment is important for decisionmaking. In
well-functioning systems service provision

BOX 2.3

Why it’s so hard to “cost” the Millennium Development Goals

How much will it cost to reach the Millennium
Development Goals? That question, crucial for governments and donors who have committed to the
goals, is extremely difﬁcult to answer.
What cost? For universal primary education
completion, does “costing” mean putting a price tag
on enrolling all primary-age children in public
schools? With more than 100 million children of primary school age not in school, multiplying the number in each country by average public spending per
primary student yields a total “cost” of about $10 billion. But this number overlooks a simple point: children not in school might be harder to induce to
come to school, so the marginal cost of enrolling a
child could be higher than the average cost.These
children might have higher opportunity costs, so it
might require a larger subsidy to get them into
school. Or they might live in remote areas, where it
would cost more to build schools or to compensate
them for traveling to more central locations. In addition, this approach implicitly assumes that spending
on a particular target can be earmarked separately
from other spending in the sector.Though that is
possible, it is not easy.
Efﬁciency gains. The average cost calculation
also ignores the weak overall association between
spending and outcomes. Additional spending will be
associated with only small increases in outcomes if
the additional funds are spent with the average
observed efﬁciency (ﬁgure 2.4).That means it will
take astronomically high amounts to achieve the
goals. But what if the money is “well spent”?
A country-by-country simulation of spending in
47 low-income countries adjusted the proximate
determinants of primary completion success—public spending as a share of GDP, the share of spending
that goes to teachers, the level of teacher salaries,
pupil-teacher ratio, average repetition rate. It found
that average external resources of about $2.8 billion
a year would be needed. (Since the simulation
included domestically mobilized resources as a policy lever, the model yields the amount of external
resources required).147 The average-cost approach to
enrolling out-of-school children in these 47
countries yields a total incremental cost of $3.1 billion a year.148
“Costing” a change in proximate determinants is
useful for identifying the ﬁscal implications of a
change in policy, but it says little about the success

can be improved through better teaching
materials, more reliable availability of drugs,
better training of health workers—that is,
through technical improvements in the proximate determinants of successful service provision. And management reforms may
reduce the frequency of shirking teachers or

or failure of turning that spending into outcomes.
This does not mean “if this amount of money were
spent, the Millennium Development Goals will be
met.” It means “if the goals are met, here is what it
will have cost.”
Financing transitional costs. If institutional
reforms are necessary for sustainable improvements
in outcomes, the costs of those reforms should be
counted: for example, the cost of repurposing physical infrastructure or compensating redundant staff.
These costs are determined by country conditions.
For example, the cost of a severance package will
depend on a country’s labor market, civil service regulations and norms, and other local factors. Given
the uncertainty surrounding costs, it makes little
sense to estimate transitional costs on a global basis.
Interdependence and double counting.
Progress on each Millennium Development Goal
feeds back into the others. Safe water and good sanitation contribute to better health. Good health
enhances the productivity of schooling. Education
promotes better health. Interventions that promote
one goal promote all of them. If the cost of reaching
each goal is assessed independently, and the results
are totaled across goals, there is double counting.149
Multiple determinants. But the goals do not
just depend on each other—their determinants are
multiple, cutting across many sectors. Little is known
about the relative contribution of each factor to outcomes or about the magnitude of potential interaction effects (see crate 1.1 in chapter 1). For example,
the impact of sanitation on mortality depends on
access to safe water.The effectiveness of vaccines,
and thus their contribution to lowering mortality,
depend on preserving the “cold chain,” which
depends on roads, other transport, and energy infrastructure. Precise estimates of these independent
and interactive effects are not easy to come by.
In sum, costing the goals requires an estimate
that distinguishes between marginal and average
cost, incorporates the policy and institutional
changes required to make this additional expenditure effective, does not double- or triple-count given
the interdependence of the goals, and takes into
account the multiple determinants of each goal. No
wonder that coming up with costs of reaching the
goals is so difﬁcult.

incompetent doctors or corrupt police. But
trying to make services work in weak systems
by an effective and least-cost solution—
applying a codiﬁed set of actions or simply
training providers—will end in frustration if
politicians do not listen to citizens or if
providers have no incentive to perform well.

To understand why, it is important to distinguish between institutional and managerial reforms. Reducing teacher absenteeism
from 9 percent to 7 percent is a management
issue; reducing teacher absenteeism from 50
percent to 9 percent is an institutional issue.
Improving diagnostic recognition of speciﬁc
diseases is a management issue. Reducing
widespread mistreatment of routine conditions is an institutional issue.
Institutional reforms seek to strengthen
the relationships of accountability among
various actors so that good service provision
outputs emerge—with all their proximate
determinants, including active management.
Institutional arrangements need to take
advantage of the strengths of the market—
with its strong customer responsiveness,
organizational autonomy, and systemic pressures for efﬁciency and innovation. And the
strengths of the public sector—with its
ability to address equity and market failures
and its power to enforce standards. This is
not about reducing or avoiding key public
responsibilities. It is about creating new
ways to meet public responsibilities more
effectively. This might include alternatives
to public production, but it could just as
easily include institutional changes to make
public agencies perform better.

Understanding what works and
why—to improve services
To produce better health, better skills, and
better standards of living, service beneﬁciaries, providers, and the state must work
together. How? Understanding what works,
why, in what context—and how to spread
successful approaches—is the subject of
this Report. Many successful institutional
innovations worldwide show clearly that
services need not fail. They offer lessons to
guide replication and to scale up solutions.
A variety of stories illustrate the potential—
and the challenge.
Citizen report cards in Bangalore, India.
In the early 1990s public services in Karnataka’s capital city were in bad shape. A
technology boom unleashed rapid growth.
Services were of low quality and corruption
was rampant, affecting all income groups.
To monitor the government’s failure to

address these problems, and to motivate
change, a civil society group introduced
report cards in 1994 rating user experiences
with public services. The results—revealing
poor quality, petty corruption, lack of
access for slum dwellers, and the hidden
costs of outwardly cheap services—were
widely publicized by an active press.
The report cards gradually opened a dialogue between providers and user groups—
and eventually got a positive response from
the managers of public agencies. The state’s
chief minister set up a task force to improve
city governance. Follow-up activities—such
as an in-depth report card for hospitals—
delved deeper into problems with individual services. In 1999 a report card rated
some services substantially higher, though
scores on corruption and access to grievance systems remained low. The initiative
was so successful that the Public Affairs
Centre (which conducted the survey) collaborated with local partners to prepare
similar studies in other Indian cities.150 And
other countries (the Philippines, Ukraine,
and Vietnam) are adopting the approach.
Participatory budget formulation in Porto
Alegre, Brazil. The city of Porto Alegre,
with a population of more than a million,
developed an innovative model of budget
formulation. Citizen associations propose
projects, which are then publicly debated.
The proposals are combined with technical
assessments, and the procedure is repeated
to determine ﬁnal budget allocations. The
city made substantial strides. Access to
water went from 80 percent in 1989 to near
universal in 1996, and access to sewerage,
from less than 50 percent to 85 percent.
School enrollments doubled. And with
greater citizen willingness to pay for better
services, city revenue increased by 50 percent. To make the process pro-poor, the
poorest people had more voting power than
others. The approach has proved a resounding success for the inhabitants (and for the
political party, which repeatedly won elections). Several other cities have since
adopted similar procedures.151
Different stories point to other innovations: greater transparency of school fund-

ing in Uganda, citywide reform in Johannesburg, South Africa, cash transfers to
households in Mexico, statewide reform of
health services in Ceará, Brazil (see spotlights). Only one of these innovations was
evaluated using an experimental design
(Mexico’s Progresa). And not all have clear
measures of change in outputs or outcomes. But all hint at ways forward.
The various stories raise questions. Why
were the innovations implemented? Whom
did they affect? What made them work—

and what makes some other innovations
fail? Can they be replicated? To examine
these questions systematically—that is, to
learn from such examples—the Report
develops a framework that incorporates the
main actors—service beneﬁciaries, the
state, and providers—and describes how
each is linked by relationships of accountability (chapters 3 to 6). It then applies
these principles to speciﬁc reform agendas,
exploring how those relationships play out
in different sectors (chapters 7 to 11).

spotlight on

Kerala and Uttar Pradesh

One nation, worlds apart
States in one federal nation—following the same constitution, laws, and intergovernmental ﬁnance system, and subject to
the same election cycles—Kerala and Uttar Pradesh remain worlds apart in human development. Their different worlds
mean dramatic differences in the quality of life for millions—Uttar Pradesh, with 175 million people, is larger than all
but six countries in the world (Kerala has 32 million people).152 This is a story of achievement and failure, the power of
public action, and the burden of ofﬁcial inertia.

W

omen born in Kerala can expect
to live 20 years longer on average
than women born in Uttar
Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh’s infant mortality rate
is ﬁve times higher than Kerala’s (table 1). At
the start of this century, one in three girls in
Uttar Pradesh had never been to school: Kerala has universal enrollment. Kerala’s total
fertility rate is 1.96 births per woman (lower
than 2.1 in the United States and just above
1.7 in high-income European countries);
Uttar Pradesh’s fertility rate is 3.99 (substantially higher than the average of 2.85 for India
and 3.1 for low-income countries).
Education and health services in the two
states echo these differences. Studies suggest that public facilities in Kerala are likely

to be well supplied, adequately maintained,
and regularly staffed by teachers or physicians. Not so in Uttar Pradesh.153 A primary
health center in Kerala left unstaffed for a
few days may lead to public protests at the
nearest district ofﬁce.154 But a rural school
in Uttar Pradesh can be nonfunctional for
years and produce no civic protest.155
Women’s participation differs widely in the
two states: more than 70 percent of primary
school teachers in Kerala are women, only
25 percent in Uttar Pradesh.156

Why did Kerala succeed where
Uttar Pradesh failed?
History helped. Even though its consumption-related poverty was among the highest

in India, Kerala already led in human development in 1956 when it was reconstituted
as a new Indian state. Longstanding social
movements against caste divisions, its culture (including matrilineal inheritance in
certain communities), and openness to foreign inﬂuences (including missionary-led
education) all helped.
But history is not all. Much of Kerala’s
spectacular achievements came after the
mid-1950s. Adult literacy has risen from
around 50 percent in 1950 to more than 90
percent now and life expectancy at birth
from 44 years to 74. The birth rate has fallen
from 32 to 18. In 1956 the Malabar region of
Kerala lagged substantially behind the two
“native” states (Travancore and Cochin)
with which it was combined to form the
new Kerala state. Today, the differences have
disappeared.

Public action—and neglect
Dreze and Sen (2002) suggest that Kerala’s
success is the result of public action that
promoted extensive social opportunities
and the widespread, equitable provision of
schooling, health, and other basic services.
They argue that Uttar Pradesh’s failures can
be attributed to the public neglect of the
same opportunities.

•

The early promotion of primary education and female literacy in Kerala was
very important for social achievements
later on. In Uttar Pradesh educational
backwardness has imposed high penalties, including delayed demographic
transition and burgeoning population
growth.

•

Gender equity and the agency of women
appear to play a major role in Kerala’s
success. Uttar Pradesh has a long, welldocumented tradition of oppressive
gender relations and extraordinarily
sharp gender inequalities in literacy and
in women’s participation.157

food distribution, and social security
differ sharply in scope, access, quality,
and equitable incidence. In Uttar
Pradesh these services appear to have
been widely neglected and there has
been no particular effort to ensure
results, particularly in schools.

•

A more literate and better informed
public in Kerala was active in politics
and public affairs in a way that did not
appear to have happened in Uttar
Pradesh.

•

Informed citizen action and political
activism in Kerala—building partly on
mass literacy and the emphasis placed
on universal services by early communist and subsequent coalition governments—seem to have been crucial in
organizing poor people. In Uttar
Pradesh traditional caste and power
divisions, particularly in rural areas,
have persisted through more than 50
years of electoral politics—and such
divisions have come to form the core
of political discourse and clientelist
politics.

Political incentives matter for service
delivery and actual development outcomes.158 Delivering broad, universal basic
services has remained a credible political
platform in Kerala in contrast to the clientelist, caste, and class-driven politics of Uttar
Pradesh.
In Kerala, early governments with economic platforms emphasizing the provision of universal basic services established
a political agenda that remained important
in the coalition politics that followed.
Political competition conditioned on
promises to deliver better basic services
showed up in early budget allocations (ﬁgure 1): education and health services
accounted for a much higher share of public expenditures as compared to what was
spent on state administration.

By contrast, in Uttar Pradesh caste and
class-based divisions, and the absence of
compelling political alternatives to transcend these divisions, led to poor political
incentives for effective provision of universal, basic services. Political competition
revolved around access to instruments of
the state to deliver patronage and public
employment to speciﬁc clients. Public
expenditures in the early years were accordingly concentrated in state administration
and remained well above expenditures on
health and education. More recently, political parties have tended to underplay the
program or policy content of their platforms, and instead have publicized the ethnic proﬁle of their candidate lists to
demonstrate commitment to proportional
representation of ethnic groups in the
bureaucratic institutions of the state.159

Breaking out of vicious cycles
Public action can build on history, break
from it, or perpetuate it. Individuals’ abilities to press their demands depend on their
information, perceived rights, and literacy.
Public action—by inﬂuencing information
that citizens have, their legal protections,
and their schooling—inﬂuences private

action, especially by the politically weak.
And private action loops back to inﬂuence
public action. One set of reforms can lead
to further institutional evolution. A society
can be caught in a vicious cycle, as in Uttar
Pradesh, or be propelled by a virtuous one,
as in Kerala. As Dreze and Gazdar note: “In
Uttar Pradesh, the social failures of the state
are quite daunting, but the potential
rewards of action are correspondingly high,
and the costs of continued inertia even
higher.”160
As for Kerala, despite the many economic problems that linger and the new
ones that have appeared, the remarkable
rescript issued in 1817 by Gowri Parvathi
Bai, the 15-year-old queen of the erstwhile
state of Tranvancore, certainly seems to
have come true in its bold aspirations for
the human development of her subjects.
The rescript read:
“The state should defray the entire cost
of the education of its people in order that
there might be no backwardness in the
spread of enlightenment among them, that
by diffusion of education they might
become better subjects and public servants
and that the reputation of the state might
be enhanced thereby.”161

The framework
for service provision

3

chapter

The public sector has generally taken on
responsibility for the delivery of services
and frequently used civil service bureaucracies as the instrument. This approach has
had dramatic successes and—as chapter 1
documented—far too many failures. Much
remains to be done. Particularly for poor
people, there are widespread challenges in
providing affordable access, ﬁxing dysfunctional facilities, improving technical quality,
increasing client responsiveness, and raising
productivity. As chapter 2 noted, neither
economic growth, nor simply increasing
public spending, nor coming up with technocratic solutions is enough to meet this
challenge.
The failures in service provision have
not gone unnoticed. Indeed, there is a
cacophony of proposed institutional solutions: civil service reform, privatization,
democratization, decentralization, contracting out, provision through NGOs,
empowerment, participatory methods,
social funds, community-driven development, user associations. With each of
these solutions comes a bewildering variety of techniques and instruments:
demand-side transfers, participatory rural
appraisals, facility surveys, service score
cards, participatory budgets. None is a
panacea.
“One size does not ﬁt all” is a truism but
not very helpful. Everyone wanting to
improve services for poor people—from
the poor themselves to reform-minded
professionals, advocates, political leaders,
and external agencies—asks: What size ﬁts
me? Given the capabilities, resources, politics, and incentives that I face, what can be
done? What are the actions that would
improve services for poor people in my
circumstances? To evaluate alternative

arrangements for the provision of services
requires an encompassing framework—to
analyze which of the many items on the
menu of service reform is right for the
time, place, and circumstance.
This Report’s framework starts from the
speciﬁc and works to the general. Start with
a child in a classroom, a pregnant woman
at a clinic, someone turning a tap for water.
Each is seeking a service, and the proximate
determinants of success are clear. For any
individual service transaction to be successful, there needs to be a frontline
provider who is capable, who has access to
adequate resources and inputs, and who is
motivated to pursue an achievable goal.
The general question: what institutional
conditions support the emergence of capable, motivated frontline providers with
clear objectives and adequate resources?
The answer: successful services for poor
people emerge from institutional relationships in which the actors are accountable to
each other. (Please be patient, the rest of
the Report works out exactly what that sentence means.)
This chapter does ﬁve things. It introduces the analytical framework of actors
(individuals, organizations, governments,
businesses) and relationships of accountability that will be used throughout the
Report. It describes the characteristics of
services that make creating those relationships so crucial—and so difﬁcult. It uses the
framework and the characteristics of the
services to analyze why pure public sector
production often fails—and why pure privatization is not the answer. It lays out how
the various items on the agenda for service
reform are related and how the Report will
address them. And it addresses the dynamics of reform.

The framework for service provision

An analytical framework:
actors and accountabilities
Language evolves through common usage,
so no one is accountable when the word
accountability acquires so many different
uses and meanings. What this Report means
by accountability is a relationship among
actors that has ﬁve features: delegation,
ﬁnance, performance, information about performance, and enforceability (ﬁgure 3.1).
Relationships of accountability can be as
simple as buying a sandwich or taking a
job—and as complex as running a municipal democracy.

•

•

•

In buying a sandwich you ask for it (delegation) and pay for it (ﬁnance). The
sandwich is made for you (performance).
You eat the sandwich (which generates
relevant information about its quality).
And you then choose to buy or not buy a
sandwich another day (enforceability),
affecting the proﬁts of the seller.
In a typical employment relationship a
person is given a set of tasks (delegation)
and paid a wage (ﬁnance). The employee
works (performance). The contribution of
the employee is assessed (information).
And based on that information, the
employer acts to reinforce good or discourage bad performance (enforceability).
In a city the citizens choose an executive
to manage the tasks of the municipality
(delegation), including tax and budget
decisions (ﬁnance). The executive acts,
often in ways that involve the executive
in relationships of accountability with
others (performance). Voters then assess
the executive’s performance based on
their experience and information. And
they act to control the executive—either
politically or legally (enforceability).

There are many other vocabularies for
referring to these pervasive and critical
issues from a variety of disciplines (economics, political science, sociology) and
practices (public administration, management). This Report makes no claims of
coming up with a superior set of words. The
terms here have the virtues of completeness
(a name for everything the Report dis-

cusses) and consistency (the same names
are used throughout). See box 3.1 for a glossary of terms used in this Report. For
instance, recent work on the empowerment
of poor people, extending the work of the
2000/2001 World Development Report on
poverty, suggests four elements that overlap
in important ways with the analysis here:
access to information, inclusion and participation, accountability, and local organizational capacity.162 Others use the term
accountability to refer only to the dimension
of “answerability” (getting information
about performance) or to “enforceability.”
This Report uses the term broadly.
There are two motivations for this
broader approach. First, weaknesses in any
aspect of accountability can cause failure.
One cannot strengthen enforceability—
holding providers responsible for outputs
and outcomes—in isolation. If providers
do not receive clear delegation, precisely
specifying the desired objectives, increasing enforceability is unfair and ineffective.
If providers are not given adequate
resources, holding them accountable for
poor outcomes is again unfair and ineffective. Second, putting ﬁnance as the ﬁrst
step in creating a relationship of accountability stresses that simply caring about an
outcome controlled by another does not
create a relationship of accountability. To
be a “stakeholder” you need to put up a
stake.
In the chain of service delivery the Report
distinguishes four broad roles:

BOX 3.1

A glossary for this Report

Language is elastic—an asset reﬂecting the
diversity of human experience, but a liability
when such overused terms as accountability
lose their meaning.This Report, in developing its
service delivery framework, gives some
commonly used terms (such as accountability)
speciﬁc meaning and we coin a few new terms.
We do not claim we have superior or better
meanings, but we do try for internal consistency.
Accountability is a set of relationships
among service delivery actors with ﬁve features:

•

Delegating: Explicit or implicit understanding that a service (or goods embodying the service) will be supplied.

• Financing. Providing the resources to enable
the service to be provided or paying for it.
• Performing. Supplying the actual service.
• Having information about performance.

Obtaining relevant information and evaluating
performance against expectations and formal or
informal norms.

•

Enforcing. Being able to impose sanctions for
inappropriate performance or provide rewards
when performance is appropriate.
This Report deﬁnes four relationships of
accountability: client power (over providers), compacts, management (by provider organizations of
frontline professionals), and voice and politics
(between citizens and politicians/policymakers).
Actors: Individuals, households, communities, ﬁrms, governments, and other public, nongovernmental, and private organizations that
ﬁnance, produce, regulate, deliver, or consume
services. In economic theory the actors who
hold others accountable are sometimes called
principals, and the actors who are held accountable are called agents.
Client power: The relationship of accountability connecting clients to the frontline service
providers, usually at the point of service delivery, based on transactions through which clients
express their demand for services and can monitor supply and providers.
Clients/citizens: Service users who as citizens participate individually or in groups (e.g.,
labor unions) in political processes to shape and
attain collective goals. As clients, individuals
receive services to satisfy their household
demand. All clients are citizens (in most settings)
but, depending on the service, not all citizens
are clients.
Clientelism: The tendency of politicians as
patrons to respond to political competition by
excessively favoring one group of clients over
another in return for political advantage (vote
banks). Providing narrow supporter groups with
free public services or public employment, particularly where shirking is not sanctioned, is
often the way politicians practice clientelism.

Compacts: The broad, long-term relationship
of accountability connecting policymakers to
organizational providers.This is usually not as speciﬁc or legally enforceable as a contract. But an
explicit, veriﬁable contract can be one form of a
compact.

tions for public and private service providers to
operate. Usually accountability subrelationships
between politicians and policymakers (parodied
in the TV serial “Yes Minister”) are derived from
the constitution, administrative law, or rules of
public administration.

Discretionary services: Locally produced
services, such as classroom instruction or curative care, where the teacher or doctor must exercise signiﬁcant judgment on what to deliver and
how, and where clients typically have a large
information deﬁcit relative to the provider. Discretionary services that are transaction-intensive
are hard to monitor, both for the client and for
the policymaker, whether publicly or privately
provided.They pose particular challenges for all
the relationships of accountability.

Service delivery framework (or chain): The
four service-related actors—citizens/clients,
politicians/policymakers, organizational
providers, frontline professionals—and the four
relationships of accountability that connect
them:

Frontline professionals: The teachers, nurses,
doctors, engineers, clerks, or other providers who
come in direct contact with the client.
Long and short routes of accountability:
Clients may seek to hold service providers
accountable for performance in two ways. Client
power connecting clients and providers is the
direct,“short” route of accountability. When such
client power is weak or not possible to use,
clients must use voice and politics in their role
as citizens to hold politicians accountable—and
politician/policymakers must in turn use the
compact to do the same with providers.The
combination of the two is the roundabout,
“long” route of accountability.
Management: The relationship of accountability connecting organizational providers
and frontline professionals, comprising internal
processes for public and private organizations
to select, train, motivate, administer, and evaluate frontline professionals. These processes
may be rule-bound in large bureaucracies, or
idiosyncratic and ad hoc in small, private
providers.
Organizational providers: Public, private
nonproﬁt, and private for-proﬁt entities that
actually provide services.These may range from
government line ministries with hundreds of
thousands of employees to a private hospital
chain or from a vast urban water utility to a single, community-run, village school.
Politicians/policymakers: The service delivery actors authorized by the state to discharge
its legislative, regulatory, and rule-making
responsibilities. Politicians may be elected or
achieve their positions through nondemocratic
means.They can also be policymakers (the general who is president but also runs the military,
the telecom minister who administers the sale
of frequencies). But more commonly policymakers are the highest nonelected ofﬁcials—either
from a civil service or appointed. Politicians set
general directions. Policymakers implement
these directions and set and enforce the condi-

• Voice and politics: connecting citizens and
politicians.
• Compacts: connecting politicians/policymakers and providers.
• Management: connecting provider organizations with frontline professionals.
• Client power: connecting clients with
providers.
• Short route of accountability: See long and
short routes of accountability.

Strategic incrementalism: Pragmatic incremental reforms in weak institutional
environments that are not likely to fully address
service delivery problems but can alleviate acute
service problems while at the same time creating the conditions for deeper and more
favorable change—say, building capacity that
can respond to service delivery challenges.This
can be contrasted with, for lack of a better term,
“incremental incrementalism” that merely solves
one set of immediate problems but creates others. For example, working around existing government and governance structures with no
strategy for how these temporary measures will
affect the long term.
Transaction-intensive services: Services that
require repeated, frequent client-provider contact.
Transaction-intensive services may be
discretionary and require constant, minute decisions (classroom teaching), making them very hard
to monitor.Or the technology may not require
much discretion (ﬁre and forget) once there is
client contact (immunization).
Voice and politics: The most complex relationship of accountability. It connects citizens
and politicians and comprises many formal and
informal processes, including voting and electoral politics, lobbying and propaganda, patronage and clientelism, media activities, access to
information, and so on. Citizens delegate to
politicians the functions of serving their interests and ﬁnancing governments through their
taxes. Politicians perform by providing services,
such as law and order or communities relatively
free of pathogens. Citizens enforce accountability through elections and other less deﬁnitive
means, such as advocacy, legal actions, and
naming and shaming campaigns.

Citizens and clients. Individuals and
households have dual roles, as citizens and
as direct clients. As citizens they participate
both as individuals and through coalitions
(communities, political parties, labor
unions, business associations) in political
processes that deﬁne collective objectives;
they also strive to control and direct public
action in accomplishing those objectives. As
direct clients of service providers, individuals and households hope to get clean water,
have their children educated, and protect
the health of their family.
The role of citizens and clients as service
beneﬁciaries does not imply that all citizens
are alike or have the same views. Terms such
as civil society and community are sometimes used too casually. People differ in
beliefs, hopes, values, identities, and capabilities. Civil society is often not civil at all;
many “communities” have little in common. Individuals and households may disagree about collective objectives and work
to promote their own views, both individually and through associations, sometimes at
the direct expense of others. The capability
for collective action of citizens, a key element of service delivery, varies widely
across societies.

Politicians and policymakers. What distinguishes the sovereign state from all other
institutions is its monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within its boundaries. From this monopoly, politicians
derive the power to regulate, to legislate, to
tax—to set and enforce the “rules of the
game.” Politicians are deﬁned here as those
who control this power and discharge the
fundamental responsibilities of the state.
This does not mean that electoral politics
are always in play: some politicians are
heads of one-party states, some have
imposed their control through military
force, some arrive by election. In some systems executive politicians are dominant—
in others, legislative politicians.
The other actors who exercise the power
of the state are policymakers. In some countries politicians are also policymakers. But
in others there is a clear distinction between
the highest nonelected ofﬁcials of government—civil servants or appointees—and
political actors. Politicians set general directions, but policymakers set the fundamental
rules of the game for service providers to
operate—by regulating entry, enforcing
standards, and determining the conditions
under which providers receive public funds.

with organizational providers. Organizations manage frontline providers. And
clients exercise client power through interactions with frontline providers (ﬁgure
3.2). In low-income countries a ﬁfth role,
played by external ﬁnance agencies, affects
each of these relationships (chapter 11).
Weaknesses in any of the relationships—
or in the capacity of the actors—can result
in service failures. Providers can be made
directly accountable to clients (as in market
transactions) by passing decisions and powers directly to citizens or communities—a
“short route” of accountability. But, more
typically, the public sector is involved, so
two key relationships—voice and compacts—make up the main control mechanism of the citizen in a “long route” of
accountability. In either case, organizations
(such as health, education, and water
departments) need to be able to manage
frontline providers.

nonproﬁt (religious schools), or a for-proﬁt
(private hospital). It can be large (public
sector ministries with tens of thousands of
teachers) or small (a single community-run
primary school). There can be several types
of providers (public, nonproﬁt, and forproﬁt hospitals) and several providers of
each type delivering the same service in the
same area (many independently operated
nonproﬁt and for-proﬁt private hospitals).
When the organizational provider is in
the public sector, one needs to be clear
about the analytical distinction between the
policymaker and the head of the provider
organization. The policymaker sets and
enforces the rules of the game for all
providers—including the organizational
provider. The head of the provider organization makes internal “policies” speciﬁc to
the organization. Clear conceptually, the
distinction is not always clear in practice,
especially when the same individual plays
both roles. For example, a minister of public works may be the policymaker responsible for making and enforcing the rules for
all providers—but also the head of the
largest organizational provider of water services, directly responsible for management.
Unbundling these roles to create a clear
delineation of policymaking and direct production responsibilities is one element in
having clear lines of accountability.

Frontline providers. In the end, nearly all
services require a provider who comes in
direct contact with clients—teachers, doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, engineers, and so on.

The four relationships
of accountability
Of politicians to citizens: voice and politics.
This Report uses the term voice to express
the complex relationships of accountability
between citizens and politicians. Voice is
about politics, but it covers much more.
The voice relationship includes formal
political mechanisms (political parties and
elections) and informal ones (advocacy
groups and public information campaigns).
Delegation and ﬁnance between citizen and
state are the decisions about pursuing collective objectives and mobilizing of public
resources to meet those objectives. Citizens
need information about how actions of the
state have promoted their well-being. They
also need some mechanism for enforceability, to make sure that politicians and policymakers are rewarded for good actions and
penalized for bad ones. If politicians have
abused their position, or even just not pursued objectives aggressively and effectively,
citizens need a variety of mechanisms—not
just periodic elections—to make politicians
and policymakers accountable.

The framework for service provision

Of the organizational provider to the state:
compacts. The relationships between policymakers and service providers can be
thought of as compacts. The compact is not
always as speciﬁc and legally enforceable as
a contract, though a contract can be one
form of a compact. Instead, it is a broad
agreement about a long-term relationship.
The policymaker provides resources and
delegates powers and responsibility for collective objectives to the service providers.
The policymaker generates information
about the performance of organizations.
Enforceability comes into play when the
compact also speciﬁes the rewards (and
possibly the penalties) that depend on the
service provider’s actions and outputs. The
line between “the state” and “public sector
organizational provider” is not always easy
to draw.
Of the frontline professionals to the organizational provider: management. In every
organization, formal and informal tools of
management provide frontline workers
with assignments and delineated areas of
responsibility, equipping them with the
resources to act. In public agencies this
management function is at times blurred
because providers are employees of “the
government.” But all the standard management issues of selecting, training, and motivating workers in an organization apply to
all organizations—private, NGO, government, whatever. All service provision organizations—whether a government ministry, a religious body, a nonproﬁt NGO, or
a for-proﬁt ﬁrm—have to create a relationship of accountability with their frontline
providers.
Of the provider to the citizen-client: client
power. Because the policymaker cannot
specify all actions of providers in the compact, citizens must reveal to providers their
demand for services and monitor the
providers’ provision of services. Clients and
organizational providers interact through
the individuals who provide services—
teachers, doctors, engineers, repairmen—
the frontline professionals and frontline
workers.

BOX 3.2

The many meanings of accountability

Accountability is more a rubric than a single
item, but it is a fruitful rubric for making
useful distinctions.
Political accountability is the willingness
of politicians and policymakers to justify their
actions and to accept electoral, legal, or
administrative penalties if their justiﬁcation is
found lacking. Even within “political”accountability one can have distinctions.With vertical
political accountability, citizens individually or
collectively hold the state to account—say,
through voting or advocacy. Democracies
must have some vertical accountability.With
horizontal political accountability, agents of
the state formally hold another agent of the
state accountable—say, through the
“compact”relationship between policymakers and providers.
Authoritarian states may manifest considerable horizontal accountability (“the

trains run on time”), but not offer any vertical accountability. But where the relationship between clients and providers is very
strong (in some instances perhaps because
of the omnipresence of the ruling party, as
in Cuba), service delivery may work very
well without much vertical accountability.
Even for a given type of accountability
there are distinctions. Formal horizontal
political accountability is the formal
description of institutions, and authority
among agents of the state. It may differ
sharply from informal horizontal political
accountability, from the actual working of
institutions and effective control over decisions in state organizations.

Sources: Goetz and Jenkins (2002) and Aghion
and Tirole (1997).

Accountability is not
the only relationship
The foregoing description is not reality,
because it portrays only one direction in the
relationships between actors. The reality is
that actors are embedded in a complex set
of relationships, and accountability is not
always the most important. Through various forms of coercion, both subtle and blatant, many states’ ability to impose obligations on citizens has proved much stronger
than the ability of citizens to discipline
politicians and policymakers (box 3.2). And
in many cases citizens approach the state
and its agents as supplicants.
Politicians often use the control over
publicly provided services as a mechanism
of clientelism—for both citizens and
providers. In systems that lack accountability relationships, public service jobs (teachers, policemen) are given as political favors,
which creates a relationship not of accountability but of political obligation. A recent
report on education in Nepal, for instance,
ﬁnds that “teachers’ performance standards
are nonexistent. Most teachers are aligned
with one of the many associations formed
on political party lines and appointment
and deployment practices are often determined as a result of individual’s contributions to political activities.”163

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Services are allocated in ways that
reward (or punish) communities for their
political support. Sometimes the ministry is
the agent of the providers, not the other
way around, and providers capture the policymaking. Providers also use their ability to
control services and their superior social
status to intimidate poor people. Rather
than client power, there is provider power.
The political scientist James Scott has
argued that the pressures of “authoritarian
high modernism” can mean that the state
and its bureaucratic apparatus deﬁne a
“thin simpliﬁcation” in order to carry out
services—but that the domination of this
reality over citizens and their complex reality can lead to unintended consequences.

Why establishing relationships
of accountability is so complex
This Report moves beyond what the public
sector should do and emphasizes how public action can be made most effective.
Frontline workers have to have clear objectives, adequate resources, technical capabilities, and the motivation to create valued
services. This cannot be mandated. It is the
result of interactions between strong actors
in each of the key service provision roles.
The ideal: a state that is strong, not weak.
Provider organizations that have a clear
vision and mission of service provision, not
ones that are internally incoherent and
merely process oriented. Frontline
providers acting with professional autonomy and initiative, not tightly controlled
automatons. And empowered citizens who
demand services, not passive “recipients”
who are acted on.
Strong, capable actors need to be embedded in strong relationships of accountability.
But it is difﬁcult to establish such relationships for these services. Why?

•

•

Because there are both collective objectives and private objectives, a system that
created only client power through choice
(say) would meet only individual objectives, not the many public ones.
Because of the multiple, complex objectives of public production and coproduction, it is difﬁcult to create outcome-based enforceability for providers.

Individual interests
and collective objectives
A competitive market automatically creates
accountability of sellers to buyers. The key
information is customer satisfaction, and
the key enforceability is the customer’s
choice of supplier. Competitive markets
have proved a remarkably robust institutional arrangement for meeting individual
interests. But they are not enough for services—for three reasons.

•

•

•

First, the market responds only to those
with purchasing power, doing nothing to
ensure universal access or an equitable
distribution, which societies often have
as a collective objective.
Second, the sum of the individual interests may not produce the best outcome
because markets may have failures of
various kinds.
Third, other collective objectives require
public action. For instance, the state and
society have a strong concern about the
role of schooling in the socialization of
youth and may not want parents to
choose for themselves.

The problem of monitoring
Locally produced services—basic education, health care, urban water supply and
sanitation—have three characteristics that
make it particularly difﬁcult to structure
relationships of accountability. They are
discretionary and transaction-intensive.
There are multiple tasks and multiple principals. And it is difﬁcult to attribute outcomes.
Discretionary and transaction-intensive.
Services are transaction-intensive, and the
transactions require discretion. Teachers
must continuously decide about the pace
and structure of classroom activity. Have
the ideas been grasped? Will another example reinforce the idea or bore the class? A
doctor has to make decisions about diagnosis and treatment based on the speciﬁc case
of the patient. The examples differ from
other public sector activities that are discretionary but not transaction-intensive, such
as setting monetary policy or regulating a
monopoly—or those that are transaction-

07_WDR_Ch03.qxd 8/14/03 7:59 AM Page 53

The framework for service provision

intensive but not discretionary, such as taking in bank deposits or controlling trafﬁc.
Services may be transaction-intensive
and discretionary, but some stages in service provision may be less transactionintensive or discretionary (table 3.2). Even
in the health sector, services span the range.
For immunization, the appropriate action is
nearly the same for each individual of a
given age (easily observed). The problems
in implementation, while formidable, are
primarily logistical. But for curative services, providers have to respond to complaints from individuals and exercise discretion in choosing treatment.
Services that are both discretionary and
transaction-intensive present challenges for
any relationship of accountability—because
it is difﬁcult to know whether the provider
has performed well. Administrative and
bureaucratic controls that work well for
logistical tasks are overwhelmed when they
attempt to monitor the millions of daily
interactions of teachers with students,
policemen with citizens, case workers with
clients, medical practitioners with patients.
Rigid, scripted rules would not give enough
latitude.
Multiple principals, multiple tasks. Public
servants serve many masters. Power and
water providers are under pressure from
different segments of the market to crosssubsidize them—from producers to buy
speciﬁc types of equipment, from people
who want more extensive connections, and
from others who want more reliable, continuous operation. The day-to-day pressure
of local demand for health care can compromise efforts in disease prevention and
other public health activities that are not
demand-driven.164
Personnel in health clinics are supposed
to provide immunizations, curative care to
people who come to them, health education
and other preventive measures to everyone
(whether they come in on their own or
not), keep statistics, attend training sessions
and meetings, and do inspections of water
and food. Police ofﬁcers have to deal with
everyone from lost children to dangerous
criminals. This diffusion blunts the precision of incentives (box 3.3).

53

Attributability
The third problem in monitoring service
provision is that it is often very difﬁcult to
attribute outcomes to the actions of the
service providers because there are important “co-producers.” As chapter 1 emphasized, health and education outcomes are
mainly produced in households and communities. The health of individuals
depends on their decisions about nutrition
(constrained by income), activity levels,
personal hygiene practices (often constrained by the availability of water)—and
on community factors that determine
exposure to pathogens. Even if people seek
treatment when they are sick, the effectiveness of treatment depends in part on
provider quality and individual compliance
with the recommended therapies.
The difﬁculty in monitoring discretionary, transaction-intensive services is not
unique to the public sector—it is inherent in
services. Patients generally know how they
feel. Studies of private practitioners in India
commonly ﬁnd practices that lead to shortrun improvement in symptoms (such as
steroid shots) but are not medically effective—or are even counterindicated.165
Patients feel better, and this attracts repeat
customers. But it does not create real
accountability, because simply being pleased
with the service is not sufﬁcient information.

BOX 3.3

Creating conditions of accountability: the police

Police are delegated substantial powers—to
compel and, if necessary, to use violence. What
objectives should they pursue, and how could
they be held accountable?

• “Client satisfaction” is not what should drive
police, for who is the “client”? Certainly not
the criminals, and certainly not just the victims: there are many objectives—creating a
safe environment, apprehending criminals,
respecting individual rights and dignity.

• Police cannot simply follow a script—they

have to exercise discretion. If they went “by
the book” and enforced every infraction, more
important activities would grind to a halt.

• They rely on many co-producers. Without the

cooperation of citizens in abiding by the law,
reporting violations, helping in investigations,
the job of the police would be impossible.
And many determinants of crime are not
under the control of the police, such as economic trends, social changes, and
demographic shifts.

The recipe for inefﬁciency, abuse, and corruption: simply turn individuals loose with

vague objectives, lots of discretion, little performance information, few mechanisms of enforceability (either internal or external), and the public authority to compel (and often too little
budget). A frequent complaint of poor people is
the abuse they suffer from the police. As one
Kenyan put it recently “You cannot carry much
money with you these days.There are too many
policemen.”
There are no easy answers.“Privatizing”
policing functions would face the same problems: what would be the measure of output to
determine what the ﬁrm should be paid? Crime
rates? They are not under police control (and
they would deter reporting). Arrests? That would
encourage false arrests to meet production quotas. Surveys of citizen perceptions of safety?
These risk overzealous police violating the
rights of the socially disadvantaged to please
the minority. Penalties for abuse of authority?
Police might then do too little.
Recent experience in several cities, notably
New York, shows that better measurement of
several important outputs is possible. Crime
rates were measured by neighborhood,
reported regularly as a management tool, used

to allocate police time and visibility. Crime rates
fell signiﬁcantly.This approach can backﬁre,
though, if the desired outcomes are not well
speciﬁed. Studies of police behavior in London
and Los Angeles showed that the monitored
and numerically measured activities (crime rates
and citizen complaints) improved markedly. But
other measures—community activities and
crime rates, particularly for homicide—got
worse.
So there is no general “optimal” solution. But
there are solutions to particular cases, better or
worse in their adaptation to local circumstance.
Creating more functional police services
requires creating multiple institutional channels
of accountability—political (police are not simply an instrument of oppression), compacts
(policymakers can hold police in check), management (organizational strategies can
inculcate dedication, loyalty, restraint), and client
power (citizens have mechanisms to inﬂuence
police behavior directly, a free press).
Sources: Moore and others (2002); The Economist
(2002); Burguess, Propper, and Wilson (2002); Prendergast (2001).

Many outcomes, even when observable to
the patient and the doctor, are not “contractable” in the sense of being able to prove
compliance to a judge or other mediator if a
dispute arises.

polar positions, using the ﬁve failures of
services detailed in chapter 1—inaccessibility, dysfunctionality, low technical quality,
lack of client responsiveness, and stagnant
productivity.

Successes and failures of the
public sector and the market

Public production

Discussions of public action often juxtapose two polar extremes for the institutional arrangements for services: traditional
public production, in which all public
action and resources are channeled through
a public sector organization with civil servants; and market production, in which the
public sector takes a minimal role (but at
least establishes the basic conditions for a
market, such as enforcing contracts).
This Report seeks to help the public sector meet its responsibility for health and
education outcomes. The public sector can
discharge its responsibility by engaging in a
variety of institutional arrangements for
service provision, including direct production, contracting out, demand-side transfers, and so on. Before getting to them, it
helps to illustrate the weaknesses of the two

Two of the most powerful innovations of the
long 20th century (1870–1989) are the
mutually reinforcing ideas of the nationstate, with extensive powers and responsibilities, and the civil service bureaucracy.
Together they produced the consensus that
governments have responsibilities for the
welfare of their citizens, and that the most
effective way to fulﬁll these responsibilities is
through the direct production of services
through a public sector organization with
civil service employees. The contested ideologies of the 20th century—communism,
capitalism, democracy—pale before the
power of the twin ideas of a nation-state and
a public sector bureaucracy. These ideologies
were merely notions of the uses for the
nation-state and its bureaucracy.
As just one example, schooling in the
middle of the 19th century was almost

07_WDR_Ch03.qxd 8/14/03 8:00 AM Page 55

The framework for service provision

exclusively in private hands (largely religious). Today the direct production of
schooling by the public sector—with the
nation-state the dominant service provider,
involved in every facet of schooling from
building schools, to determining the curriculum and texts, to training, hiring,
assigning, and controlling teachers as civil
servants—has completely triumphed as an
idea, so completely that people forget it was
ever contested (box 3.4).
Public bureaucracies are truly a blessing
of modern life. All countries with high living standards have teachers who teach,
police ofﬁcers who police, judges who
judge, public works that work, armies that
respond to external threats. Yes, bureaucracies might be frustrating, slow, inefﬁcient,
and resistant to innovation. But the fantasy
of “getting rid of the bureaucracy” would
turn into a nightmare. No country has
developed without state reliance on an
effective public bureaucracy to discharge
the key functions of the state—though not
always through direct production. So why
do some bureaucracies perform badly and
others well? And how do countries get from
badly to well?
The analytical framework of the relationships of accountability provides a way
of diagnosing not just the symptoms of
poor performance (inefﬁciency, corruption,
poor performance) and not just the proximate determinants of these symptoms (lack
of resources, low motivation, poor training,
and little capability). It also provides a way
of analyzing the deep institutional causes of
poor performance.
In public sector production the direct
link of client power is frequently missing, so
successful public production relies on
“long-route” accountability. What does that
take? The policymaker must care about outcomes, including those for poor people.
That concern needs to be transmitted effectively to the public agencies that receive
public resources to provide the services.
And the public agencies must hire technically qualiﬁed providers motivated to provide the services. When all this happens, as
it often does in developed countries, public
service production is reliable and effective.
Indeed, some of the most admired and

effective organizations in the world are
public agencies.
When the long route is not working, the
framework provides a way to understand
the failures by identifying which relationship of accountability was the weak link—
and within the relationship of accountability, which was the missing dimension.

•

There are voice failures, when the state
(controlled by politicians and policymakers) simply does not care about providing services—or does so in a strictly
venal or clientelist manner. The clearest
sign of this: when too little budget is
devoted to services for poor people, and
when that budget is allocated to meet
political interests.

BOX 3.4

The “Progressive Era”: creation of modern
bureaucracy

Samuel Hays, in his study of the evolution of
conservation policy in the United States in
the early 20th century, expresses eloquently
the political and social tensions in the shift
to modern bureaucracies:
“The dynamics of conservation, with its
tension between the centralizing tendencies of system and expertise on the one
hand and decentralization and localism on
the other, is typical of a whole series of similar tensions between centralization and
decentralization within modern . . . society.
The poles of the continuum along which
these forces were arrayed can be described
brieﬂy. On the one hand many facets of
human life were bound up with relatively
small scale activities focusing on the daily
routines of job, home, religion, school and
recreation in which a pattern of inter-personal relationships developed within relatively small geographical areas. . . . On the
other hand, however, modern forms of
social organization gave rise to larger patterns of human interaction, to ties of occupation and profession over wide areas, to
corporate systems which extended into a
far ﬂung network, to impersonal—statistical—forms of understanding, to reliance on
expertise and to centralized manipulation
and control. . . .To many people the external
characteristics of this process—efﬁciency,
expertise, order—constituted the spirit of
“progressivism.”These new forms of organization tended to shift the location of decision-making away from the grass-roots, the
smaller contexts of life, to the larger

networks of human interaction.This upward
shift can be seen in many speciﬁc types. . . :
the growth of city-wide systems of executive action and representation in both
school and general government to supersede the previous focus on ward representation and action; the similar upward shift in
the management of schools and roads from
the township to the county and state.
“Examination of the evolution of conservation political struggles, therefore,
brings into sharp focus the two competing
political systems. . . . On the one hand the
spirit of science and technology, of rational
system and organization, shifted the location of decision-making continually upward
so as to narrow the range of inﬂuences
impinging upon it and to guide that decision-making process with large, cosmopolitan considerations, technical expertness,
and the objectives of those involved in the
wider networks of modern society. On the
other however, were a host of political
impulses, often separate and conﬂicting,
diffuse, and struggling against each other
with in the larger political order.Their political activities sustained a more open political system . . . in which complex and esoteric
facts possessed by only a few were not permitted to dominate the process of decisionmaking, and the satisfaction of grassroots
impulses remained a constantly viable element of the political order.”

•

There are compact failures, in which the
state fails to communicate clear responsibilities for outputs or outcomes to the
public organization and fails to enforce
any responsibility. Compact failures are
also associated with management failures,
in which the public sector organization
fails to motivate its frontline workers.

All this is embedded in a system in which
the feedback loop from client satisfaction to
both frontline and organizational providers
is cut.
Voice. A common cause of the failure of
public service production is the apathy of the
state. Governments may care about some
services for ideological reasons. But when
voice is weak (or divided or conﬂicted) and
the state is freed from the constraint of satisfying its citizens, there are many possibilities
for failure. The state delivers little or nothing
to its poor and socially disadvantaged citizens, reserving its few services for the elite,
including favored members of the government. In these circumstances alternative
strategies of public sector management will
be powerless to create better services.
Many analysts and advocates point out
that resources devoted to services are inadequate. But those budget allocations are the
result of political decisions: about the level
of taxation and mobilization of resources;
about the allocations of budgets across
activities; about the design of programs that

BOX 3.5

Seeking services in the Arab Republic of Egypt

An anthropological study of urban Cairo
detailing the “Avenues of Participation”—
the ways residents coped with the demands
of the state, and sought its favors—revealed
a pattern common in many countries. First,
there is a huge gap between the formal and
informal realities. As a manager of a familyowned shoe factory explained:
We are caught in the middle of two totally separate systems that do not communicate with
each other.One of them is the legal [formal]
system.The other one is what we call the traditional system,which is much stronger than the
law.That is what really controls us.(p.205).
That gap means that, in approaching
the state, individuals must rely on informal

connections, personal relationships, and
outright bribes to ofﬁcials.There also were
explicit “patron-client” relationships:
In a particular relationship I was able to
observe closely that the ties between
“patron”and the supposed “client”were very
close and reciprocal.The “client”received
loans from the politician, gifts of food and
clothing for her family, publicly subsidized
apartments, employment for her and her
family, assistance with bureaucratic problems,
and a great deal of information. . . . At election
time the client returned this service by organizing the election campaign and marshaling
local political support in the district.

determine who beneﬁts; about the allocation of expenditures across inputs (how
much for wages and other things). If
resources are inadequate, if they are ineffectively applied to service provision for poor
people, it is often because poor people’s
voices are not being heard.
Nor is much information generated that
would allow citizens to judge how effectively their government is providing services. Since information is power, it is often
closely guarded—or never created in the
ﬁrst place. Politicians seldom create information about outputs and outcomes. Individuals know about the quality of the services they confront, but they have a difﬁcult
time translating that knowledge into public
power. Indeed, politicians may use the
selective provision of services as a clientelistic tool to “buy” political support—or,
worse, to enforce state control of citizens
while weakening their voice (box 3.5).
Compacts. The complex compact relationship fails in many ways. In failed or failing states (such as those the World Bank
calls Low-Income Countries Under Stress,
or LICUS) there is no compact because the
state’s control is very shallow. This happens
when countries are embroiled in long civil
wars (Afghanistan, El Salvador, Somalia,
Sudan) or large parts of the country are
beyond the reach of government (Democratic Republic of Congo).
Even in working states the compact relationship between the state and public
provider agencies is often extremely weak.
The delegation and speciﬁcation of goals
are often vague or nonexistent, and there
rarely are clear responsibilities for outputs
or links to outcomes. Budget allocations
and stafﬁng for agencies are determined
without any direct relationship to past performance or clearly speciﬁed objectives.
This means that providers are often underfunded relative to announced rhetorical,
and unrealistic, targets.
Without clear delegation of responsibilities and identiﬁed objectives, there is no way
of generating the relevant performance information for managing or assessing the organization. Without clear information on organizational objectives and progress, it becomes

discourages innovation and responsiveness.
There may be many isolated successes in service provision and striking examples of public servants succeeding even against the odds.
But nothing in the system encourages the
replication of successful innovations.
This is not to deny the enormous beneﬁts
that public provision has attained. But those
beneﬁts have often been in areas in which the
compact relationship is relatively easy
because the targets are numerical and provision is logistical. Strong states, even the politically repressive, have been successful in providing services. Socialist states, such as China,
have had great success in the social sectors.
But moving beyond the impressive logistical
accomplishment and improving quality has
proved much more difﬁcult. Even weak states
can launch and sustain vertical programs of
logistical delivery—expanding childhood
vaccinations in very troubled situations is a
classic example. But going from services provided in “campaign” mode to more discretionary and quality-sensitive services has
proved much more difﬁcult.
Management. Failures of management are
also common in public production of services. Frontline workers rarely receive
(explicit or implicit) incentives for successful
service delivery. There are no stipulations for
service quality and quantity, no measurement
of effectiveness or productivity, few rewards
or penalties. The provider organization monitors only inputs and compliance with
processes and procedures. Even so, some
states have provided some services under
these conditions, but the services remain limited, low in quality, high in cost.
The problems are deep. Quick ﬁxes that
seem too good to be true probably are. One
response to the corruption, absenteeism, and
underperformance of providers is stricter
monitoring. But if the objectives are not well
known and if it is difﬁcult to monitor behavior, it is difﬁcult to assess performance on the
basis of real, relevant output measures. So
“accountability” is instead created by strict
rules, intended to prevent abuse, and
attempts to monitor compliance with some
crudely measured proxies (attendance) or to
reduce the activity to scripts that must be fol-

lowed strictly. That approach can succeed for
truly logistical tasks, but it can also be counterproductive. By constraining the professional autonomy of frontline providers, it
may frustrate self-motivated frontline workers, driving them away and undermining the
development of strong providers.
The goal is to have providers with more
capability, more autonomy, and more discretion in providing quality services. But more
autonomy requires more performance-based
accountability. That is intrinsically difﬁcult to
create because of the multiple (often unobservable) objectives of public action, the
demands of monitoring discretionary and
transaction-intensive services, and the difﬁculty of attributing outputs or outcomes to
actions by providers.
Take schooling (chapter 7): good teaching
is a complex endeavor. The quality of a
teacher cannot be assessed strictly on the
basis of student scores on a standardized
examination. Why not? Schooling has many
other objectives. It is difﬁcult to isolate the
value added. And simply paying and promoting all teachers the same does not motivate
good teaching—it can even lower morale
among motivated teachers.
Perhaps good teaching can be assessed
subjectively by another trained educator—a
head teacher or school principal. But this creates the temptation to play favorites or, worse,
to extract payments from teachers for good
assessments. So the autonomy of school heads
must be limited by accountability, to motivate
them to reward good teachers. There must be
an assessment standard for school heads. But
all the problems of assessing good teaching
also apply to good school heads. Indeed, that
is how dysfunctional bureaucracies cascade
into a morass of corruption, as upward payments from those at lower levels buy good
assignments or ratings from superiors.

The market
The “market,” as an idealized set of relationships of accountability, relies more or less
exclusively on client power—and only on
that part of client power that is based on
choice, backed by purchasing power. Customer power is the main relationship of
accountability. The market has several
strengths in the provision of services—but

also many weaknesses. One strength is that
customers will buy where they perceive the
greatest satisfaction—so organizations have
incentives to be responsive to clients. Another
strength is that since the organizations are
autonomous, they can manage their frontline
providers as they wish. Yet another is that
with a variety of organizations providing services, each can be ﬂexible with innovation
and each has the incentive to adopt successful
innovations (or else lose resources). Markets
produce innovations and scale them up by
trial and error followed by replication and
imitation—for organizational innovation as
well as product innovation.
But for the services in this Report, the
market has three weaknesses.

•

•

•

It responds exclusively to customer power,
so there are no pressures for equity (much
less equality) in the allocation of services
(though it is not obvious that political systems lacking strong citizen voice have any
greater pressures for equity).
It will not, in general, satisfy collective
objectives (simply adding up individual
objectives). For instance, if one person’s
use of adequate sanitation affects those
who live nearby, individuals may underinvest in sanitation.
It can be effective in having customer
power discipline providers only when
the customer has the relevant information about provider performance. In
ambulatory curative care it is easy for
customers to know their waiting time
and to know how they were treated. But
it is very difﬁcult for them to know
whether the medical treatment they
received was effective and appropriate
for their condition.

From principles to instruments
This Report uses the framework of actors and
their relationships of accountability and
power to understand the successes and failures of centralized public service production—and to evaluate reforms and new proposed institutional arrangements for service
provision. Given the failures and limitations
of the traditional model of service provision—the long route—greater reliance will
inevitably be placed on more direct client

inﬂuence—the short route. In some extreme
cases where the long route breaks down suddenly, as in the aftermath of the breakup of
the Soviet Union, reliance on the short route
arises by default (box 3.6). But increased
reliance can be deliberate, forming the basis
of a wide variety of institutional reforms,
each with strong advocates.
In education people believe that schools
will improve with more use of choice
through vouchers, greater community control, greater school autonomy, having more
information about budget ﬂows and more
aggressive testing and school-based accountability. In health people believe that care will
improve through greater demand-side
ﬁnancing (and less public production), more
use of vertical programs for speciﬁc diseases,
and community control of health centers.
Others emphasize solutions that cut across
sectors: community-driven development,
participatory budgeting, power to local governments, “new public management,” and
civil service reform.
All these proposals aim to improve services by changing the relationships of
accountability. All recognize that, though
there are many proximate causes of failure,
the deep causes lie with inadequate institutional arrangements. If frontline workers
(civil servants) in the existing organizations
of public production are frequently absent,
have little regard for clients who are poor, and
lack the technical knowledge to perform their
services well, this inadequate organizational
capacity is the proximate cause of poor services. Too frequently those seeking improvement have focused only on internal organizational reforms—focusing on management of
the frontline workers. If organizational failures are the result of deeper weaknesses in
institutional arrangements (weak political
commitment, unclear objectives, no enforceability), direct attacks on the proximate
determinants (more money, better training,
more internal information) will fail.
Different systems can underpin success.
For example, countries have very different
institutional arrangements in corporate
ﬁnance. Crudely put, in Japan ﬁrms own
banks, in Germany banks own ﬁrms, and in
the United States banks and ﬁrms are separated. All three countries have very high levels

BOX 3.6

Health care in Central Asia and the Caucasus: the long and short of it

The upheavals that accompanied the breakup of
the Soviet Union had serious consequences for
the health sectors of the resulting states. In the
Soviet era, the health system was run, virtually in
its entirety, by the central government. It had its
problems. It was rigidly ﬁnanced on the basis of
inputs rather than outputs. It was extremely
biased toward hospital and specialist care. It
inefﬁciently relied upon high-cost procedures
and long hospital stays relative to other industrial countries. And it was not at all oriented
toward clients. But it worked. Services were free
to all, and particularly in the resource-poor
republics, many in Central Asia, it contributed to
levels of health status—low mortality rates and
high life expectancy—much higher than in
other countries at similar levels of income.
It worked because the two legs of the “long
route”functioned well enough. A commitment to
universal coverage of health and other social services deriving from socialist principles substituted
for “voice”in the form of free political expression.
“Compacts,”or more speciﬁcally direct management, were enforced through means of the substantial control government had over stateemployed providers.There may have been some
support for this arrangement from the “short
route”due to monitoring by local party leaders,
but this was distinctly secondary given the strong
hierarchic management capacity of government.
Then the compact collapsed. Accountability
to policymakers could no longer be enforced—
there was no longer funding or control from the
center. Within the republics, dramatic declines in
income led to similarly dramatic declines in
public funding for the sector. Also, since almost
everything had been produced by the state,
there was no history of setting priorities accord-

ing to the degree of public responsibility each
activity warranted, so the budgets for even
high-priority public goods were not protected.
The resurgence of some vaccine-preventable
diseases as well as the growth of infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis especially)
attest to this.The “compact” leg of the long
route was gone; political structures for the
“voice” leg were (and in some cases still are) yet
to develop, leaving a vacuum.
All of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) countries are struggling to replace
the former system while suffering from the twin
liabilities of declines in income and the legacy
of an unsustainable degree of hospital—and
stafﬁng—intensity inherited from the former
regime.
The pace and deliberateness of reform
strategies have varied substantially among the
CIS countries. In most there has been a marked
increase in the private sector and in fees—both
informal and institutionalized (particularly in
Georgia and the Kyrgyz Republic)—in public
facilities. Both tendencies have meant that private ﬁnancing has become a large part of the
health market—averaging around 40 percent
but ranging from under 20 percent in
Uzbekistan to over 90 percent in Georgia.
Uzbekistan’s retention of a large public sector
reﬂects a more robust economy. Having natural
resources to sell led to a fall in income of only 5
percent between 1990 and 2000 in contrast to
more typical declines of 30 percent in Armenia,
45 percent in Azerbaijan, or the more extreme
cases of 65 percent in Moldova and 70 percent
in Georgia.
Even when there was no deliberate policy of
privatization—the sale of public facilities to a

of income—so it cannot be that any of these
institutional arrangements is incompatible
with economic development. At the same
time, countries with ﬁnancial arrangements
very similar to one of these three have failed
to develop. With many proposed solutions,
does anything go? No. Solutions need to conform to certain principles, but the principles
need to be implemented in ways that are
appropriate to the time, place, and service.
American Indians as a group are the poorest minority in America. Some tribes, such as
the Pine Ridge Oglala Sioux, have severe economic problems (unemployment in 1989
was 61 percent). But others, such as the White
Mountain Apache, do badly, but much better
(unemployment was only 11 percent). As
part of attempts to control them, their gov-

recognized private provider—growth in the private sector was simply a matter of the market
(the short route) taking over when the state
became incapable of ensuring services.
Similarly, the oversupply of hospital beds has
fallen by an average of 40 percent from its 1990
level. Again, whether this was due to a deliberate policy (a 55 percent fall in Uzbekistan—
almost all in public hands) or a simple necessity
because of austerity and closures after privatization (the same 55 percent fall in Georgia) is an
open question.
Reforms under consideration in the CIS
countries generally involve such client-centered
mechanisms as insurance (a conditional
voucher) and capitation schemes, both of which
allow payments to follow patients. Progress is
slow, however. Institutions take time to develop
and the information collection systems necessary for getting good results from insurance
programs are still lacking.
The starting point for the CIS countries is
very different from that of developing countries
in general—too much infrastructure and
resources rather than too little. However, in
many ways the solutions will be similar. Substantially more reliance on the “short route” of
accountability is likely, with government being a
monitor and enforcer of the rules of the game
regardless of who ultimately becomes the direct
provider.

ernments were imposed on them by the U.S.
federal government and varied little across
tribes. The imposed constitutions were reasonably well-adapted to Apache social and
cultural norms, providing a reasonable ﬁt
between formal and informal structures of
power. In contrast, the formal constitution
was at odds with Sioux norms and led to continuing discord between formal and informal
modes of exercising power, precluding the
emergence of effective institutions.166
Many African scholars argue that the roots
of the problems in Africa today lie in the
legacy of colonialism. Nation-state boundaries followed colonial power rather than
African realities. The struggle over how to
adapt or transform the transplanted institutions continues to inﬂuence debates today.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Here is how Mamdani opens his study, Citizen and Subject:

Because institutional reforms change power
relationships among actors, they are political reforms. But politics generally does not
favor reforms that improve services for
poor people. Such reforms require upsetting entrenched interests, which have the
advantage of inertia, history, organizational
capability, and knowing exactly what is at
stake. Policymakers and providers are generally more organized, informed, and inﬂuential than citizens, particularly poor citizens. But reform is possible, even against
these odds.

icant elements of the non-poor. There is
unlikely to be progress without substantial
“middle-class buy-in” to proposed reforms. In
the words of Wilbur Cohen, U.S. Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare under President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s:“Programs
for poor people are poor programs.”168
De Soto’s study of rights to real estate in
urban areas emphasizes that not only are
poor people outside the beneﬁts of having
secure title and claim to their property, but so
are nearly all of the middle class. His study of
the historical evolution of property rights in
the United States strongly suggested that the
response to popular political pressure—not
top-down technocratic design—was the key
to a broad-based system of property rights.169
Since poor people are excluded from many
services, such as primary education or safe
water, improvements in the system are likely
to disproportionately beneﬁt poor people.
But broad coalitions are not always sufﬁcient because some services need to be tailored to destitute and disadvantaged groups
(as in situations of ethnic or gender exclusion). A common obstacle in the access to
services is that the socially disadvantaged are
excluded—as a matter of policy, or because
they feel excluded due to their treatment by
providers, or due to actions of more powerful
social groups within the community itself.
The politics of services for disadvantaged
groups are even more difﬁcult, because coalitions made up exclusively of the powerless are
often powerless.

Change agents—reform champions

Discussions on Africa’s present predicament
revolve around two clear tendencies: modernist and communitarian. For modernists,
the problem is that civil society is an embryonic and marginal construct; for communitarians, it is that the real ﬂesh-and-blood
communities that constitute Africa are marginalized from public life as so many
“tribes.” The liberal solution is to locate politics in civil society, and the Africanist solution is to put Africa’s age-old communities
at the center of African politics. One side
calls for a regime that will champion rights,
and the other stands in defense of culture.
The impasse in Africa is not only at the level
of practical politics. It is also a paralysis of
perspective.167

Pro-poor coalitions for better services
increase the odds for success.
Change agents and reform champions

When the prospects for successful institutional reform are not propitious, strategic

But pursuing it has the danger of being

improvements even when the conditions

and sustain pressures for reform. Professional associations are often both the source
of pressure for, and resistance to, major
innovations. Dissatisﬁed with the progress
in their ﬁeld—education, policing, public
health, sanitation—professionals emerge as
champions for reform, putting pressures on
politicians and policymakers for reform.

vices” balances the unions’ role in protecting the rights of workers with support for
innovation in public service delivery.170
Linking the efforts of these “insiders” and
“technocrats” to broader coalitions of citizens
is often a key element of success.

Strategic incrementalism
Sweeping or fundamental reform of institutions is rare. It requires the right conditions. A
recent study emphasizes how long the development of political institutions in the nowdeveloped countries took (table 3.3). Most
“modern” institutions of “modern” political
and economic governance that are recommended today emerged late in the nowdeveloped countries (at much higher levels
of income than developing countries today).
And they spread slowly across countries. In
the United States universal white male suffrage was not achieved until 1870, female suffrage did not come until 1925, and true universal suffrage did not come until (at least)
1965. Switzerland did not adopt female suffrage until 1971. Canada’s widely discussed
“single-payer” style of health insurance did

not emerge until the 1970s. Institutional
reform that changes the landscape usually
moves at a glacial pace—but glaciers do move
and carve out new landscapes when they do.
The improvement of services, always
pressing, cannot wait for the right conditions.
Some arrangements, such as enclave
approaches to delivering services to poor
people, may not be sustainable in the long
run, even if they improve outcomes in the
short run. Often driven by donors, these
actions can undermine national relationships
of accountability (chapter 11). Sometimes
the desirable arrangement is to strengthen
the weakest link. If the policymaker-provider
link is weak, contracting out services—such
as Cambodia’s use of nongovernmental organizations for primary health services—may
be the preferred arrangement. But incremental activities—pragmatic improvisation to
make services work even in a weak institutional environment—should be used to create more favorable conditions for reform in
the longer run. Temporary work-arounds
cannot and should not substitute for creating
the conditions for reform.

Uganda

Universal primary education—what does it take?
Primary school enrollment in Uganda rose from 3.6 million students to 6.9 million between 1996 and 2001. What
accounts for such a drastic increase in such a short time: Political will? Abolishing user fees? A good macroeconomic environment? Information to empower beneﬁciaries? All of the above.

P

resident Yoweri Museveni’s decision
in 1996 to make universal primary
education an issue in the presidential
election campaign broke with his earlier
position. He had previously emphasized that
building roads and infrastructure would
provide access to markets to enable people to
generate income that would pay for schooling. But in a radio address in March, he
promised to give access to free primary education to four children per family, up to two
boys and two girls, and all orphans.
Although free primary education was
only one part of Museveni’s manifesto, it
soon became clear that the promise had
struck a chord with the electorate. Finance
ministry ofﬁcials recall that several of Museveni’s advisors repeatedly sent them messages
after campaign meetings, emphasizing how
the promise had resonated with the public.
The May 1996 election was Uganda’s
ﬁrst presidential election since the military
takeover in 1986. Though the elections did
not involve ofﬁcial multiparty competition,
President Museveni faced a credible challenger, Paul Ssemogerere, the leader of the
Democratic party. Ssemogerere promised
to restore multiparty politics, negotiate
with the rebel movement in northern
Uganda, and grant greater autonomy to the
Buganda region, once an independent kingdom. These stances positioned him for substantial regional support in northern and
central Uganda. He also declared that he
would match Museveni’s promise to provide free primary education.
In December 1996, soon after a landslide
victory, President Museveni announced the
abolition of school fees. Since then there has
been a sustained shift in Ugandan public
expenditures in favor of education, especially for primary schools. Spending on education has risen as a share of government
expenditures from an average of 20 percent
in the three ﬁscal years preceding the election to an average of 26 percent in the three
years following. Total enrollment in primary
schools skyrocketed (ﬁgure 1).

The argument that free elections contributed to the success in Uganda is buttressed by three observations. Education
was a salient issue for Ugandan voters. The
electorate had access to information about
government performance in this area. And
the success of universal primary education
contributed to President Museveni’s continued popularity.171
For candidates to believe that they will
be judged on whether education promises
are fulﬁlled, education must be important
for voters. Museveni’s 1996 commitment to
universal primary education would have
been expected to draw national support,
while Paul Ssemogerere’s positions on the
northern rebellion, Buganda autonomy,
and reintroduction of political parties
would have been expected to generate
regional support.
Museveni’s victory did not depend on a
single regional base of support. He received
more than 90 percent of the vote in
Uganda’s western region, 74 percent of the
votes in Paul Ssemogerere’s home region
(central), and 72 percent of the vote in the
eastern region.

In the elections in Malawi in 1994 the
winning presidential candidate also made
universal primary education part of his
manifesto, but voting was much more
polarized along regional lines than it was in
Uganda. The winner would thus have had
an incentive to continue to cultivate a
regional base of support, rather than to
deliver on a national issue like education.
Ugandan voters had access to various
sources of information about the education
initiative that enabled them to evaluate how
the government had made good on its 1996
election promises. Major national dailies,
such as The Monitor and The New Vision,
continued to give prominent coverage to
universal primary education issues.
Data collected by the Afrobarometer
project show that Ugandans believe that
President Museveni has performed very
effectively, and in rating government performance they are most satisﬁed with education policy. During the June 2000 survey,
93 percent of respondents reported that
they were either somewhat satisﬁed or very
satisﬁed with Museveni’s overall performance. Eighty-seven percent of Ugandans
reported that their government was handling education issues well, while the average across the 12 African countries was 59
percent.

Democratic politics may have given the
Ugandan government an incentive to deliver
on its education promise of 1996. But success in reorienting public expenditures
toward primary education has also
depended on stabilizing the macroeconomic
environment and developing budgetary
institutions.172 Stable macroeconomic conditions have undoubtedly made it easier to
forecast revenues and expenditures. Under
more unstable macroeconomic conditions,
African governments like Malawi have found
it difﬁcult to maintain a sustained commitment to increasing education expenditures.

Spotlight on Uganda

Uganda’s macroeconomic stability since
1992 has depended on budget reforms—
from a cash budget system to the mediumterm expenditure framework to the Poverty
Eradication Action Plan. The framework
aligns resources with budgetary priorities,
while the cash budget system ensured that
overall ﬁscal discipline is maintained if there
are revenue shortfalls. The Poverty Action
Fund has been particularly effective in ensuring that government spending priorities,
such as primary education, receive needed
funds. It seems unlikely that universal
primary education would have been sustainable without these innovations in budgetary institutions.

The power of information
in delivering funds for education
In 1996 a public expenditure tracking survey of local governments and primary
schools revealed that only 13 percent of the
per-student capitation grants made it to the
schools in 1991–95.173 In 1995 for every
dollar spent on nonwage education items
by the central government, only about 20
cents reached the schools, with local governments capturing most of the funding.
Poor students suffered disproportionately, because schools catering to them
received even less than others. Indeed, most
poor schools received nothing. Case study
evidence and other data showed that the
school funds were not going to other sectors either. The disbursements were rarely

audited or monitored, and most schools
and parents had little or no information
about their entitlements to the grants. Most
funds went to purposes unrelated to education or for private gain, as indicated by
numerous newspaper articles about indictments of district education ofﬁcers after the
survey ﬁndings went public.
To respond to the problem, the central
government began publishing data on
monthly transfers of grants to districts in
newspapers and to broadcast them on the
radio. It required primary schools and district administrations to post notices on all
inﬂows of funds. This promoted accountability by giving schools and parents access
to information needed to understand and
monitor the grant program.
An evaluation of the information campaign reveals a large improvement. Schools
are still not receiving the entire grant (and
there are delays). But the capture by interests along the way has been reduced from
80 percent in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001
(ﬁgure 2). A before-and-after assessment
comparing outcomes for the same schools
in 1995 and 2001—and taking into account
school-speciﬁc factors, household income,
teachers’ education, school size, and supervision—suggests that the information campaign explains two-thirds of the massive
improvement.
In 1995 schools with access to newspapers and those without suffered just as
much from the leakages. And from 1995 to

63

2001 both groups experienced a large drop
in leakage. But the reduction in capture was
signiﬁcantly higher for the schools with
access to newspapers, which increased their
funding by 12 percentage points over
schools that lacked newspapers.
With an inexpensive policy action—the
provision of mass information—Uganda
dramatically reduced the capture of a public program aimed at increasing access to
textbooks and other instructional materials. Because poor people were less able than
others to claim their entitlement from the
district ofﬁcials before the campaign, they
beneﬁted most from it.

Clients and providers

chapter

The well-being of poor people is the point of
making services work. The value of public
policy and expenditure is largely determined
by the value the poor attach to it. When
publicly provided and funded housing is left
vacant,174 when food supplies are not eaten,
when free but empty public health clinics
are bypassed in favor of expensive private
care,175 this money is wasted.
Improving services means making the
interests of poor people matter more to
providers. Engaging poor clients in an
active role—as purchasers, as monitors, and
as co-producers (the “short route”)—can
improve performance tremendously.
How can public policy help poor people
acquire better services through this route?
By expanding the inﬂuence of their own
choices. By having the income of providers
depend more on the demands of poor
clients. By increasing the purchasing power
of poor people. And by providing better
information and a more competitive environment to improve the functioning of services. Where such choice is not feasible,
governments can expand consumer power
by establishing procedures to make sure
complaints are acted on.
Sad to say, governments and donors frequently neglect the possible role of poor
clients in sustaining better services—or
treat that role merely as an instrument for
achieving a technically determined outcome. Neither governments nor donors are
accustomed to asking the poor for advice.
Recent initiatives have begun to redress this
through a variety of ways to increase participation by communities and civil society.
But the potential for improvement has not
yet been adequately tapped.176
In short, the key is to enhance the power
of poor clients in service provision. This

Report and this chapter try to give the term
“empowerment” a precise and concrete
interpretation. Speciﬁcally, the chapter discusses the potential for poor people to
inﬂuence services by:

•
•
•

Increasing their individual purchasing
power.
Increasing their collective power over
providers by organizing in groups.
Increasing their “capacity to aspire”177:
allowing them to take advantage of the
ﬁrst two by increasing the information
needed to develop their personal sense of
capability and entitlement.178

When will strengthening
the client-producer link
matter most?
In the framework of chapter 3, improving
client power—the short route of service delivery—can overcome various weaknesses of the
long route (ﬁgure 4.1), even when services
remain the responsibility of government. The
clearest case is monitoring providers. Clients
are usually in a better position to see what is
going on than most supervisors in government hierarchies—who provide the compact
and management. When the policymakerprovider link is weak because of scarce or difﬁcult-to-manage supervisory staff, clients may
be the only ones who regularly interact with
providers. As discussed several times in this
Report, improvements in basic education have
often depended on participation by parents.
Although parents cannot monitor all aspects
of education, they can monitor attendance by
teachers and even illiterate parents can tell if
their children are learning to read and write.
Citizens as clients can also make up for
shortcomings in the voice or politics relation-

Clients and providers

ship. If governments cannot or will not try to
determine and act on the desires of the public, or if the desires of poor people are systematically ignored, there may be few options for
poor communities but to develop mechanisms for getting services some other way.
The greater the differences among
clients—their heterogeneity—the more that
direct client power is likely to have an advantage relative to the “long route.” The greater
the individual differences in preferences for
the type and quality of services provided, the
greater the importance of discretion on the
part of providers and the more difﬁcult it is
to monitor the use of this discretion centrally.
Sometimes preferences differ geographically,
so different levels of government may reﬂect
this variation. But for many services, the heterogeneity of preferences applies all the way
down to the individual. Take courtesy and
comfort (caring) relative to technical skill
(curing) in health delivery—or farmers with
constraints on their time and other workers
in the same community with different constraints. Certainly people differ in the
amounts of water and electricity they want,
given their other needs. Government structures may not be ﬂexible enough to accommodate this variety. And where local preferences vary systematically between the poor
and others, honoring poor people’s preferences over those of the better-off can be a
challenge.
For some collective action problems, governments may not be located at the correct
level to solve them, no matter how willing
they are to pursue the interests of the poor.
The boundaries of the political jurisdiction
may not correspond to the boundaries of the
problem. So schools are often the most
appropriate unit for management and operation. Sanitation services need community
pressure to ensure that everyone uses ﬁxedpoint defecation, but they are often organized
around communities that are larger or
smaller than villages, depending on the density of population. A more active role for
communities is needed in such cases.
It is important to avoid romanticizing
either form of increasing client power—neither choice nor participation is sufﬁcient for
all services. Market failures and concerns for
equity lead societies to want to improve or

extend these services in the ﬁrst place. There is
no reason to believe they are all self-corrective
through replicating aspects of the free market.
Similarly, some settlements constitute
communities with sufﬁciently congruent
interests among members, egalitarian norms
to protect the poor, mutual trust, and the
ability to mobilize information and to act
collectively—that is, they have social capital.179 But some clearly do not. How many villages and urban neighborhoods are there in
the developing world? Hundreds of thousands? Millions? And how many kinds of
social structures are represented? Ensuring
that poor people have a say in this variety of
circumstances demands that policies be
examined and designed with a great deal of
local knowledge and an understanding of
local conﬂicts and inequalities. Pretending
otherwise will almost certainly do real harm.
And some services, particularly for health
and modern water and sanitation, need technical inputs to be successful. Patients—as
individuals or health boards—are good
judges of courtesy and attendance. But they
are much less able to judge clinical quality or
the appropriate mix of curative and preventive services. And some health problems have
effects that spill over community boundaries.
Large pest-control initiatives and other forms
of infectious disease control may seem a low
priority for any one group of citizens, yet will
be effective only when all participate. Ultimately, some wide-scale government intervention is necessary. Still, emphasizing the
power of clients is a welcome tonic for the
top-down, technocratic orientation that has
characterized much development thinking
until now.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Increasing client power
through choice

•

The most direct way to get service providers
to be accountable to the client is to make
whatever they get out of the transaction
depend on their meeting client needs and
desires. That is, money (usually) or other beneﬁts from providing the service should follow
the client—the enforceability of a relationship
of accountability, discussed in chapter 3.
In market transactions, this is done by a
buyer paying money to a seller. But that is
not the only way. Payments by government
to schools (and the pay of teachers) can
depend on the number of students enrolled
and continuing. The vast majority of primary education in the Netherlands is paid
for by government but delivered by private
schools compensated in this way. Capitation lists are the dominant method of pay
for general practice medical providers in
several European systems, particularly the
United Kingdom. Overall consumer satisfaction can be expressed through the possibility of changing general practitioners,
determining their income.
Vouchers issued to consumers are another
method of linking service provider compensation to consumer choices, even though the
consumer is not the original source of funds.
All health insurance with some choice of
provider is a form of voucher—one conditional on being sick. And intrinsically motivated providers, whose sense of self-worth
depends on having a large demand for their
services, try for more patients under any payment system. The essence of each of these
methods is that client well-being translates
directly into provider well-being—the incentives are aligned.
Many service problems can be improved
by making sure that payment follows clients.
Most of the evidence for this comes from
studies examining the effect of fees on the
behavior of private providers (who must, of
course, operate this way) but it applies to all
such methods. Payment can have four kinds
of beneﬁcial effects:

The ﬁrst two work through providers, the
second two through clients.

•
•
•

Improve provider behavior.
Increase supply and sustainability.
Increase vigilance and a stake in receiving better service from each transaction.

Make better choices about which services to demand.

Provider behavior
Discourtesy, social distance, abruptness of
care, discrimination against women and ethnic minorities, service characteristics mismatched to individual tastes—all are associated with provider behavior. And all can
improve with the purchasing power of
clients. Indeed, that is why the private sector
is often seen as preferable to a public sector
with staff paid by salaries (box 4.1). These
differences are echoed in studies from countries as diverse as Bangladesh, China, India,
Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam.
For courtesy, caring, and convenience the
private sector usually has a distinct advantage. Private practitioners usually provide
services more convenient to the client. Limited hours in public facilities (only in the
morning in farm communities) is often the
reason people go to a private practitioner.180
What accounts for the difference? Not the
training but the motivation: “. . . the same
government doctor who was not easily or
conveniently accessible, whose medication
was not satisfactory and whose manner was
brusque and indifferent transformed into a
perfectly nice and capable doctor when he
was seeing a patient in his private practice.”181
Why? Because the doctor wants the client to
return. If the staff is paid through salaries,
there is no strong incentive to be accommodating. This is not lost on clients: “Anyhow,
they will get their money, so they don’t pay
much attention.”182 Discrimination, particularly against ethnic minorities and women,
and social distance are barriers to services
even when the services are free, barriers that
frequently yield to market forces.183 The artiﬁcial scarcity of free services—ensuring
excess demand—induces rationing by some
other means (social status, personal connections, ethnicity), and poor people rarely have
these other means. Groups coping with social
stigma—such as prostitutes, who need to be
part of the battle against HIV/AIDS—often
prefer the conﬁdentiality and more considerate behavior in private clinics.

Clients and providers

The scarcity of commodities due to low
pricing may lead to other commonly
reported problems—illicit sale of materials
and the demand for under-the-counter payments. Indeed, “free” public services are often
very expensive. Many countries have serious
diversions of pharmaceuticals from the public stock into private markets, where they
instantly become expensive. In general, services that most directly resemble market
goods have a greater problem of diversion
and implicit privatization.
In Eastern Europe the health systems are
often ranked among the most corrupt of
public services (box 4.2). Under-the-table
payments and pharmaceutical sales to open
markets are the main elements in this assessment. If directives against such practices cannot be enforced, countervailing pressure is
needed (see box 3.6). Formalizing fees and
putting purchasing power in the hands of
poorer clients is one possible source of such
pressure.184
Exemptions from fees can have perverse
effects by reducing this purchasing power. In
Benin a measure to raise female school
enrollment—waiving fees for girls—led
teachers to favor the enrollment of boys and
to raise informal fees for girls.185 Of course,
the problem could have been solved by abolishing fees for everyone (if the teachers could
continue to be paid) or by closer monitoring
and enforcement by education ofﬁcials. But
in a system that has problems paying teachers
and weak administrative capacity, bolstering
the ability of girls to pay with vouchers seems
more likely to succeed.

Increase and sustain supply
Greater purchasing power may simply
increase supply and overcome bottlenecks
due to supply problems. In Bangladesh the
Female Secondary School program awards
scholarships to girls if they attend school regularly and gives secondary schools a grant
based on the number of girls they enroll. Secondary school enrollment in Bangladesh is
increasing, and faster for girls than for boys. It
also led to the establishment, at private
expense, of new schools. Desires for singlesex schools and separate toilet facilities for
girls were mysteriously accommodated when
girls’ attendance meant more money. True,

there remain problems, such as ensuring the
quality of the newly established schools, but
these are secondary to getting girls to school.
The revenues that providers raise from
charges at the point of collection are often the
reason some services can continue at all.
Much of the success of the Bamako Initiative
in West Africa (see spotlight) stems from the
supply of pharmaceuticals made possible by
charging users for them. Bamako Initiative
villages usually have drugs, other villages usually don’t. Sustainability in piped water systems is almost always equivalent to ﬁnancial

Health systems rank highest overall, but with
answers ranging from 11 percent in Bulgaria to

sustainability. There might be some subsidy
element included in pricing, but systems to
get water to a private home depend on
charges for that water.

Increased client stake—and vigilance
The third argument for having money follow clients: when people buy things they
make sure they get them, and they pay more
attention to the quality of what they get.
Money is a profound source of power for
poor people. When Zambian truck drivers
were expected to pay into a road fund, they
took turns policing a bridge crossing to
make sure overloaded trucks did not pass.
Their money would have to be used to ﬁx
the bridge. Women living in slum areas of
Rio de Janeiro proudly display bills they
paid for water and sanitation—it proves
their inclusion in society and their right to

services.186 Farmers in southern India
expect the same from irrigation services
(box 4.3).

Making better choices
For some services consumer discretion is
important for allocating resources efﬁciently.
Households determine water and electricity
use, scarce goods that have costs associated
with them. And facing marginal costs is the
only way to ensure efﬁcient use. The alternatives: wasted water leading to shortages,
unreliable service with serious consequences
for the safety of the water supply, and periodic cuts in electricity familiar to most people in developing countries. Protecting the
poor in network services can be achieved
(assuming that meters work) with “lifeline”
subsidies, in which the ﬁrst few essential
units are free but full marginal costs are paid
beyond this level.
In health care, as in water and electricity,
more is not always better. Restricting
demand for curative services by pricing
frees up providers, particularly public
providers, to do preventive health, for
which there is little private demand.187 As
the director of a prominent nongovernmental organization providing health care
to the very poorest in Bangladesh puts it:
“Of course you must charge at least a token
amount for services, otherwise you keep
seeing people with paper cuts and other
minor things.”188 Similarly, crowding at
outpatient clinics at public hospitals can be
curtailed by charging enough so that people
use a cheaper level of service.
All these advantages can be obtained in
ways other than charging fees at the point of
service. As long as clients consider the
resources used as belonging to them, the discipline of market-like mechanisms can be
enforced. The Singapore Medical Savings
Accounts do this by allowing people to apply
funds not used for primary medical care to
other purposes, such as pensions.189 Countries with scarce administrative personnel
and supervisory capacity may certainly want
to enlist clients as monitors, and market
mechanisms are one way of doing it.
For any of these mechanisms to work,
however, there must be a real choice with
real options. Otherwise, giving schools pay-

Payment and
accountability

A conversation with farmers in Haryana state in
India, who had been to see what had happened

ment. In some cases the market would be
expected to wither away as the state increases
its capabilities. In the meantime, three categories of policies can make the most out of
clients acting on their own behalf:

•

Q: “What did you learn when you visited AP?”
A: “That the farmers are much poorer than us,
but that they pay four times as much for
water”
Q: “The farmers in AP cannot be happy about
that. . . .”
A: “They are happy, because now the irrigation
department is much more accountable to
them . . . they know where the money goes
and they have a say in how it is spent. . . .”
Q: “So then, you much richer farmers would be
willing to pay more?”
A: “Only if the irrigation department makes the
same changes, otherwise we will refuse to
pay.”
Q: “Ah, but this is just because there is a particular Chief Minister who is pushing that now . . .
once he goes it will all go back to the same
old way.”
A: “We also wondered about that, and so we
asked the farmers in AP about that.They told
us that ‘no matter who is elected as CM, we
will never allow the government to again
give us free water.’”

ments on the basis of enrollments is not far
from what happens now in centrally owned
and managed school systems, with all the
problems we are trying to ﬁx. Conversely,
market mechanisms with a natural monopoly don’t improve matters either. There is
no denying that sparsely populated rural
areas—where many of the world’s poor
people live—are much more constrained by
competitive supply than urban areas. But
even these markets may be “contestable” in
the sense that other providers would be able
to enter the market if the current provider
abused monopoly power or if monopolies
were periodically granted on the basis of
competitive bids.

Policies to improve choice
Choice-based improvements alone cannot be
a solution to the problem of bad services for
the poor, though some may remain as instruments in a longer-run strategy by govern-

•
•

Increasing the power of the poor over
providers by providing them with
ﬁnance directly.
Increasing competition.
Increasing information about services
and providers.

Increasing the purchasing power of the poor.
The big problem with services that can, in
principle, be provided in markets is that
poor people don’t have enough money to
pay for them. For market mechanisms to
help the poor, their purchasing power must
be increased. The voucher mechanisms discussed are a direct way of handling this for
speciﬁc services. But additional mileage can
come from more ﬂexible transfers that can
be used for purposes that the family chooses.
Flexible transfers can help to overcome
the weakness of the citizen-policymaker link
by giving poor people more direct say in what
gets delivered than even the political process
would give them—the transfers become their
money. Substantial work in South Africa has
shown the beneﬁcial effects of cash pension
payments on the health and well-being of all
members of a family.190 For services with
large externalities, demand for the service
may not be great enough, even when the service is free, so the Bolsa Escola program in
Brazil paid families to send their children to
school, as did the secondary school program
for girls in Bangladesh, while the Education,
Health, and Nutrition Program (Progresa) in
Mexico paid families to use preventive health
care (see spotlight).
Cash payments have problems though.
First, giving unconstrained cash transfers to
poor people is often not politically palatable.
Second, cash payments always have to be
administratively targeted, which requires
determinations of eligibility. Everyone likes
money, so self-targeting of cash transfers is
not possible. If a government has a hard time
getting goods and services into the hands of
the poor, it may well have an even harder time
getting cash, or cash equivalents, to them.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Increasing the scope of competition.
Sometimes increasing competition merely
means allowing a private sector to emerge
where laws previously restricted entry. Jordan, after years of prohibition, allowed private universities in 1990. Ten years later,
enrollments in these institutions accounted
for one-third of all university students.
Bangladesh has had a similar experience in
the past decade. This increase in competition allows governments to increase enrollments without extremely regressive subsidies to public universities.
Competition can also be encouraged by
allowing subsidies to the poor to be
portable between public and private
providers. Private providers may not exist
simply because the public sector is free.
Governments can increase competition by
changing the form of subsidy from zero
price to competitive prices, with cash or
voucher payments to compensate. University education government loans, usable at
any eligible institution, can increase competition, improve quality in public facilities,
and reduce subsidies for all but students
from poor families.
In some cases competition is not possible,
at least not without substantial regulation.
Health insurance markets are notoriously
prone to failure, and competition within
them can lead to both inefﬁcient and
inequitable outcomes, since ﬁrms can compete by excluding the sick, not by being more
efﬁcient. Network services are also hard to
run without a monopoly. But in each case
these markets can be contestable, capturing
much of the beneﬁt of competition.
Some readers may think that the foregoing arguments are just an attempted justiﬁcation for user fees. This is wrong, for all the
reasons put forth here. So, to make things as
clear as possible, the pros and cons of user
fees in general are laid out in box 4.4. There
are times when user fees are appropriate—
and some when they are not. Based on the
primary goal of making services work for
poor people, this Report argues against any
blanket policy on user fees that encompasses
all services in all country circumstances.
Increasing information to improve choices by
consumers. One critical limit to well-func-

tioning competitive markets is the consumer’s
awareness. The private sector is a mixed bag.
Private “medical” providers vary from quite
good doctors (including senior specialists
from government hospitals in their off-hours)
to totally unqualiﬁed, untrained people, some
of whom are downright dangerous.191 Private
or NGO schools may cater to speciﬁc skills not
provided in public schools (foreign language,
religious studies, arts and music) or they may
just be proﬁteers. An essential part of improving peoples’ choices is to provide information
about these providers. Many times, people
simply don’t know enough to choose better or
worse services. And sometimes they identify
good medical care with powerful medicines—which is quite wrong and potentially
dangerous.
Information can be advice to families on
how to choose schools or medical caregivers192 or on how to take care of themselves. This might be supplemented with various certiﬁcation programs, standard setting,
and laboratory checks (say, for water purity).
Scorecards of public services should also be
extended to private or NGO providers. On
the other side of the market, government
may want to directly improve the quality of
private services. Training, “partnership”
arrangements, contracting, and other means
of engagement can all be tried. But attempts
to increase information should be subject to
rigorous evaluation (chapter 6).

Increasing consumer power
through participation
The accountability of providers to clients can
also be achieved when people voice their concerns. In this case, enforceability is not
through clients’ money but through their
direct interaction—encouragement and complaints. The scope for poor people to voice
complaints individually is very small. In rich
countries individuals get help from systems of
tort law that can handle individual litigation
and from government-sponsored ofﬁces of
consumer protection or ombudsmen. But
these are rare to nonexistent for the poor in
developing countries (they don’t always work
so well for the poor in rich countries either).
Some problems for which voice might be
expected to work are intractable. One
example is corruption: the public might

09_WDR_Ch04.qxd 8/14/03 8:12 AM Page 71

Clients and providers

resent under-the-table payments, but there
may be no incentive to complain if, say, a
doctor is using public facilities and materials at the same time. Clients know that the
service is still cheaper than if they had to go
to the market, and so do not complain.193
There is a deeper constraint: even when
there is an opportunity to redress complaints, monitoring and follow-through are
public goods—the beneﬁts accrue to the
entire group while the costs are borne by a
few. This is true for communities as well as
individuals, but groups of people generally
ﬁnd it easier to elicit support from mem-

BOX 4.4

bers than from individuals going it alone.
So client power expressed outside market
transactions will almost always be expressed
through collective action.
Strengthening participation along the
client-provider link can ﬁx problems in the
long route of government provision. So community groups that take on complaining,
monitoring, and other means of making sure
things work properly would be expected at
some point to become institutionalized
within government (most likely local government), or possibly to be supplanted by government as it improves. After all, collective

No blanket policy on user fees

The wide range of services and country
circumstances discussed in this Report
makes it impossible to claim that a particular level of user fees or none at all is
appropriate in every case. User fees, as
with other public policy decisions, must
balance protection of the poor,
efﬁciency in allocation, and the ability
to guarantee that services can be implemented and sustained.The following
ﬂowchart summarizes the arguments
and references in the text and raises
most of the issues necessary in determining whether user fees of any sort
are appropriate in a given case.Three
points:

• First,“efﬁciency” is shorthand for

standard principles of public
economics (see any textbook) that
often but not always require prices
that equal social marginal cost and
may include subsidies, taxes, or other
interventions independent of their
distributional effects. For example,
infectious disease control measures
will have a subsidy element because
of their external effects regardless of
their impact on poor people.

• Second, it is assumed that all subsi-

dies are paid for by taxes.The net
effect on poor people depends on
their contribution to tax revenue
(possibly substantial when taxes are
based on agricultural exports) and on
their share of the deadweight loss
that taxes impose on the economy.

• Third, even when prices are not

charged at point of service, communities may want to make
contributions to capital costs by, say,
helping to construct or maintain
schools.

Is the service excludable?
Possible to keep people who
do not pay from beneﬁting?

No

Can poor people be

No

Transfer money to poor people and
charge user fees.
Charge for service with exemptions
for poor people. Targeting can be
administrative, geographical, or via
self-selection.

Yes

“Lifeline” price schedule. For water and electricity, charge full
marginal costs of services for use above speciﬁed maximum.
Make first few visits for medical care per year free for everyone.

No

Charge for service. Empirically, this may apply to many services.
Example: for higher education institute loan programs without
subsidy.

No

Charges are a necessary evil. Requires honest appraisal of ability
to deliver services along “long route.” If teachers or medical
providers cannot be supervised and medical stores not
maintained by government, then clients, by default, must bring
purchasing power to bear. Revolving drug funds through the
Bamako Initiative, irrigation charges (see box 4.3), possibly many
others including primary education if government is not reliable.

Yes

Charge fees at a level that balances distributional effects with
efﬁciency. Water (taps left running), electricity (interrupted
service from overuse). Also applies to curative care if staff time
available for higher-priority public health activities is crowded out
or to outpatient clinics at hospitals when less expensive to treat
the same problems at lower-level facilities.

No

Do not charge for service. Best example: primary education.
Attendance is limited to one (school year) per child. Social value
is considered high. Poor people use this more than non-poor
(ﬁgure 2.5).

No
Is service disproportionately
used by poor people?
Yes
Will service be adequately
delivered without user fees?

Yes
Will service be overused
without user fees? Is waste
likely to be large if prices are
too low?

action is expensive—people, especially poor
people, have more pressing things to do with
their time. They will want to transfer this
responsibility to permanent structures as fast
as they can.194
But local inputs and knowledge from
direct participation may be needed for some
time, possibly permanently, and government can help make those inputs more
effective. Education provides many of the
better illustrations. Parents are in the best
position to see what is happening in schools,
and schools are usually the unit in which
decisions are most effectively made. So giving parents power to inﬂuence school policies often has beneﬁcial results. In the example of El Salvador’s Community-Managed
Schools Program (Educo—see spotlight), it
was the right to hire and ﬁre teachers and
the regularity of visits from the local education committee, staffed in part by parents,
that led to the increases in teacher and student attendance and in test scores.
Madhya Pradesh, India, has seen substantial improvement in test scores, completion rates, and literacy.195 Community
involvement is strong in recruiting teachers,
getting new schools built, and encouraging
neighbors to enroll their children. Parents
have been helped by the ability to hire local,
less-than-fully-trained teachers at a fraction
of standard pay scales for government
teachers—with better results.
This last aspect of the program complicates scaling up. The ability to avoid confrontation with public sector unions has
been a great advantage. Will teachers’
unions allow such recruitment to become
standard?196 Do teachers hired at low wages
expect to be converted into full public servants? For now, however, the involvement
of communities in Madhya Pradesh, which
is much greater than in other states, has
made a big difference in performance.
Other policy initiatives that can also
make client voice more effective include
offering more convenient venues to air
complaints. Several studies have shown that
the relationship between parents and teachers is important: it should be supportive,
respectful, and cooperative, not punitive
and confrontational. The success of local
communities in improving education can

thus be compromised by too aggressive a
stance. This is true for other professionals as
well. In Kerala, maintaining staff at a health
center became difﬁcult when local residents
made too many demands on providers’
time.197
Beyond monitoring, communities can
be the appropriate locus for more direct
inputs, in effect becoming co-producers of
services. Some services cannot be delivered
by state agencies very well because the environment is too complex and variable—and
the cost of interacting with very large numbers of poor people is too great.198 Sanitation programs often beneﬁt from local participation and inputs, since social relations
in communities are often the best guarantors of compliance with sanitation policies
and compliance must be universal if the
community is to reap the health beneﬁts.
Local perspective and knowledge are critical in transmitting needed information. The
acceptability of messages on health-related
habits, preventive health measures, hygiene,
sexual conduct, and other sensitive issues is
much greater when those messages are conveyed through informal face-to-face contact
in discussions among small groups of individuals with similar backgrounds. For
instance, organized discussions among informal women’s groups can enhance the credibility and impact of behavior change efforts.
It is possible, but unlikely, that outsiders may
learn enough of local mores to inﬂuence local
conversations on these subjects.199

Tapping local social capital
Many communities have evolved means of
solving longstanding problems requiring collective action. When the beneﬁts of cooperation are great enough, there is a way to enforce
rules, and where there are no private alternatives, organizations often emerge on their
own.200 Communities have solved irrigation,
forestry management, nutrition, and other
problems. Recently, governments (sometimes
with help from donors) have started to learn
from this experience, and have funded projects and programs that rely on, and require,
the formation of local user groups and committees to choose and implement development projects. Rather than give transfers of
income to individuals, which can be both

Clients and providers

politically and administratively difﬁcult, governments have channeled money through
community groups. The various approaches
that have been tried address two possible
weaknesses in the “long route” of accountability through governments: implementation, or
the “compact” by single-purpose user groups,
and “voice,” which allows communities to
decide on projects to undertake.
A recent evaluation of six early social
funds, most initiated in response to crises,
found that the programs were progressive,
though more between than within
regions.201 Special-purpose user groups have
been more common. In water supply and
sanitation particularly, there are numerous
cases of better implementation through
such groups. In Côte d’Ivoire, when responsibility for rural water supply shifted from
central government to user groups, breakdowns and costs were reduced.202 Some
local communities have used local contractors, improving accountability and increasing efﬁciency through explicit contracts.203
When governments, especially local governments, are severely hampered in delivering
services, these methods have the potential to
bring about marked improvements.
These programs are new—and changing
as lessons emerge. Because of their potential,
rigorous evaluation is a high priority. Which
aspects are replicable? How can pitfalls be
avoided? Some of the emerging lessons stem
from the difference between groups that
emerge spontaneously and those that are created from above for the purpose of channeling money.
Capture. Groups constituted as a part of projects funded by outsiders may be particularly
prone to capture by elites. Local groups that
evolve as a result of long-felt needs may or
may not be representative of the poorest
people. But when those groups are used by
higher levels of government or by donors to
channel formerly unheard of sums of
money, even representative groups tend to
change. In Indonesia, when participation
was mandated by national government to go
through village councils, the increased participation of some members of communities was found to have a “crowding-out”
effect on others, leading to a net reduction

of participation.204 More recent programs in
Indonesia have beneﬁted from this experience and have been designed to elicit more
widespread participation (see spotlight on
the Kecamatan Development Program).
A real risk comes from the speed with
which groups are constituted and funds disbursed. Elites can mobilize more quickly,
master the rules of submitting applications
(if they can read and the majority of the
community cannot), and present themselves to the community as an effective conduit for receiving such funds. In one Sahelian country a large fraction of project
funds was diverted for personal gain.205
Much of the blame lies with the speed at
which donors want to disburse funds
(chapter 11) and with the limits this puts on
incentives and abilities to monitor the
behavior of leaders. Rushing to create social
capital where it does not exist can do more
harm than good. If there were ever a case
for patience, this is it. It is not merely the
creation of participatory formats but the
encouragement of the abilities of poor people themselves that will have longer-lasting
effects. The policies to look for, then, may
be those of education, freedom of expression, transparency, and time.
The problem of capture is not limited to
groups created for investment purposes. It
also affects existing community groups and
local governments. Both elitism and, in
many cases, gender (men as opposed to
women) can determine who dominates traditional communities and local governments.206 It is not clear that elite capture is
always a problem. Wade (1988) proposes
that mobilizing community action may
require the leadership of the more educated,
connected elite. The lessons, though, are to
make sure that either the types of services
funded by such methods have substantial
public good characteristics (putting health
and education in a sort of “gray” area) or
that the right to leadership is contestable.
Developing government capacity. Some
special-purpose user groups, better funded
than local governments, have drawn off
more capable ofﬁcials to administer their
funds (the same effect is seen at the national
level in other donor initiatives—see chapter

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

11). One hypothesis is that this slows the
development of local government capacity.
But the opposite argument has also been
made—that such groups are a catalyst for
developing local government capacity. In
northeast Brazil, social investment funds
led villagers to organize and petition higher
levels of government to, for example, guarantee a teacher to staff a school built by the
community.207
Sustainability. Participatory water projects, underway since the 1930s and 1940s,
have often improved water supply—at least
for awhile. But at some point water pumps
and other pieces of expensive equipment
break down. Covering the capital cost
(which is expensive) and obtaining the
technical help (also expensive) have always
been the bottleneck for water projects in
poor areas. When a new infusion of capital
is necessary at short notice, the community
must look either to donors or to regular
sources of funds, such as taxes or other general revenue. Eight or nine years after the
original investment, are the donors still
around? Do they have the same priorities
they originally had? Can they respond
quickly to small individual requests? Often
not. These demands will have to be met by
local government,208 and projects have been
evolving to work through them.
Such projects may have been a great deal
better than relying on inadequate government structures. The argument for them is
strongest where the current government
system, especially the local government, is
weak, with few prospects for changing any
time soon.
This should, however, be a tactic that
supports a longer-term strategy of developing governmental capacity—strategic incrementalism, discussed in chapter 3. Caution
is required when there appears to be a
tradeoff between improving services in the
short run and undermining delivery capacity in the longer run. And the political consequences of participatory projects should
be the subject of careful evaluations. All this
complicates bringing these interventions to
scale. It may be possible to replicate community efforts in many places, but whether
this is the best way to make sure services are

delivered to all people is one of the many
open questions on the agenda.

Client power in eight sizes
To sum up, increasing client power through
improved choice or direct participation will
be important when people differ—are heterogeneous in their preferences—or when
either of the two legs of the long route to
accountability is problematic. In terms of
the decision tree (ﬁgure 4.2) that determines which of the eight types of solutions
is appropriate, client power matters at all
three decision points.
Decision 1: Are politics pro-poor? Reliance
on client power should vary with the capacity and orientation of government. Also
with the question of which level of government is problematic. When governments
(central, local, or both) are pro-poor, they
may choose to enlist client groups as monitors or solicit their opinions regularly in
sizes 3 and 4. Sizes 5 through 8, however,
require ways to avoid the problems of government. All four will involve getting information to clients on their entitlements to
and the performance of services.
When levels of government differ in
their commitment to poor people, the role
and sponsorship of user groups differ as
well. If central government is a better champion of poor people, they may fund communities (if preferences vary between
them) or cash transfers or vouchers (if preferences vary within them) in cases 7 and 8.
If local government is better, they can provide or contract for these services. When no
level of government is pro-poor, then
donors, if they are inclined to be involved at
all, might choose to fund community
groups or organizations within civil society,
being careful not to undermine the development of government capacities.
Decision 2: Does heterogeneity matter?
Sizes 3, 4, 7, and 8 directly involve clients.
When preferences differ by location then
decentralization to local government or to
community groups (depending on the
capacity and pro-poor orientation of the
former) makes sense. If they differ by individual, then purchasing power and compe-

2 Central government provision. Government may choose to enlist communities or users as monitors but is optional.
3 Deconcentrated central or local government provision with contracting. If individual, rather than community, variation in preferences
is important, transfers or vouchers targeted to poor can be used but
are optional. If preferences vary by community, local government
can work and direct client input is not essential.
4 Local or deconcentrated central government provision. Government
may choose to enlist communities or service users as monitors. If
preferences vary by individual, vouchers or cash transfers targeted
to poor can be used.
5 Client power—experiment with contracts. If all levels of government
are problematic, community user groups are essential and can be a
source of contracts to private sector or NGOs. Funding may have to
come from donors. If only local is problematic, center can fund communities or poor people directly with transfers. If only the center is
the problem, local government might provide adequately without
direct client input.
6 Client power—experiment with providers. Similar to 5 but relation to
provider cannot be with explicit contracts—more active monitoring
of provider by the community is needed. If one level of government is
pro-poor, it may enlist community input as in size 2. Evaluation and
publicity of efforts of one community help others. Transfers or
vouchers subject to strict rules possible even though service is
uniform.
7 Client power—experiment with community control. Similar to 5 but
requires more discretion, “choice” on part of communities (if funded
by donors or central government in case only the local government is
the problem), by local government (if funded by donors and it is only
the central government that is the problem), or by individuals. The
added discretion is needed due to heterogeneity of preferences.
Explicit contracts with providers are possible.
8 Client power—imitate market. Similar to 7 but explicit contracts are
not feasible. Evaluation and publicity of efforts in one community help
others.

tition for individual business are preferable.
Providing information to clients is critical
for translating their choices into better services.
Decision 3: Is monitoring easy or hard?
When monitoring is easier for clients than
for governments (at any level) then client
input may be required for sizes 2, 4, 6, and
8. Parents of children, patients, and net-

work service users improve services either
by choice in purchasing or by active participation.
It is only in size 1, where government is
perfectly capable of providing services
directly, that client participation is optional.
Possibly size 3 as well if government can
accommodate varying needs of clients. For
all other cases, the client needs to be placed
more ﬁrmly at the center of service delivery.

spotlight on

the Bamako Initiative

Putting communities in charge of health services in Benin, Guinea, and Mali
In some of the world’s poorest countries, putting communities in charge of health services, and allowing them to charge
fees and manage the proceeds, increased the accountability of local health staff and improved health services for the poor.

T

he Bamako Initiative in Benin,
Guinea, and Mali reconciled traditional community solidarity
and provider payments with the objectives of the modern state.209 How? By
strengthening the power of communities
over service providers. Policymakers balanced this power with sustained central
involvement in subsidizing and regulating services—and in guiding community
management.
The initiative improved the access, availability, affordability, and use of health
services. Over the more than 10 years of
implementation in these three countries,
community-owned services restored access
to primary and secondary health services
for more than 20 million people. They
raised and sustained immunization coverage. They increased the use of services
among children and women in the poorest
ﬁfth of the populace. And they led to a
sharper decline in mortality in rural areas
than in urban areas.
Despite the various targeting mechanisms, affordability remains a problem for
many of the poorest families. But even with
limited inclusion of the poorest people,
improvements were signiﬁcant.210

than 10 percent of families used modern
curative services.
The approach focused on establishing
community-managed health centers serving
populations of 5,000 to 15,000 people. An
analysis of the main constraints in the three
countries led to emphasis on service delivery
strategies focusing on the poor.211 Priorities
included:212

Revitalizing health networks

•

In these three countries, serious disruptions to the situation of health services had
occurred during the 1980s as a result of a
severe economic recession and ﬁnancial
indebtedness. The health budget in Benin
went from $3.31 per capita in 1983 to
$2.69 in 1986. In Mali, rural infrastructure
was almost nonexistent, and in Guinea,
health services had almost totally disappeared—except in the capital city,
Conakry—during the last years of the
Sekou Toure regime. The vast majority of
poor families in the three countries did
not have access to drugs and professional
health services. National immunization
coverage was under 15 percent, and less

•

Implementing community-owned revolving funds for drugs with local retention
and management of all ﬁnancial proceeds.

•

Revitalizing existing health centers,
expanding the network, and providing
monthly outreach services to villages
within 15 kilometers of facilities.

•

Stepping up social mobilization and
community-based communication.

•

Pricing the most effective interventions
below private sector prices, through subsidies from the government and donors
and through internal cross-subsidies
within the system. Local criteria were
established for exemptions (table 1).

•

Having communities participate in a
biannual analysis of progress and problems in coverage with health services—
and in the planning and budgeting of
services.
Tracing and tracking defaulters—and
using community representatives to
increase demand.

•

Standardizing diagnosis and treatment
and establishing regular supervision.

Scaling up incrementally
The Bamako approach was implemented
gradually, with the support of UNICEF,
WHO, and the World Bank, building on a
variety of pilot projects.213 Since the early
1980s, it was progressively scaled up in the
three countries—from 44 health facilities in
Benin to 400 in 2002, from 18 in Guinea to
367, and from 1 in Mali to 559. This raised
the population with access to services
within 5 kilometers to 86 percent in Benin,
60 percent in Guinea, and 40 percent in
Mali, covering more than 20 million people. Importantly, a legal framework was
developed to support the contractual relationship with communities, the cost-sharing arrangements, the availability of essential drugs, and community participation
policies. Community associations and
management committees were registered as
legal entities with ability to receive public
funds.

Better health outcomes
for poor people
Over the 12 or so years of implementation
in Benin and Guinea, and more than 7 years
in Mali, health outcomes and health service
use improved signiﬁcantly. Under-ﬁve mor-

tality declined signiﬁcantly, even among the
poorest. The poor-rich gap narrowed in the
three countries (ﬁgures 1 and 2). In Guinea,
the decline was steepest for the rural population and poorer groups.
Immunization levels increased in all
three countries.214 They are very high in
Benin, close to 80 percent—one of the
highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. Immunization rates are lower in Guinea and Mali,
largely because of problems of access (ﬁgure 3). Coverage of other health interventions also increased. The use of health services by children under ﬁve in Benin
increased from less than 0.1 visit per year to
more than 1.0. In Mali exclusive breastfeeding and the use of professional services for
antenatal care,215 deliveries, and treatment
of diarrhea and acute respiratory infections
increased for all groups, including the
poorest (ﬁgure 4).216
In an independent evaluation in 1996 in
Benin, 75 percent of informants were satis-

ﬁed with the quality of care, although 48
percent were not “fully” satisﬁed. Health
care users found the availability of drugs to
be high (over 80 percent said drugs were
available) and the overall quality of care to
be good (91 percent).
Greater access reduced travel costs, and
the availability of drugs reduced the need to
visit distant sources of care. Prices have
been kept below those of alternative
sources. In Benin the median household
spending on curative care in a health center
was $2 in 1989, less than half that at private
providers ($5) or traditional healers ($7).217
Poor people still saw price as a barrier.218
And a large proportion of the poor still do
not use key health services in all three countries. In Benin and Guinea the health system
allowed for exemptions, and most health
centers had revenue that they could have
used to subsidize the poorest, but almost
none did. Management committees typically valued investment over redistribution.

Community ﬁnancing—a seat
at the table
The community ﬁnancing of key operational costs bought communities a seat at
the table. Donors and governments had to
systematically negotiate new activities with
community organizations. Governments in
all three countries, with the support of
donors, continued to subsidize health centers, particularly to support revolving drug
funds in the poorest regions. In Benin and
Mali today the public subsidy to health services is about the same per capita for rich
and poor regions. In Guinea, however, public spending has beneﬁted richer groups
most. But all three countries face the challenge of emphasizing household behavior
change and protecting the poorest and
most vulnerable. Establishing mechanisms
to subsidize and protect the poor remains a
priority of the current reform process.

Citizens and politicians

5

chapter

The most important political ofﬁce is that of private citizen.
Louis D. Brandeis

Citizens’ voice in society and participation
in politics connect them to the people who
represent the state—politicians and policymakers. Unlike the short route of accountability between clients and providers discussed in chapter 4, the long route of
accountability involves politics. That
accountability has two parts: the relationship of voice between citizens and politicians and policymakers (discussed here) and
the relationship between policymakers and
service providers (discussed in chapter 6).
This chapter asks several questions:
Why don’t politicians in well-functioning
democracies deliver education, health, and
infrastructure services more effectively to
poor people even though they depend on
poor people’s votes? Why are public expenditures systematically allocated to construction projects and the salaries of bulky
state administrations, often at the expense
of making services like schooling work?
And why, when the government does
spend money on services that the poor rely
on, such as primary health care, is service
quality so poor? Finally, what can citizens,
particularly poor citizens, do when politicians fail to make services work for them?
Empowering poor citizens by increasing
their inﬂuence in policymaking and aligning their interests with those of the nonpoor can hold politicians more accountable
for universal service delivery. Elections,
informed voting, and other traditional
voice mechanisms should be strengthened,
because these processes—and the information they generate—can make political
commitments more credible, helping to

produce better service outcomes. Nongovernmental and civil society organizations can help to amplify the voices of the
poor, coordinate coalitions to overcome
their collective action problems, mediate on
their behalf through redress mechanisms,
and demand greater service accountability.
Even when these measures have limited
scope, better information—through public
disclosure, citizen-based budget analysis,
service benchmarking, and program impact
assessments—and an active, independent
media can strengthen voice.

Citizen voice and political
accountability
Faced with classrooms without teachers, clinics without medicines, dry taps, unlit homes,
and corrupt police, poor citizens often feel
powerless.219 Elected representatives seem
answerable only to the more powerful interests in society if at all. When politicians are
unaccountable to poor people as citizens, the
long route of accountability—connecting citizens with providers through politicians—
breaks down, voice is weak, and providers can
get away with delivering inadequate services
to poor clients.220 When poor citizens are
empowered, whether on their own or in
alliance with others, their demand for
accountability can make politicians respond
in ways that compensate for weaknesses elsewhere in the service delivery chain.

Services are politically powerful
For poor people the only routine interaction
with the state may be at the delivery point of
services. Election platforms show that politicians are very aware that poor people’s perceptions of the state are shaped by the quality
of services. The 30-Baht Gold Card scheme in
Thailand promised inexpensive universal

Citizens and politicians

Voice is the most complex
accountability relationship
in service delivery
Voice is the relationship of accountability
between citizens and politicians, the range of
measures through which citizens express
their preferences and inﬂuence politicians
(ﬁgure 5.1).224 Accountability in this context
is the willingness of politicians to justify their
actions and to accept electoral, legal, or
administrative penalties if the justiﬁcation is
found lacking. As deﬁned in chapter 3,
accountability must have the quality of
answerability (the right to receive relevant
information and explanation for actions),
and enforceability (the right to impose sanctions if the information or rationale is
deemed inappropriate).225 One complication
is that voice is not sufﬁcient for accountability; it may lead to answerability but it does
not necessarily lead to enforceability.
In principle, elections provide citizens
with both answerability (the right to assess a
candidate’s record) and enforceability (vote
the candidate in or out). In practice, democracies vary greatly on both dimensions, as do
most attempts to exercise accountability. Citizen charters may spell out the service standards and obligations of public agencies
toward their clients, but without redress the
obligations may not be enforceable. In
Malaysia the client charters introduced for

public agencies in 1993 do both, giving
clients the right to redress through the Public
Complaints Bureau if corrective action for
noncompliance is not taken.226
Another complication is that the voice
relationship links many citizens with many
politicians—all with potentially very different interests. When services fail everyone,
the voice of all citizens (or even that of the
non-poor alone) can put pressure on politicians to improve services for all citizens,
including the poor. But when services fail
primarily poor people, voice mechanisms
operate in much more difﬁcult political and
social terrain. Elites can be indifferent about
the plight of poor people.227 The political
environment can swamp even well-organized voice. Protest imposes large costs on
the poor when their interests clash with
those of the elite or those in authority.228 It
then matters whether society is homogeneous or heterogeneous and whether there
is a strong sense of inclusion, trusteeship,
and intrinsic motivation in the social and
political leadership of the country. To
expect poor people to carry the primary
burden of exerting inﬂuence would be
unfair—and unrealistic.
Finally, voice is only the ﬁrst part of the
long route of accountability. That complicates its impact on services, since the impact
depends also on the compact relationship
between policymakers and providers. Even
strong voice may fail to make basic services
work for poor people because the compact is
weak. But the reverse can also be true, as was
the case in the former Soviet Union.

healthcare and helped the Thai Rak Thai
party win a landslide victory in the 2001 parliamentary elections.221 Service delivery was
important for the Labor party’s successful
2001 election campaign in the United Kingdom. A Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit has
been set up to monitor progress.222
Even when services do not ﬁgure explicitly
in elections, politicians often seek to enlarge
their political base by providing free public
services or lucrative service-related jobs to
their supporters. And people are increasingly
concerned about accountability for services
outside the voting process. In Brazil, India,
and South Africa civil society organizations
are analyzing the allocation and use of public
resources in the budget to understand their
impact on the poor.223 With so much political
attention paid to services, why is the voice
relationship often so weak?

Pro-poor and clientelist service
delivery environments
That voice is complex still begs the question
of why, in societies where the average citizen
is poor, services fail poor people. The
answer has to do with whether service
delivery settings are “pro-poor” or “clientelist.” The distinction reﬂects the incentives
facing politicians, whether services are
designed to be universal and available to the
average citizen or vulnerable to targeting to
“clients” by political patrons, and, if formally targeted to the poor, whether they are
in practice captured by elites (table 5.1).
Pro-poor settings are those in which politicians face strong incentives to address the
general interest. Clientelist political environments are those in which, even though
the average citizen is poor, politicians have
strong incentives to shift public spending to
cater to special interests, to core supporters,
or to “swing” voters.229 When the average
citizen is poor, catering to special interests
at the cost of the general interest is clientelism.
The distinction between pro-poor and
clientelist is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation,
but it provides a useful way of thinking
about service delivery mechanisms. Highquality services for all are less likely if politicians cater to special interests rather than to
the interests of the average citizen. Making
services work for poor people is obviously
more difﬁcult in a clientelist environment
than in a pro-poor environment. Less obvi-

ously, if delivery mechanisms do not
account for these speciﬁc country and service differences, they are likely to fail, and
the poor suffer.

The interaction of voice
and accountability
When populations are heterogeneous, it
matters whose voices politicians and policymakers hear and respond to. Where populations are polarized around nonservice
issues—religious, ethnic, caste, or tribal
background, for example—voters care
more about what politicians promise on
these polarizing issues than on services, giving politicians incentives to pursue other
goals at the cost of effective services. Where
politics is based on identities and patronage, the poor are unlikely to beneﬁt from
public services unless they have the right
“identity” or are the clients of those with
political power. In failed or captured states
voice can become meaningless. Politicians
have neither the incentives nor the capacity
to listen.
Under what circumstances, then, is voice
likely to lead to greater accountability? Elections can lead to improved services if the
promises politicians make before elections are
credible. The framework of citizen rights, the
right to information, service design, the inﬂuence of the media, and administrative procedures for redress and appeal are all important
for voice.230 So too is the effectiveness of the
institutions of accountability, such as parlia-

ments, courts, ombudsman, anticorruption
commissions. And so too are higher stocks of
social capital, because they help overcome the
collective action problem underlying voice,
particularly for poor people.231
What can be done to strengthen voice,
particularly for poor citizens, in demanding
better services? The answer depends greatly
on the political setting, but in functioning
democracies with elections and voting, at
least three things should be done.
• Deepen understanding and awareness of
why the politics of service delivery is so
often clientelist and not pro-poor.
• If the politics is clientelist, consider what
changes in the service delivery environment might alter political incentives and
improve outcomes.
• When choosing how to deliver services,
factor in, to the extent possible, the propoor or clientelist inﬂuence of political
competition on the incentives for service
delivery. Recognize and account for government failure arising from clientelism.

The politics of providing public
services to poor people
In 1974 only 39 countries—one in four—
were electoral democracies. By the end of
2002, this had grown dramatically to 121
governments—three in ﬁve.232 Over the last
century, the percentage of people living in
democracies with competitive multiparty
elections and universal suffrage has increased
dramatically (ﬁgure 5.2).
Rapid democratization has brought representation and liberties, but not rapid
improvements in services for poor people.233 Most, if not all, new democracies are
low-income countries with substantial
poverty. Services available to poor people in
these young democracies seem to be not
much different from those available in nondemocracies. In some cases services are
worse than those provided by ideologically
committed but nonelected governments in
single-party, socialist countries. Whether
countries have elections or not seems not to
matter for public perceptions of corruption, and since corruption worsens service
delivery for poor people, by implication for
public perceptions of effective services.234

Political incentives for basic services
If delivered effectively, basic services such as
primary health care and primary education
beneﬁt the poor disproportionately. But
democratically elected politicians in countries where the median voter is likely to be a
poor person, or where poor people constitute the majority of voters, often seem to
have little incentive to provide such basic
services. And voters seem unable to
strengthen incentives for politicians to
ensure better public services. Why?
How politicians and voters make decisions and how politicians compete hold some
answers.235 When politicians have incentives
to divert resources (including outright corruption) and to make transfers to a few
clients at the expense of many, efforts to provide broad public services are undermined.
How easy it is for voters to learn about the
contributions of politicians to a particular
service—and therefore for politicians to
claim credit for the service—differs considerably by service (box 5.1). The degree of political competition is important. For example,
analysis suggests that an increase in the competitiveness of elections seems to have a bigger effect on primary school enrollment than
increases in education spending.236
Three factors therefore appear to be
especially important for inﬂuencing political incentives for service delivery:

•
•
•

How well voters are informed about the
contribution speciﬁc politicians or political parties make to their welfare.
Whether ideological or social polarization reduces the weight voters place on
public services in evaluating politicians.
Whether political competitors can make
credible promises about public service
provision before elections.

Informed voters
The incentives for transfers targeted to
informed voters are greater when voters in
general lack information about the quality
of public services and the role their elected
representatives play in affecting quality. The
same is true if uninformed voters are easily
swayed by political propaganda, or if they
vote on the basis of a candidate’s charisma
or ethnic identity rather than record.

Informed voting can be costly. Detailed
behavioral studies show that voters tend to
adopt simple rules of thumb based on very
limited information about politics and
public policies.237 Most of the information
voters use is likely to be essentially “free,” in
that it comes incidentally with the performance of social and economic roles.238 This
kind of information tends to vary widely
over the electorate, depending on occupation, social setting, and cultural norms. Voters also behave myopically, giving much
greater weight to events around election
times or to service outputs that are immediately visible.239
In principle, citizens could employ voting rules requiring very little information
and still motivate politicians to pursue
policies in their interest—if they could
coordinate their efforts.240 It is harder for
voters to coordinate rewards or penalties
for basic health and education because of
the difﬁculties in evaluating these services
and attributing outcomes to politicians
(see box 5.1). Transaction-intensive public
services such as education and health
depend on day-to-day provider behavior.
Quality is hard to measure and attribute.

BOX 5.1

Information deﬁciencies thus lead voters to
give more credit to politicians for initiating
public works projects (including school
construction), providing direct subsidies
for essential commodities, and increasing
employment in the public sector (including
hiring teachers and doctors) than for
ensuring that teachers show up for class
and can teach—or that doctors come to
clinics and heal.
If voters vote with limited information
or if they are uncoordinated but can be
swayed by propaganda or bribes, specialinterest groups can capture policies by providing campaign ﬁnance or mobilizing
votes.241 These interest groups need not be
deﬁned along rich-poor lines. They could
be organized coalitions of voters (such as
farmers or public sector employees) that
lobby politicians to protect their interests,
pushing for targeted policies at the expense
of policies that would beneﬁt the many.

Social polarization
Social polarization can lead to voting based
on social, ethnic, or religious identity rather
than policy or service delivery performance.
This too limits political incentives to pursue

Why are public health and education services so difﬁcult to get to poor people?

When even the poorest of parents care deeply
about educating their children, why is it so difﬁcult for them to do something to ensure that
the village teacher actually shows up for work
regularly? A political economy perspective on
public service delivery suggests that basic
health and primary education are very difﬁcult
to get right because they are transaction-intensive services with outcomes that depend
crucially on the judgment and behavior of
providers, both difﬁcult to monitor continually,
and on household behavior.

• Learning takes place over long periods and

the beneﬁts of preventive health care are not
always obvious. Compared with other, more
visible public services—electricity or water
connections, rural roads, law and order—
monitoring basic education and health services makes large information demands on
both voters and politicians.

• Poor voters may be uninformed because they
are illiterate.
• Where populations are socially polarized or heterogeneous, households are less likely to have

coordinated, clear preferences in health and
education services.Furthermore, successful outcomes require supportive household behavior,
and very heterogeneous social and cultural
household norms may make households
respond differently to public interventions.

• Because of the difﬁculty of regularly monitor-

ing these services and of measuring and
attributing their long-term impact, it is harder
for politicians to claim credit for these
services than for a road or a well. And politicians who promise to improve these services
may lack credibility and lose elections. For
these reasons, politicians are likely to prefer
infrastructure to human development, and
are prone to using basic health and primary
education services as patronage for clients,
rather than as universal services to be
provided for the general good.

So when poor people are uninformed, society is polarized along social or religious lines,
and politicians lack credibility or are prone to
clientelism, basic public services for poor people
are the most likely to suffer.

Because of political problems of information
and credibility, public antipoverty programs are
more likely to take the form of private transfers,
such as food subsidies, electricity subsidies, agricultural price protection, construction projects,
and public sector employment. Programs of this
kind are easier to capture and more amenable
to targeting than basic health and education,
which are more suited to universal provision.*
That is why programs narrowly “targeted” to the
poor may not be optimal in the sense of having
the most impact on the economic well-being of
poor people.

*van de Walle (1998) concludes, from a synthesis of
research on public spending and the poor, that there is
a well-substantiated case for “broad targeting” of the
poor by allocating greater resources to universal public
services such as basic health and education. In contrast,
ﬁnely targeted food subsidies or other redistribution
schemes may sometimes be detrimental to the interests of the poor due to the burden of administrative
costs and unintended behavioral responses. See also
van de Walle and Nead (1995).

public policies in the general public interest. James Curley, an Irish Roman Catholic
mayor of Boston in the ﬁrst half of the 20th
century, fanned class and religious divisions
for electoral advantage and was repeatedly
reelected despite the damage his policies did
to the city’s growth (box 5.2).
It is this effect of social polarization on
political incentives that partly accounts for
the empirical evidence on the negative correlation between ethnic heterogeneity and
the availability of public goods.242 More
generally, basic public services, particularly
those that are not easily excludable such as
primary education, can also deteriorate
where there is social fragmentation—some
social groups do not want to pay for public
goods that beneﬁt other groups.243

Credible politicians
Even when voters are informed, public policy can fall short when the promises of
politicians are not credible. When candidates cannot or do not make credible
promises before elections (because abandoning promises costs election winners little), incumbents are more insulated from
the disciplining effects of political competition. Challengers cannot mount effective
campaigns because they cannot convince
voters that they will do a better job. Furthermore, if politicians are credible only to
their “clients,” more public resources will be
allocated to these clients. This can have
large implications for universal health and
education services. Incumbents enjoy
greater discretion to pursue goals other
than those preferred by the majority of citizens who may be poor, goals such as providing narrowly targeted services to their supporters at the cost of more universal public
services that beneﬁt all.244
Credibility and credit go hand in hand.
Credibility problems also arise when political competitors make credible promises but
their term in ofﬁce is too short to claim
credit for policies with long maturing outcomes. Promises of jobs or public works
projects can be delivered soon after an election. But promises to improve education
quality and outcomes are much less credible. Similarly, voters can easily credit a

The “Curley effect”

Described as “The Rascal King,” James
Michael Curley dominated politics in Boston
for half the 20th century, holding elected
ofﬁce, among others, as four-time city mayor
between 1913 and 1950, besides serving
two prison terms on corruption charges.
Admired by working-class Irish families, Curley was noted for his railing against the
Protestant Yankee establishment and for his
rough-and-tumble ways.
Curley used patronage, cash, and rhetoric
to shape his electorate, driving the richer
Protestant citizens out of the city to ensure
his political longevity. Curley’s tools of
patronage were public services, large construction projects, and public employment.
In his ﬁrst year as mayor, Curley raised the
salaries of police patrolmen and school custodians but cut the salaries of higher-ranking
police ofﬁcers and school doctors (Beatty
1992). Miles of sidewalks were laid in Irish
neighborhoods, but the cobblestones of
swank Yankee neighborhoods crumbled
(O’Connor 1995). Boston did not ﬂourish
under Curley: between 1910 and 1950, it had

the lowest population growth rate of any
U.S. city of comparable size.
Glaeser and Shleifer (2002) call this the
“Curley effect”—increasing the size of one’s
political base, or maintaining it, through distortionary, wealth-reducing policies.They use
it to shed light on the ethnic and class politics
of service delivery when the net effect is to
impoverish the overall community.They show
how the Curley effect may apply to Detroit,
USA, to contemporary Zimbabwe, and to the
Labor party in the United Kingdom before its
current reincarnation as New Labor.
The Curley effect demonstrates that
clientelism need not beneﬁt only rich clients.
It can beneﬁt poor clients as well, and still
imply substantial losses in efﬁciency through
the misallocation of public resources. So,
clientelism results in inefﬁcient, targeted allocations that beneﬁt only a few, as opposed to
allocations to universal public services that
beneﬁt larger segments of the same poor
and not-so-poor populations.

politician for building a school or assigning
teachers, but they can less easily verify that
the politician is responsible when the building is maintained or supplied, or when the
teacher is present and competent. If politicians cannot take credit for their efforts to
improve teacher quality, teacher quality is
likely to be low—and voters are unlikely to
expect anything else. In Pakistan nonprofessional considerations have been common in
the placement of teachers.245 The incentives
facing local politicians have been important
factors in the low quality of rural schools
(box 5.3).
In many countries, politicians do not
campaign on their policy record, probity, or
history of program involvement or on the
policy record of their party. Voters then are
likely to believe politicians who have shown
themselves to be reliable sources of personal
assistance. They might be locally inﬂuential
people who have helped families by providing loans or jobs or by resolving bureaucratic difﬁculties. Without well-developed
political parties or national leaders who are
credible, promises of targeted favors are all
that voters can rely on in making electoral
choices.

BOX 5.3

Better to build rural schools than to run them
well in Pakistan

Elected ofﬁcials in Pakistan have demonstrated an extraordinary interest in targeting services to their supporters, but much
less interest in services such as primary education that all voters can enjoy. Contributing to this outcome are three aspects of
rural Pakistani politics: identity-driven politics, voting blocs that make it easy to identify core supporters, and costly elections.
Voter ignorance, poor information on
political competitors, and the absence of
party credibility on broad policy issues
encourage politicians and voters to build
personal relationships that make pre-election promises more credible. Because these
relationships are personal, they tend to be
based on narrow, excludable services
promised and delivered to core supporters.
The distance between rural communities
boosts the political efﬁciency of targeting
political beneﬁts—it is easier to site schools,

roads, and water pipes close to supporters
and far from nonsupporters.
Voting by blocs of supporters makes
patronage a more effective political strategy
than the provision of well-functioning
services that must be provided to all. Costly
elections drive politicians to provide public
services to supporters who can be depended
on to vote for them at low out-of-pocket cost.
Under these conditions, schools may
get built for the corruption, employment,
and proﬁt opportunities that construction
provides.Teachers are hired less on merit
and more on how best to apportion patronage, particularly when absenteeism is not
penalized.There are, in contrast, few
systemic political incentives to make sure
schools run well, teachers remain accountable, and children learn.
Source: World Bank (2002l).

Credibility can make change difﬁcult.
Problems of political credibility can cause
bad policies to become entrenched. Countries often adopt poverty strategies based on
subsidies for consumption and agricultural
production, sometimes at the expense of
broad public services such as education and
health that might have resulted in lower
poverty and more economic growth. India
subsidizes electricity, ostensibly for poor
farmers. Once political credibility is strongly
linked to a particular policy such as delivering subsidized electricity, these policies continue to receive greater public resources than
they would if all political promises were
equally credible. Vested interests develop
around suboptimal policies—rich farmers
capture the power subsidy—which makes
change even more difﬁcult.

Clientelism
Clientelism is characterized by an excessive
tendency for political patrons to provide
private rewards to clients. Politicians allocate public spending to win elections. To do
so, they can provide public goods that can
improve everyone’s welfare (public goods
that are extensive, such as law and order,
universal education, with no rivalry or
excludability). Or they can target localities

(local public goods, projects limited to a
jurisdiction) or individuals and speciﬁc
groups (clientelism).246
What distinguishes clientelism? Clientelism implies a credible threat of exclusion
from a stream of beneﬁts if the voter
chooses to vote for the opposition.247 Thus
an incumbent politician can use clientelism
to deter core supporters from switching
support. Clientelism is hard to pursue for
local or extensive public goods—beneﬁciaries are not reliable clients because they can
support the opposition and still beneﬁt.
The Programa Nacional de Solidaridad
(PRONASOL) poverty alleviation program
in Mexico spent an average of 1.2 percent of
GDP annually on water, electricity, nutrition, and education in poor communities
between 1989 and 1994.248 Municipalities
dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the party in power, received
signiﬁcantly higher per capita transfers than
municipalities that voted in another party
(ﬁgure 5.3). An assessment of PRONASOL
spending suggests that it reduced poverty by
only about 3 percent. Had the budget been
distributed for impact on poverty rather
than party loyalty, the expected decline
would have been 64 percent with perfect targeting, and it would have been 13 percent
even with an untargeted, universal proportional transfer to the whole population. 249
Even if voters want to vote for an opposition party or candidate, they might be
deterred by the fear of being penalized by
the withholding of funds by a central
authority. So voters may end up keeping a
party they may dislike in power in order to
ensure funding for local public services.
This is compounded by a coordination
problem. Even if the majority of localities
wanted to vote against the incumbent party,
without certainty about what other localities planned to do, the majority would end
up supporting the ruling party to avoid
strategic miscoordination and the penalty
of loss of funds.
Clientelism can also be the outcome of
political competition when the credibility
of political competitors is limited—political promises are credible only to “clients.” 250
Politicians with clientelist ties can fulﬁll
campaign promises better than politicians

without them. When only clientelist promises
are credible, promises of construction and
government jobs become the currency of
political competition at the expense of universal access to high-quality education and
health care (as seen in box 5.3). Public works
or jobs can be targeted to individuals and
groups of voters—clear evidence of political
patrons fulﬁlling their promises to clients. It
is much more difﬁcult to target the services of
a well-run village primary school or clinic.
Cross-country evidence on public investment supports the contention that credibility and clientelism signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the provision of public services. There are
no variables that directly capture the credibility of pre-electoral promises or the extent
of clientelism. But it is possible to argue that
in young democracies political competitors
are less likely to be able to make credible
promises to all voters and are more likely to
rely on clientelist promises, and as these
democracies age, politicians are more likely
to increase the number of clients since they
can count on client loyalty. A study summarizing the evidence shows that targeted
spending—public investment—is higher in
young democracies than in old and as
young democracies age, targeted spending
increases.251 Corruption falls as democracies
age. These results are relevant for universal
basic services since they are likely to be of
lower quantity when public investment is
high and of lower quality when corruption
is high. Similar cross-country evidence on
secondary and primary school enrollment
supports the view that credibility is a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the provision of public
services.252

Beyond the ballot box:
citizen initiatives to increase
accountability
When elections are not enough to make services work for poor people, political pressure builds for new approaches that enable
citizens to hold politicians and policymakers more directly accountable for services.
These activities do not replace the electoral
process, but complement it to strengthen
the long route of accountability. The emergence of such citizen initiatives and their

mobilizing potential has been accompanied
by an information revolution that has dramatically simpliﬁed information exchange
and citizen access to ofﬁcial information.
Enthusiasm for direct citizen involvement also comes from mounting frustration
with the dominant mode of a national civil
service delivering services that meet some
technically predetermined “needs” of the
population.253 This frustration has led to
greater interest in directly empowering citizens and overcoming collective action problems, driven also by the ﬁnding that civic
relationships and social capital are important determinants of government efﬁcacy.254

The rapid growth of citizen initiatives has
been described as a new accountability
agenda. It involves “a more direct role for
ordinary people and their associations in
demanding accountability across a more
diverse set of jurisdictions, using an
expanded repertoire of methods, on the
basis of a more exacting standard of social
justice.”255 Citizens are combining electoral
accountability and participation with what
would traditionally have been considered
the ofﬁcial accountability activities of the
state. These initiatives address accountability at various levels. Some are aimed at
strengthening voice in service delivery by
enabling answerability and some at pushing
further for enforceability. These initiatives,
and the state’s response, employ a number
of old and new tools, including tools based
on information technology.
These citizen initiatives cover a far-reaching array of issues, from improving law and
order in Karachi256 to preparing citizen
report cards. They vary tremendously in
scale, ranging from global knowledge-sharing coalitions, such as Shack/Slum Dwellers’
International,257 to community efforts in
Mumbai to monitor arrivals of subsidized
goods at local “fair price” shops in order to
expose fraud in India’s public distribution
system targeted to the poor.258 They also vary
in depth and reach. On election reform, they
range from generating background information on election candidates and their performance in Argentina (Poder Ciudadano259) to
civil society efforts to implement and sustain

an Indian Supreme Court judgment making
it mandatory for all election candidates to
disclose their assets and any criminal record.
On budget analysis, initiatives at one end
seek to make national budgets accessible to
citizens and at the other to promote villagelevel participatory audits of local public
expenditures (box 5.4).
These citizen initiatives also use a broad
range of tools, from door-to-door signature
campaigns to cyber-activism. The rapid
growth of the Internet and communication
technologies has dramatically altered citizen
voice nationally and internationally, though
access is still limited by income and connectivity. Some innovative e-government applications are reducing corruption and delivery
times and increasing service predictability
and convenience. Karnataka, among India’s
leading states in information technology,
has pioneered a computerized land records
system to serve rural households (box 5.5).

Controversy and conﬂict of interest
Two separate trends are discernible in citizen voice initiatives: activities based on consultation, dialogue, and information sharing, and activities more direct and
controversial, related to monitoring, compliance, and auditing. Some activities start
with indirect objectives, build internal
capacity and external trust, and then ven-

BOX 5.4

ture into more difﬁcult areas. The impact of
these initiatives varies according to how
they are perceived by politicians and policymakers and the government’s receptivity to
change. Several studies link this receptivity
to the stock of social capital.260
One concern with some citizen initiatives
is that they can lead to conﬂicts of interest
and reduced accountability to poor people.
Facing funding uncertainties, many nongovernmental organizations seek to diversify,
starting from voice activities but moving on
to actual service delivery. When they become
advocates and providers at the same time,
there can be intrinsic conﬂicts of interest.261
NGOs may suffer from their own lack of
accountability, internal democratic deﬁcits,
and gaps in their mandates.262 The award of
large service delivery contracts to a few big
civil society organizations can exclude and
spell ﬁnancial difﬁculties for smaller organizations.263 And if community and civic
groups are captured by unscrupulous leaders,
they can manipulate funding agencies and
beneﬁciaries for their own gain.264

political promises, and increase the ability of

Follow the public’s money

The budget, a primary statement of government
priorities, is for many citizens a black box, monitored and assessed only by the traditional internal accountability relationships within government. But it can be a crucial tool for citizens to
inﬂuence and monitor public policy and services. Accordingly, participatory budgeting initiatives are increasing rapidly in several countries.The challenge is to build the capacity of
citizen groups, to give politicians and policymakers the incentives to listen and act on citizen feedback, and to put out budgets that are
understandable and interesting to citizens.
Budget planning The most well-known
budget planning initiatives come from city
municipalities in Brazil, such as Porto Alegre and
Belo Horizonte. Neighborhoods indicate their
spending needs at budget forums, and delegates
then bring these needs to assemblies, ensuring

citizen voice in budget allocations and
implementation.
Budget monitoring The Institute for a
Democratic South Africa makes information
about provincial and national budget
allocations accessible to citizens. Its technical
experts break public budgets down to facilitate
public comment. Special reports show how
much money is allocated, say, to gender-related
and children’s issues.The most direct inﬂuence
of its work is in strengthening the ability of
parliamentarians to participate more effectively
in budget discussions.
Budget auditing The Mazdoor Kisan Shakti
Sanghathan (MKSS), a grassroots organization in
the north Indian state of Rajasthan, has turned
ordinary citizens into ﬁnancial auditors. Its key
innovation has been the jan sunwai (or public

hearing), an open-air forum at which ofﬁcial
records are presented alongside the testimony
derived from interviews with local people.
“Many people discovered that they had been
listed as beneﬁciaries of anti-poverty schemes,
though they had never received payment.
Others were astonished to learn of large
payments to local building contractors for work
that was never performed” (Jenkins and Goetz
1999). Until a state right-to-information law was
passed in 2000—largely a result of the protest
and lobbying efforts of the MKSS—its activists
had to obtain this information by appealing to
sympathetic bureaucrats. A similar national law
was passed in 2003.

Down to earth: information technology improves rural service delivery

Karnataka state in India has pioneered Bhoomi
(meaning land), a computerized land record system serving 6.7 million rural clients. Its main
function is to maintain records of rights,
tenancy, and cultivation—crucial for transferring
or inheriting land and obtaining loans. Started
in 1991 as a pilot, the Bhoomi system now has
kiosks in each of the state’s 177 subdistricts, servicing some 30,000 villages.
Under the old system, applicants faced long
delays (3–30 days), and nearly two out of three
clients paid a bribe—70 percent paid more than
Rs. 100 (the ofﬁcial service fee was Rs. 2).There
was little transparency in record maintenance—

the village accountant controlled the process,
with little ofﬁcial or client monitoring. Even
where there was no fraud, the record system
could not easily handle the division of land into
very small lots over generations.
Farmers can now get these records in 5–30
minutes and ﬁle for changes at a Bhoomi kiosk.
The entire process takes place in the vernacular,
Kannada. Clients can watch a second computer
screen facing them as their request is processed.
Users pay a fee of Rs. 15. In a recent evaluation,
only 3 percent of users reported paying a bribe.
The evaluation estimates that on average
Bhoomi annually saves clients 1.32 million work

and policymakers accountable are likely to
improve services for poor people. Conversely,
the lack of transparency in information disclosure can come at a high price. Cases during the earliest phase of the outbreak of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in midNovember 2002 in China were not openly
reported, which allowed a new and severe
disease to become silently established in ways
that made further spread almost inevitable.265
Information campaigns have dramatically
altered the behavior of politicians and policymakers, but many have also failed to induce
change. Understanding when information
campaigns can succeed is thus critical.

What makes for a successful
information strategy?
Tracer studies of spending on Ugandan education revealed leakages as high as 90 percent. Once the information was publicized,
the budgeted resources reaching schools
rose dramatically.266 Studies suggest that
newspaper readership and availability in
India spur state governments to respond to
food crises.267 In Buenos Aires, publishing
the wildly different procurement prices paid
by city hospitals for similar products led to
rapid convergence of prices.268 What did
these information strategies have in common? The information was speciﬁc. Political
interest in addressing the problem was high.
And the information was electorally salient.
Speciﬁc information. The information
identiﬁed speciﬁc government decisions, speciﬁc decisionmakers, and the effect of the
decision on the voters individually or as a

The resistance of village accountants had to
be overcome in implementing Bhoomi.The
chief minister, revenue minister, and members of
the legislature championed Bhoomi, which
helped.There are now plans to expand beyond
land transactions.The Indian government has
suggested that other states consider similar systems to improve accountability and efﬁciency in
services that are vital to rural households.

group. That made benchmarking—systematic comparisons across time or space—easy.
The Uganda information was not about the
general quality of education or general budget
support, or even about leakage from national
education budgets. It was about one type of
transfer—capitation grants—disaggregated
to the school level, responsibility for which
was easy for parents and voters to assign to the
school principal. In addition, the information
made clear to voters what the school should
have received. The information in Buenos
Aires was also speciﬁc to individual hospitals.
Government responses to food crises
show how the provision of high-level information is politically enforceable by voters.
First, a food crisis is a single, speciﬁc issue.
Second, responsibility for it is known to rest
ultimately in the state chief minister’s ofﬁce.
Third, there are no complicated issues of
quality measurement—voters know immediately that they are beneﬁting if they receive
assistance. Benchmarking is a bit more complicated but still doable. Voters know if others less deserving receive assistance. But they
do not know what effort governments
should make in responding to food crises
(which is different from the benchmarks in
the Uganda tracer studies, where voters
knew exactly how much money should have
reached individual schools).269
Strong political or bureaucratic interest in
correcting the problem. In some cases
(Uganda and possibly Buenos Aires),
national politicians did not beneﬁt, and
potentially lost, from leakages or inefﬁciencies. That is, corruption was the product of

bureaucratic shirking rather than political
rent-seeking. Education had become a
major issue for the president of Uganda,
and his reputation was on the line. He had
made public promises, followed by the
highly visible action of transferring more
funds to local schools. His ability to fulﬁll
those promises was being undermined by
bureaucratic malfeasance. Once the malfeasance was revealed, the fear of sanctions was
enough to hold individual bureaucrats
accountable and produce rapid change.
In other cases, such as assistance in a
food crisis, there is considerably more room
for shirking. Citizens ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
know how large the crisis is, what resources
are available, and how efﬁciently and equitably the resources are distributed. This
uncertainty leaves room for political inaction. But the consequences of government
inaction—starvation deaths and their
reports in the media—are grave enough to
tarnish the chief executive’s reputation,
which gives the state administration a
major reason to avoid them. Famines do
not occur in democratic countries, even
very poor ones, because the survival of the
government would be threatened by the
opposition and by newspapers and other
media.270 And the more citizens are
informed about the crisis and the needed
response, the more likely they are to hold
politicians electorally accountable.
The issue is important electorally. Politicians are not interested in improving performance if voters do not care. Voters can be
well informed and know who the responsible politician is, but still not hold the politician accountable because other issues loom
larger. Where conﬂict is rife, or society is
polarized, the politician’s stance on conﬂict
or polarization may dominate voter attention, allowing the politician to get away with
poor performance on other issues. In
Uganda, the president made education a
central part of his election manifesto. In
Buenos Aires, municipal politicians may
have been concerned that voters would view
the corruption in hospitals as indicative of
deeper problems of malfeasance, in the city
government and, because Buenos Aires is
the capital, in other cities and the country.

Citizen report cards:
information as political action
Other information strategies look directly at
public service outputs (quality and quantity
of services provided by government) rather
than inputs (prices paid, budgets committed
and delivered). The best known are the citizen report cards developed by the Public
Affairs Centre in Bangalore, India.271 Citizens are asked to rate service access and quality and to report on corruption and general
grievances about public services. Citizen
report cards have spread to cities in the
Philippines, Ukraine, and, on a pilot basis,
Vietnam. They have recently been scaled up
in India to cover urban and rural services in
24 states.272 The results have stimulated considerable media, bureaucratic, and political
attention and acknowledgment of their contribution to service improvements.
Because citizen report cards focus on service outcomes, they do not provide voters with
information about speciﬁc decisions that speciﬁc policymakers have made—or not made.
Nor do they give voters information (at least in
their ﬁrst round) about service benchmarks,
except to the extent that the agencies themselves have established service standards
(repeat report cards do provide implicit benchmarks from the previous report card). So it can
be hard for voters to assess, on the basis of one
report card, whether the results justify voting
against the incumbents at the next election.
Report cards seem to have had a more
direct inﬂuence on the heads and senior managers of the municipal and utility agencies
responsible for services, as in Bangalore. The
high visibility of report cards in the press and
civic forums turns them into league tables of
the efﬁcacy of municipal agencies. The reputational competition arising from the report
cards is enhanced by joint agency meetings on
the report cards attended by prominent social
and political leaders and citizens.
But report cards clearly also perform a
political function. Politicians can ignore poor
public services if they believe that voters cannot penalize them for poor performance. Or if
they believe that a political challenger cannot
credibly promise voters better performance.
An NGO conducting broad surveys and issuing report cards on public services changes
the equation. Now incumbent politicians are

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

11_WDR_Ch05.qxd 8/14/03 8:40 AM Page 89

Citizens and politicians

confronted by an organized effort to improve
public service delivery, which creates a latent
political force that is credible because there is
no obvious personal gain to members of the
NGO. The information that the NGO generates and disseminates is a political challenge,
both because of the demonstrated underlying
ability to mobilize citizens to answer a survey
and the power of that information in the
hands of informed voters.

Some implications
for information strategies
These examples show that pure information
strategies work in fairly speciﬁc circumstances. But many information strategies are
not designed around the speciﬁcs of a particular country or service. Information about
broad aggregates of public sector performance—whether based on surveys, budget
studies, or other methods—is less likely to be
as politically relevant. Why? Because it does
not provide voters with a sense of how their
representatives in government have hurt or
helped them.
Like report cards, such information can
still be useful if voters can benchmark the
information or if the very collection of the
information implies some latent political
organization that could challenge incumbents. But in many cases, the information
collected is one-off—collected by donors and
other foreign entities (posing no political
threat by deﬁnition), by local survey ﬁrms
(with no speciﬁc interest in social services),
or by civil society organizations (which care
deeply about public service performance but
play no electoral role).
At the end of the day, these efforts tell citizens what they already know—that services
are bad. They might tell them exactly how bad
and which services are worse than others—
roughly the information citizens already had,
but more quantiﬁed. What citizens do not
have, and what they need help in getting, is
information about how bad their neighborhood’s services are relative to others’ and who
is responsible for the difference.273 In these
cases outsiders can help in several ways:

•

Supporting civil society organizations
that generate and use speciﬁc information about service delivery.

•
•

Supporting civil society organizations that
show how to mobilize citizens and be a
credible voice for public service provision.
Supporting mass media development.
First, improving the media’s ability to ask
the right questions (reporting on whether
government policy succeeds or fails,
including how to identify the correct
benchmarks). Second, improving the
media’s credibility (independence from
private interests that beneﬁt from government largesse and from government inﬂuence, advertising revenue, or ownership).
Reducing barriers to entry is key here.
Third, improving interaction with civil
society to generate information that reveals
public malfeasance or nonfeasance.274

Decentralization
to strengthen voice
Decentralizing delivery responsibilities for
public services is prominent on the reform
agenda in many developing countries (see
chapter 10). Bolivia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria,
Pakistan, and South Africa—to name a few—
are all part of a worldwide movement to
decentralize. A key objective, usually linked to
the political motivation for decentralization, is
to strengthen citizen voice by bringing services
and elected politicians closer to the client.

Decentralization of service delivery
to local governments
Experience with decentralization varies. In
Bolivia the creation of rural local governments has been associated with dramatic
shifts in public allocations away from infrastructure and into the social sectors—and a
sharp fall in the geographic concentration
of public investments as they get more
evenly dispersed across regions.275 But others have been less lucky, with increased
regional inequalities and the capture of
public resources by local elites. Since several
major decentralization reforms are just
beginning (Indonesia, Pakistan), there is a
tremendous opportunity to rigorously evaluate the impact of different institutional
designs on the quality of public goods.
What does it take for political decentralization to improve universal, basic social
services? Two conditions. First, voters must
be more likely to use information about the

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

89

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

quality of local public goods in making
their voting decisions. Second, local political promises to voters must be more credible than regional or national promises.
In principle, the impact of decentralization
on informed voting and political credibility
could go either way. On the one hand, voters
may make more use of information about
local public goods in their voting decisions
because such information is easier to come by
and outcomes are more directly affected by
local government actions. And political agents
may have greater credibility because of proximity to the community and reputations
developed through social interaction over an
extended period. On the other hand, local
voters may be apathetic about local elections
and have little or no information about the
resource availability and capabilities of local
governments. Social polarization may be
more intense because of age-old differences
across settled communities. With closer social
relations between elected representatives and
their clients, clientelist promises to a few voters may be easier to make and fulﬁll.

Managerial decentralization
and political credibility
There has also been a push for institutionalizing greater autonomy of decisionmaking in
schools, hospitals, and clinics—and encouraging greater participation of citizens
through parent-teacher associations and
health committees. These institutional interventions are also likely to address the credibility of elected politicians. Politicians located at
the center far from the communities where
services are delivered cannot credibly
promise to improve service quality in such
transaction-intensive services as basic health
and education. At most they can commit only
to providing such veriﬁable elements as infrastructure, equipment, and salaries.
When responsibility for delivering and
monitoring primary education is completely
centralized, the political incentives for
improving the quality of schooling are weak.
But if monitoring of providers is decentralized (to clients), voters need verify only that
politicians have made resources available for
schools and clinics to decide whether to
reward or punish them at election time, and
politicians then can be more credible.

Citizen voice in eight
sizes
Whether a political system is pro-poor or
clientelist is difﬁcult to assess and address.
This is obviously the case for outside actors
such as donors, but also for those within a
country, who are naturally inﬂuenced by the
history and traditions of their particular political system, such as parliamentary democracy.
But the payoffs in service delivery for assessing
whether the environment is pro-poor or
clientelist can be high. Even if the politics are
clientelist, policy choices can be made that are
likely to yield better results than the misguided application of policies that work well
only in pro-poor environments.
Such choices can be combined with considerations of whether preferences are
homogeneous or heterogeneous (a feature
of the relationship between clients and
providers, discussed in chapter 4), and
whether services are easy or hard to monitor
by policymakers (and therefore whether contracts between policymakers and providers
can be written, as noted in chapter 3 and discussed in more detail in chapter 6). Simply
put, the more people differ in their preferences, the more the decisions about service
delivery should be decentralized. The harder
it is for policymakers to monitor, the more
clients need to be involved and the stronger
client power must be.
Different combinations of these characteristics lead to different choices, some a better ﬁt
than others, so that while no one size ﬁts all,
for illustrative purposes perhaps eight sizes
might (ﬁgure 5.4). None of these characteristics or choices can be precisely rendered
because countries lie on a continuum. But
understanding them can help in thinking
about the arrangements that are the most
likely to make services work for poor people.
Figure 5.4 also illustrates the broad service
delivery arrangements and the implied policy
choices that are appropriate under different
settings. The biggest problem? The appropriate choice is often not made.
In many countries, policymakers assume
that for transaction-intensive and hard-tomonitor services (for example, primary education), their country or region has pro-poor
politics and little heterogeneity of preferences.
So they chose central government provision

3 Deconcentrated government or local provision or contracting out. Deconcentrated central government
may have an advantage over local government—at least in terms of financing—since service is easy
to monitor and central government is in a better position to achieve interregional transfers of income.
4 Local or deconcentrated government provision. Lower-tier and local governments may have advantage
over central government because they are better able to monitor local service quality and can be more
easily held accountable.
5 Contracted provision and public financing that provides lots of information to strengthen voice and
client power. Clientelist relationships dominate politics. Services used as currency of political
patronage. Politicians have strong incentives for providing narrowly targeted transfers rather than
universal public goods and prefer credibility that clientelism yields. Information about politicians,
their specific contributions, and service inputs and outputs can strengthen voice and have high payoff
and be cost-effective. Scorecards, tracking surveys, and client satisfaction surveys potentially most
useful since nature of service and preferences are uniform and easy to monitor and compare across
jurisdictions. Public disclosure and a free press essential. Strengthen voice and client power in
general to counter clientelism (applies to 5–8).
6 Encourage altruistic providers (NGOs). Copayments and fees to reduce capture. Public information
campaigns.

Rule-based allocations, copayments, user groups, altruistic NGOs, information for mobilizing clients.
Free press essential to monitor compliance.

(option 2 in ﬁgure 5.4). But if the service
delivery environment is actually based on
clientelism, and preferences vary widely, then
conditions have been misread and services
fail poor people. Decentralized provision
with lots of client involvement at all levels
may be called for in ways that create choice
and mimic the market if services are to work
(option 8).
In general, services can be made to work
in clientelist settings by choosing arrangements that reduce the rents from service
delivery that would otherwise be captured
through patronage and clientelism. These
are the situations depicted in options 5
through 8. The appropriate service arrangement for hard-to-monitor services such as
curative care or primary education might
then be option 6 or 8 depending on whether
preferences are homogenous or heterogeneous. If institutional arrangements change

and a pro-poor service delivery environment emerges, it should be possible to move
to the service arrangements described in
options 1 through 4. But to the extent they
do not change, then trying to scale up with
options 1 through 4 and make services work
for poor people may be wishful thinking
and a waste of resources.
Under either clientelist or pro-poor environments, having more and better information pays off in strengthening voice. Information about services that is speciﬁc, directly
related to voters’ concerns, and framed in a
way that ensures political interest in addressing service delivery concerns is likely to be the
most effective. Information from impact
assessments can show what works and why.
Information about politicians can boost their
political credibility, strengthen incentives to
provide universal public services, and avoid
politically targeted goods and rent-seeking.

spotlight on

the Kecamatan Development Program

Choice, participation, and transparency in Indonesian villages
A new generation of community development projects in Indonesia illustrates many of the key elements of effective
services. The projects transfer resources directly to local control, allowing a local decisionmaking body to choose among
proposals from community groups. The three principles are: choice, participation, and transparency.

Pastoral scene—or chaotic mess
Indonesia in the New Order era of Soeharto
(1967–98) has been compared to a French
Impressionist painting: viewed from a distance, a beautiful pastoral scene, but viewed
closely, a chaotic mess.
The government launched top-down
“blueprint” development programs in fertility, health, schooling, and poverty reduction—implemented by a reasonably functional and capable bureaucracy. Viewed in
the aggregate, the results were spectacular.
Gross domestic product per capita grew at
more than 5 percent a year. Poverty fell from
nearly half the population in the 1970s to 11
percent in 1997. Infant mortality fell, fertility fell, and schooling rose dramatically.
The 1979 law establishing village governments was state of the art—on paper. With
the goals of “decentralization” and “bottomup” planning, the law established locally
chosen village heads accountable to a village
council. The budget planning process incorporated village-level meetings to elicit bottom-up inputs into budget priorities.
But the reality of village leadership was
different. Creating multifunctional village
administrative structures imposed order
and uniformity at odds with existing social
structures, ignoring organizations with speciﬁc functions (water) and traditional leadership (adat).276 Many villages had dynamic
leaders, but many others had leaders chosen
essentially by the regional (province or district) government, which had veto power
over candidates.277 The village head was
accountable to a council, but he also headed
the council and chose many of its members.
Most village heads were accountable
upward—to regional governments—and
not to the villagers. The bottom-up planning never really functioned: one analysis of
770 village proposals found that, at most, 3
percent were included in district budgets.278
Empirical results from a recent survey in
48 rural villages suggest that the government-driven organizations did not make
village governance more responsive. Those

who reported participating in the government-organized village groups reported
being more likely to have spoken out about
village problems and to have done so effectively. But this impact, by crowding out the
voice of others in the village, appears to
have been negative overall.
The problems with local governance
were obvious in projects. The ﬁrst-generation poverty alleviation programs—block
grants to poor communities, under the IDT
(Impres Desa Tertinggal)—used existing
village structures and were judged to have
had very little impact, in quantity or quality.279 A study of all projects in villages—
including those initiated by villages on their
own(found that village-initiated projects
were much more likely to have sustained
beneﬁts than government-initiated projects
(ﬁgure 1).
The next generation of more participatory projects—two rounds of village infrastructure projects and water supply and
sanitation projects—showed that greater
community engagement could have real
payoffs. Water projects designed to incorporate participation had much lower failure
rates than conventional projects. And the
costs of the village infrastructure projects
were 30 to 50 percent lower than costs in
projects using government construction.

Scaling up with simplicity and trust

Figure 1 Community-initiated projects: more
likely to be maintained and in full use

•

Simplicity meant that funds were
released directly to communities, eliminating one role for regional (district and
provincial) governments.

•

Participation was encouraged, and
locally chosen village and subdistrict
facilitators helped groups to prepare
proposals and encouraged the dissemination of information.

•

Self-reliance reversed the usual dependence of villagers on technical staff from
ministries and government, permitting
villagers to hire the engineers and other
technical help.

The ﬁnancial and political crises that
began in 1997 opened a window for
action. Projects were desperately needed
to help rural areas quickly. An improved
design for community projects—based on
the lessons of block grants under the IDT
and infrastructure investments under village infrastructure projects—was being
piloted. It included open menus and more
emphasis on community participation
and decisionmaking. The crisis also created an opportunity to act on issues of
transparency, local accountability, and
corruption.
The new Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) provides block grants to eligible subdistricts—or kecamatan, an administrative unit that includes roughly 10 to
20 villages and roughly 30,000 people,
though its size varies enormously. Each
subdistrict uses the funds to ﬁnance community proposals from the villages for
small-scale public goods (roads, wells,
bridges) or economic activities. Making
the decisions about which proposals to
fund is a subdistrict forum, including village delegations.
The KDP’s design was based on simplicity, participation, self-reliance, transparency,
and trust. These principles may sound platitudinous, but they pushed the design envelope in several directions.

Spotlight on the Kecamatan Development Program

•

Transparency meant that all ﬁnancial
information was publicly available, and
detailed information about the use of
the funds was available in each village in
simple and easy-to-understand formats.

•

Trust made it possible to move from
complicated formal accounting systems
for releasing funds to disbursement systems that rely on minimal documentation—but with built-in checks and
oversight.

The project has so far been an implementation success, scaled up from 40 villages in 1998 to more than 15,000 in 2002.
It has moved into another cycle and been
replicated in urban areas. Evaluation
efforts, including an innovative attempt to
directly measure the impact on corruption,
are examining whether the KDP has
improved project performance.
This is not to suggest that the KDP is
free from ﬂaws—it is a transitional project
in a transitional situation, embedded in
existing institutions. There have been problems of corruption and poor technical
quality, and problems of local leaders “guiding” the participatory decisionmaking. But
the KDP does give villagers the structured
mechanisms of decisionmaking and transparency. It also gives them recourse to force
the issue of better governance. Corrupt ofﬁcials have been sued. Money has been
recovered. Decisions have been reversed.
Two lingering issues: First, is the KDP an
idiosyncratic product of its particular time
and place—or a model that can be replicated
elsewhere? That versions of it are being
launched in Afghanistan and the Philippines

93

(and perhaps elsewhere) suggests the latter.
But whether it will “work” in those places is
still an open question. Perhaps the principles
can be implemented with the design adapted
to local circumstances.
Second, are large external agencies (like
the World Bank) really capable of supporting “big-time small development” projects?
Perhaps yes, perhaps no. Some argue that
external actors have no mandate or expertise for engaging in local governance. And
preserving the traditional exclusive link of
external agencies to formal public provider
organizations may make them incapable of
contributing to the creation of needed local
accountabilities.

community-driven project design because
it can undermine technical quality. Given
the choice of a participatory bridge or an
engineered bridge, most people would cross
the engineered bridge. The question is how
to create a well-engineered bridge that
responds to community needs. Other services try to balance community control and
technical quality: participation in health
care does not mean that medical science
can be replaced. Should KDP-like mechanisms be expanded with improved links to
technical providers? Or should technical
providers be strengthened and the “participatory” role be channeled not into direct
control and decisionmaking but into electing local ofﬁcials?

This or that? Three strategic choices

Local or regional governments. Regional
governments often complain that moving
resources directly to communities undermines their authority, slowing the capacity
building needed for formal governance and
democracy. Proponents of community
development respond that deep democracy
depends on the kinds of transparency, decisionmaking, open debate, and accountability that community projects build. Decentralizing decisions about budgets and
programs to the provincial level—when
people have not developed traditions and
institutions of civic decisionmaking at the
local level (or have had them suppressed)—
is risky business. In a transitional environment, periodic elections alone are unlikely
to be sufﬁcient for public accountability.
The development of nonelectoral mechanisms of public accountability (transparency, legal recourses, direct participation) is key.

Community-driven development projects
such as the KDP raise three strategic
choices relevant to the design of service
delivery.
Narrow or sharp targeting. Community
funds, it is often alleged, are captured by
“elites” and will not be well targeted to the
poor. The KDP shows that the poor do beneﬁt, but it is difﬁcult to reach the poorest of
the poor or to change deeply held social
prejudices simply by project design
(despite, for example, KDP mechanisms to
enhance women’s voice). Few large programs have shown greater ability to target
the poor, and the very narrowly targeted
programs would not elicit engagement and

spotlight on

Norway and Estonia

Developing social services and building a nation
One of the richest countries in the world, Norway today is the quintessential welfare state, with universal access to basic
health and education. But this welfare state evolved over two centuries, with private systems only gradually giving way to
state-run institutions. Making social services available to all was seen as part of building the Norwegian nation. Though
geographically close, Estonia regained its independence in 1991. It is seeking to develop its social services and build a
nation in a much shorter time, and under budgetary constraints.

Norway: gradual change with topdown pressure
In 1860 the Norwegian national assembly
passed two laws—the Health Act and the
School Act—the ﬁrst time the state took
responsibility for the health and education of
its people. The Health Act, which established
health commissions in every municipality,
was promoted by the country’s social elite to
improve the welfare of Norway’s farming and
peasant communities so that the country
could compete with the more advanced
nations of Europe. The elite saw educating
poor rural households in personal and environmental hygiene as a key to this project,
and the health commissions were charged
with this task. Interestingly, members of the
medical profession, which up to that point
had a somewhat lower status than other professions (lawyers, priests, and the military),
saw themselves as the natural leaders of the
campaign. According to one doctor, appointing a lawyer to head the campaign (something that was being contemplated) “would
do nothing to further the cause.”280
But the health commissions faced signiﬁcant difﬁculties in getting their job
done. In addition to the facts that doctors
were not trained in public health and their
work was poorly paid, the cultural divide
between the urban elites and rural farmers
was an obstacle. For instance, although fertilizer was a scarce commodity, the doctors
were trying to get rid of the compost heaps
near people’s houses because of the “rotten”
air that people were obliged to breathe.
Meanwhile, many of the services were
being delivered by grassroots organizations.
Founded in 1896, the Norwegian Women’s
Public Health Association was running 14
sanatoria for patients with tuberculosis by
1920. The Association also advocated for
greater public intervention in health, getting
the authorities to open public baths and regu-

larly monitor the health of infants and
schoolchildren. From 1890 onwards, the
health sector evolved through public-private
partnerships, spurred on by pressure from
grassroots and philanthropic organizations.
As the state took on more responsibility for
delivering universal services, a process that
picked up in the 1930s, it did not have to build
the institutions from scratch: it could build on
institutions already built, organized, and
ﬁnanced by private actors and civil society.

Reforming schools
From 1739, children were required to
attend school from the age of seven until
they could read and undergo Lutheran conﬁrmation. The incentives to learn to read
were strong. No reading meant no conﬁrmation, and no conﬁrmation meant no
marriage license, no land holding, no permanent job, and no chance of enlisting in
the armed forces. Nevertheless, the rural
population resisted sending their children
to school, mainly because they found the
curriculum irrelevant for farming.
As with health, formally trained teachers
became the driving force behind using education to build the Norwegian nation.
Teachers organized themselves in 1848 and
advocated inclusion of education professionals in policymaking bodies. The School
Act of 1860 shifted responsibility for running schools from the clergy to an elected
school board (whose head would still be a
priest). As a result of populist and agrarian
pressure, local school councils were able to
appoint teachers, determine their own
“education plan,” and introduce New Norse
as the language of instruction. But a growing labor movement was demanding more
universal education, so that by 1889 a common school law was passed and education
ﬁnally moved from religious training to
general learning and nation building.

Estonia: starting over, with few
resources
At re-independence in 1991, Estonia wanted
to move away from its inherited systems to
modern Western European approaches that
rested on progressive governmental, economic, and social reforms—partly for acceptance into the European Union. The new
state had to quickly establish the mechanisms
of a modern welfare system. But there was little time to establish the system’s legitimacy.
The ﬁrst priority in 1991 was services
based on Estonian language and culture,
critical for national identity. Then came the
urgent need to improve efﬁciency and
equity. But economic difﬁculties limited the
resources for reform.
The health care system had to be completely reorganized. Unlike the situation in
Norway, the administrative, legislative, and
regulatory powers in Estonia were all in one
place: the Ministry of Health. With little
transparency and control, corruption ﬂourished.
To address the problem, the old statefunded system was replaced by health
insurance, which facilitated transparency
and a steady stream of ﬁnance. A major
challenge has been to convey the logic and
long-term advantages of the new system.
People suddenly had to pay for health care
that used to be free. Drugs were sold at
European prices. And, although the system
has equity as a goal, the health status of a
growing number of Estonians is declining,
especially that of the elderly, ethnic minorities, and the unemployed. Around 6 percent
of the population is not yet covered by the
new national health insurance system.
On many accounts, Estonia has succeeded more than many other newly independent countries. But in seeking to ﬁnd its
own way of making services work, it has not
had the luxury of time.

chapter

Educated children. Good health. Clean, reliable, and convenient water. Safe neighborhoods. Lighted homes. That is what citizens, poor and rich, want from services. If
policymakers take responsibility for delivering services, they must also care about these
outcomes and be sure that services
providers care about them, too. Chapter 5
discussed the ﬁrst challenge: inducing policymakers to reﬂect the interests of poor
people. This chapter takes up the second:
inducing providers to achieve the outcomes
of interest to poor people. How? By choosing appropriate providers. By aligning
incentives with those outcomes. And by
ensuring that policymakers do at least as
well as the clients themselves in creating
those incentives.

Compacts, management, and the
“long route” of accountability
The “compact” introduced in chapter 3 is
composed of relationships of accountability
necessary for increasing the power of incentives for good performance (ﬁgure 6.1).

be clear and backed with sufﬁcient resources
for adequate and regular compensation.
Good information on the actions of
providers and the outcomes of those actions
must get to the policymaker. And remuneration must be tied as closely to these outcomes
as possible. Accountability is improved by:

•

•

•

Clarifying responsibilities—by separating the role of policymaker, accountable
to poor citizens, from that of provider
organizations, accountable to policymakers.
Choosing the appropriate provider—
civil servants, autonomous public agencies, NGOs, or private contractors. Competition can often help in this choice.
Providing good information—an essential step. Just monitoring the performance
of contracts requires more and better
measures. Keeping an eye on the prize of
better outcomes also requires more regular measurement. It also requires ﬁnding
out what works by rigorously evaluating
programs and their effects.

These steps are neither easy nor straightforward. Political pressures often make it
impossible for policymakers to claim independence from the performance of service
providers. Compacts for the kind of services
discussed here cannot be complete or have
perfectly measured outcomes. Finding
enough staff, regardless of their precise
employment agreements, is a real challenge
for many developing countries because of
international migration and, for Sub-Saharan
Africa, HIV/AIDS. And ﬁnding out what
works—determining the link between policies and inputs and outcomes—is difﬁcult,
not just for technical reasons. Governments,
donors, and provider organizations fre95

quently don’t want to know—or don’t want
to take the risk of ﬁnding out—what doesn’t work.281
It may be difﬁcult to measure the outcomes of health, education, and infrastructure services, but it is possible. Improvements cannot be measured as precisely as
tons of steel. But the outcomes of these services are far more amenable to measurement
than many core functions of government.
Mortality rates, literacy rates, and the purity
of water are observable in ways that “advancing the international interests of the nation,”
the goal of a foreign ministry for example,
are not.282 And technical knowledge for
rigorous evaluation of programs to reach
the poor is certainly available.
A word on “compacts” versus “management.” The focus of this chapter is the compact between the policymaker and the
provider organizations, not the details of the
management of frontline providers by a
provider organization. Appropriate management needs to be tailored to local circumstances. Focusing on the details of management detracts from the more crucial
relationship of the compact and indulges the
tendency to micromanage. Here the emphasis is on the principles for designing incentives. But management cannot be ignored
entirely. Much of the (very thin) literature on
what works and what doesn’t—on provider
responses to changes in incentives—deals
with management reforms, so these experiences must form the limited empirical base.

Misaligned incentives
and service failures
Failures to reach poor people with effective
services can usually be attributed to a misalignment between the incentives facing
providers and outcomes. A private market
left to itself cannot provide appropriate services to poor people. It will tend to serve
clients who possess the purchasing power for
a fairly narrow set of services. Modern, private medical care by skilled professionals and
private education are largely used by the better off. Water is an exception, with substantial
middle-class capture of public water, leaving
poor people to buy from expensive private
sellers. The range of services the private sector will provide on its own is limited to, well,

private goods. Private providers may be contracted by the public sector for services to
poor people or for true public goods (where a
private sector is impossible, even in principle). But they cannot be relied on to provide
them on their own. That is why the public
sector should assume responsibility for basic
services, especially for poor people.
The public sector has its problems, too.
Chapter 5 asked whether, in fulﬁlling this
responsibility, policymakers have the incentive to “do the right thing.” The answer is
often “no.” But even if policies are properly
designed, it is difﬁcult to get personnel to
staff facilities in poor or remote areas.
Vacancy rates for doctors in Indonesia range
from near zero in Bali to as high as 60 percent
in West Papua (formerly Irian Jaya), the
province farthest from Java (box 6.1).
The difﬁculty in stafﬁng such places varies
by job. It is greatest for the most highly educated people with the best alternative
employment prospects. Educated people in
countries with few such people are almost
always urban born and bred. In Niger 43 percent of the parents of nurses and midwives
were civil servants, and 70 percent of them

central Kalimantan more than 40 percent.

had been raised in the city.283 It is only natural for them to want the same for their children. And it is naïve to simply say “pay them
more.” Doctors in Indonesia would require
multiples of current pay levels to live in West
Papua.284 And giving providers too much discretion over where they serve may hurt the
poor, as in rural schools in Zambia (box 6.2).
Even when people accept jobs in poor
areas, their absenteeism is often astonishing
(see tables 1.2 and 1.3 in chapter 1). The reasons vary, but alternative earning opportunities are a major one for professions with
easily marketable skills.285 This applies to
doctors and other medical personnel and to
teachers offering independent tutoring.
Again, the day-to-day imperatives for people
to make a living run counter to increasing
services to poor people. This is particularly
true where civil service pay is much less
than private sector pay for the same skills.
Even when people are on the job, their
performance can compromise the outcomes

for poor people. The lack of conscientiousness, the mistreatment of students and
patients, and the loss of skills with time
(chapter 1)—all can be attributed to a combination of the failure of incentives and a
service ethos. Salaried workers with no
opportunity to advance and no fear of punishment have little incentive to perform well.
Chapter 4 argued that discourtesy depended
on incentives, not training. If income does
not come from clients, the policymaker must
hold providers accountable, particularly in
monitoring and rewarding good behavior.
Corruption—unauthorized private gain
from public resources—is common in many
services and also attributable to competing
incentives. In Eastern Europe under-the-table
payments to public servants and general corruption undermine the legitimacy of all government services. They are particularly costly
to poor people (box 6.3). Pharmaceutical
mismanagement is everywhere: thefts from
public stores supply much of the private market in Côte d’Ivoire, India, Jordan, Thailand,
and Zambia. Corruption responds to monetary incentives, but it also requires a lack of
information on hidden activities and an
inability to impose sanctions. As Captain
Shotover in George Bernard Shaw’s Heartbreak House put it,“Give me deeper darkness.
Money is not made in the light.” Open information can reduce both the incidence of corruption and its corrosiveness.286
Community pressure can also subvert
the incentives to fulﬁll the primary responsibilities of public providers. In many places
the public servant is a permanent member
of the community, facing substantial social
pressures to bend rules to the beneﬁt of
local preferences. Sometimes this is good—
it shows the ﬂexibility to respond to local
needs. But for some services, particularly
those with punitive characteristics, it can
compromise the core duties of the provider.
For example, forestry agents who are part of
a community may be reluctant to report
illegal logging by their neighbors.287 A form
of community pressure particularly harmful to the poor is the capture of services by
local elites. In Northern Ghana young, inexperienced, and poorly paid facilitators for
participatory projects found such pressure a
major impediment.288

Bribery hurts the poor

To gain access to health, education, and the justice system in Kazakhstan, poor people pay bribes simply to
receive services they are entitled to (and to avoid “problems” getting them) while richer people pay to speed
up service.
In Romania, the poor pay substantially higher fractions of income in bribes.

Many, and usually most, providers in the
public sector are dedicated people whose
interests are largely compatible with the public good. But their own needs of looking after
a family, ensuring their well being, having
friendly relations with neighbors—all prevent them from providing sufﬁcient services
to beneﬁt poor people. If the scale of operations needs to be increased to reach the poor,
even more incentives need to be changed at
the margin, whether monetary or not.289

Increasing accountability:
separating the policymaker
from the provider
The many incentives that providers face blur
the focus on outcomes. Making a clear separation between the role of the policymaker
and the provider organization is essential for
aligning the incentives for the provider with
the ﬁnal outcomes that policymakers want
for citizens. Who is the policymaker, and who
is the provider organization? The policymaker is the person directly accountable to
the citizenry, preferably the poorer citizenry.
And the provider organization is responsible

for delivering services. In many cases, the policymaker is the legislature or a central ministry, the provider organization a line ministry. So many of the activities of the head of
the “provider organization” will look like policymaking. But these are “internal policies” of
the organization to achieve the overall goals
focused on here. (The literature on public
management explicitly cautions against separating290 policymaking from implementation, but that literature is concerned with
management within the “provider organization” and not the separation proposed here.)
Clear separation lends itself to much simpler and less ambiguous accountability for
the provider organization. When the policymaker is the provider organization, day-today pressures of management compromise
attention to outcomes on the ground. Take
the desire to ﬁnd and ﬁx problems (see the
spotlight on Johannesburg). When the policymaker takes a separate role from the
provider, it is easier to say “I don’t care what
your problem is, just tell me the vaccination
rates. Or the test scores. Or crime rates.”
When roles are mixed, bureaucracies become
insular and tend to hide mistakes.

Policymakers and providers

Is this separation really necessary? Is it
achieved in rich countries? Education, for
example, is frequently administered through
central ministries, which employ all teachers
directly with little monitoring from central
staff agencies (such as ﬁnance). Perhaps separation is not necessary for successful services.
But rich countries beneﬁt from a long
evolution of the relationships between the
state and frontline providers. Almost all services provided directly to individuals in the
now-rich countries were originally provided
privately. They were eventually absorbed or
consolidated by a state institution that had
been separate from the existing provider
organizations. The state began as an independent outside monitor and regulator of private
activities. It largely retained that independence as a monitor after the same activities
became public (box 6.4).
For the developing world the desire for
rapid expansion of public ﬁnancing and provision short-circuits this historical development. Both the monitoring and the provision
are taking place simultaneously. This is not
necessarily a bad thing—the poor might otherwise have to wait much longer for services
to reach them. But it does show that the current institutional features of rich countries
may not transfer directly to poor countries
without the establishment of a complementary regulatory structure, a structure that may
need to be established beforehand. Without
this structure progress may be slow—possibly slower than if a not-for-proﬁt or private
sector were allowed to develop and later
brought under the supervisory wing of the
government.
Separating the policymaker from the
provider organization also helps to increase
the accountability of providers. But if the policymaker knows what services to deliver, why
can’t providers just be given instructions—in a
contract—to do them? That is, why can’t outputs just be speciﬁed and paid for accordingly?

Limits to accountability
All public services face three problems that
make this solution impossible: providers
face multiple principals, undertake multiple
tasks, and produce outcomes that are hard
to observe and hard to attribute to their
actions.291

Multiple principals
The instructions of the policymaker to
providers are not the only ones that count.
Public servants have to serve many masters.
Education providers are under pressure
from parents of poor children (with the
policymaker representing them), parents of
children other than the poor, teachers’
unions, potential employers, various groups
in society that want (or don’t want) particular items on the curriculum, and others.
Power and water providers are under pressure from different segments of the market
to cross-subsidize them, from producers to
buy speciﬁc types of equipment, from people who want more extensive connections,
and from others who want more reliable,
continuous operation. The day-to-day pressure of local demand for health care can
compromise efforts in disease prevention
and other public health activities that are
not demand-driven.292 Whom is a provider
to listen to?

BOX 6.4

Learning to regulate

Although the state pays for health care in
most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries,
private practitioners still provide it (exceptions on the ﬁnance side include the United
States; exceptions on the provision side, the
United Kingdom).The state carries out the
insurance function in these countries but
not the services. It is the insurance market
that is hampered by severe market failure.
In Germany, the current system is a consolidation, begun under Bismarck in 1883, of a
system of guild-based insurance schemes.
For most OECD countries, the current
system of public ownership or control
dates from a time after World War II when
they had incomes at least as high as the
upper-middle-income countries today.
Before these programs were brought under
public management, the state already had
regulatory powers over the medical profession. The timing was fortuitous since it was
only in the 20th century that technical
changes in medicine made public
oversight essential.
Universal public education is also fairly
recent. It came out of a conﬂict between
church and state. In the period of expansion
of public facilities, the main mechanism was

incorporating private schools into the public network after a system of managing individual schools had already developed.
Even the core networked services of
water, electricity, gas, and railways—services
now thought of as natural monopolies—
began as purely private activities. In the
United Kingdom early water systems were
sometimes developed with duplicate pipes
laid by competing ﬁrms. Only after coverage was substantial were these
rationalized—and then for reasons of public health rather than duplication. German
railways also began with duplicate lines. In
other cases, companies worked out agreements that divided markets without the
duplication experienced in the railway markets in the United States and England—for
example, bus systems in many large urban
areas and German natural gas transport.
These were then brought under a regulatory regime but only after reaching quite
high service penetration.
In each of these cases the independent
regulatory capacity of the policymaker preceded the incorporation of private
providers into a public system.

Multiple tasks
Personnel in health clinics are supposed to
provide curative care to people who come to
them. They are also to provide immunizations, health education, and other preventive
measures to everyone, whether they come in
on their own or not. And they are to keep
statistics, attend training sessions and meetings, and do inspections of water and food.
Police ofﬁcers have to deal with everyone
from lost children to dangerous criminals.
They are, at various times, investigators of
crimes, social workers intervening in neighborhood and family disputes, and disseminators of information. This diffusion naturally blunts the precision of incentives.

Measuring and attributing
outcomes
The most difﬁcult problems, particularly for
the social sectors, are the dual problems of
measuring outcomes and attributing these
outcomes to the actions of providers. Test
scores may adequately reﬂect certain educational goals, but abstract thinking and social
adaptability are not so easily measured. The
alleviation of pain is a subjective judgment
of the patient. Many outcomes, even when
observable to the patient and the doctor, are
not “contractible” in the sense that, if a dispute arises, compliance can be proved to a
judge or other mediator. And attributing
impacts to provider actions is difﬁcult in
almost all social services.
These problems make it impossible to have
performance contracts that make payments to

BOX 6.5

“Anyone who has worked in a formal organization—even a small one strictly
governed by detailed rules—knows that
handbooks and written guidelines fail
utterly in explaining how the institution
goes about its work. Accounting for its
smooth operation are nearly endless and
shifting sets of implicit understandings,
tacit coordinations, and practical mutualities that could never be successfully
captured in a written code.This ubiquitous
social fact is useful to employees and labor
unions.The premise behind what are
tellingly called work-to-rule strikes is a case
in point. When Parisian taxi drivers want to

press a point on the municipal authorities
about regulations or fees, they sometimes
launch a work-to-rule strike. It consists
merely in following meticulously all the regulations in the Code routier and thereby
bringing trafﬁc throughout central Paris to a
grinding halt.The drivers thus take tactical
advantage of the fact that the circulation of
trafﬁc is possible only because drivers have
mastered a set of practices that have
evolved outside, and often in contravention,
of the formal rules.”

Source: Scott (1998).

individual frontline providers depend on outcomes. All contracts will necessarily be
incomplete, requiring at least some payment
of wages independent of outputs. When the
actions of the provider are speciﬁed in great
detail, the results are often less than optimal
because of inﬂexible response to local variation. The impossibility of specifying such
rules ahead of time is illustrated by “work-torule” strikes, in which strikers bring an activity
to a “grinding halt” by following rules entirely
to the letter (box 6.5). The balance between
control and ﬂexibility is not easily struck.
Further, since the provider does many
things, some or all of them hard to observe by
the policymaker, there is the ever-present risk
that payments for measured outcomes will
displace hard-to-measure tasks (box 6.6).
This risk has been discussed in the education
literature as “teaching to the test.” When
teacher compensation (pay or promotion
prospect) is measured by students’ performance on a standard test, there will be a tendency to downplay those aspects of pedagogy
not covered by the test and to concentrate on
those that are. In Kenya teachers manipulated
test scores by offering tutoring sessions aimed
speciﬁcally at these tests. There was no
improvement in other indicators of quality,
such as homework assignments, teacher
absences, or teaching methods.293
Several industrial countries, in reforming
the civil service or other providers of public
services, have tried to use performance contracts. The evidence of success is mixed:294
many problems are tied to the dependence of
the policymaker on information the agency
provides—a problem closely related to the
regulation of private ﬁrms. Some information used for performance contracts can be
easily falsiﬁed or, less pejoratively, presented
in too favorable a light. For example, when
education reforms were instituted in the
United Kingdom, truancies were redeﬁned as
excused absences.295

Overcoming the limits
Separating policymakers from provider organizations can help sharpen incentives to help
poor people. Assigning policymakers the role
of devising a compact for the provider organization and assigning provider organizations the responsibility of management can

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

13_WDR_Ch06.qxd 8/14/03 9:10 AM Page 101

Policymakers and providers

enable the use of higher-powered incentives
to align the interests of the frontline provider
with those of the policymaker representing
the poor, for the following three reasons.
First, policymakers, balancing political pressures, can help insulate providers from the
problem of satisfying masters with conﬂicting aims and offer unambiguous instructions. Second, provider organizations can
face performance-based payments when
individuals cannot. Third, managers of the
provider organizations, if they have ﬂexibility
over operational decisions, can supervise staff
and choose the appropriate form of remuneration that best reﬂects local conditions.

Insulating providers from politics
That providers have to satisfy many masters
reﬂects the inability of government to insulate them from political pressures. While policymakers for education need to address
concerns of potential employers, teachers’
unions, or interest groups who want to inﬂuence curricula, there is no reason why this
should affect day-to-day activities in a
school, or indeed any organization of frontline providers. If the policymaking function
can be separated from the provider organization, the policymaker can handle the politics
of the overall objectives of education while
the provider can be given more precise
instructions and be held accountable to the
policymaker. Poor people might legitimately
delegate to policymakers curriculum development as well as the responsibility to balance their interests with those of unions.

Organizations and individuals
Individual providers will not accept performance contracts that leave them exposed to
excessive risk. But the variability of aggregate
performance over all providers in an organization—say, those dealing with infant mortality for a district—is very much smaller,
which provides a way of sharing the risk.
While a single doctor may not be able to
absorb the risk to income of the bad luck of
any particular patient, a district health board
would. Teams—schools, school districts,
health boards, city police departments—can
be the recipients of performance-based
incentives where teachers, nurses, and policemen cannot (see spotlight on Costa Rica and

problem of economies of scale as well. Some
tasks can be divided into groups of complementary activities—all immunizations as a
group, say, or all health education activities
based on home visits (chapter 8). Then a
fairly homogeneous organization can be
charged with the responsibility to carry out a
simpler set of tasks, with clear standards of
accountability.
Reform in Johannesburg, South Africa
(see spotlight), was in large part a reevaluation of the appropriate set of services to be
grouped together to deliver speciﬁed outputs.
Departments were reorganized so that their
outputs were clearly identiﬁable and veriﬁable, with the department’s CEO able to
retain any savings over contract expenditures.
At one extreme, commercial enterprises—
such as the athletics stadium, the airport, and
metro gas—were simply sold to the private
sector and directly faced the forces of the
market, where payment is very much dependent on outcomes.296

Management ﬂexibility
Each of these potential effects depends on
managers in provider organizations having the
ﬂexibility and authority to design the incentives for the frontline providers in their organizations. This allows them to adapt to local (or
sectoral) variation to see whether performance
pay or salaries with supervision works better.
Flexibility for the manager is essential, a major
part of “institutional capacity.” Managers must
have control over the pay scheme or the sanctions for poor performance.
Salaried systems work as long as there is
the ability either to ﬁre or to grant raises on

the basis of merit. The worst case is when
salaried workers face neither sanctions for
poor performance nor increased pay or prestige for good performance. Civil servants in
Singapore enjoy high salaries and a lot of
prestige, but also work under a credible threat
of being ﬁred. A problem with some of the
recent reforms in developed countries instituting contractual relations with providers is
that they undermine the public service ethos.
(“If I am to be treated as a mercenary, I might
as well act like one.”) Increased accountability
through monetary incentives was partly offset by reduced accountability through internal motivation.297 Developing countries that
have instilled this sense of duty should be
wary of compromising it. But they should be
brutally honest with themselves before
declaring this a major consideration.
Sometimes performance pay is appropriate and necessary but should be a matter for
local experimentation. Several health interventions have beneﬁted greatly by introducing performance-based incentives for workers
(box 6.7). In other contexts, those incentives
are precisely what is needed to obtain particular desired results. In the British National
Health Service most general practitioner pay
is determined on the basis of capitation payBOX 6.7

Incentive pay works for speciﬁc health
interventions

The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), one of the largest NGOs in
Bangladesh, paid workers to teach mothers
how to use oral rehydration therapy for children with diarrhea. Independent of the
providers, bonuses were paid on the basis
of surveys of random samples of 5–10 percent of the mothers.The greater the number of women who could explain how to
make and use the rehydration solution, the
higher the payment. More than half of total
compensation was paid as a bonus.
The mothers’ knowledge increased dramatically—to 65 percent of those taught
two years after the training. Most important,
the teaching techniques that the workers
used changed from standard lectures to
more hands-on demonstrations. Rather
than have the right teaching technique
speciﬁed for them from on high, workers
developed the best way to achieve the
measured outcome—ﬁnding out for themselves what worked in their context.

In Haiti, NGOs were given performancebased contracts, directly from the U.S.
Agency for International Development, to
provide preventive health care services
such as immunizations, health education,
prenatal care, and family planning. Again, an
independent monitor, l’Institut Haitien de
l’Enfance, a local survey research ﬁrm, was
used to verify performance. Immunization
rates increased dramatically along with several other outputs. Interestingly, some of the
NGOs experimented with performance pay
themselves but found lower morale and
performance when workers (low paid themselves) faced such risky incomes.The NGOs,
while satisﬁed with the high-powered
incentives by which they were paid, found
better ways to pay frontline providers in
accordance with local circumstances.

and Pollock (2001).

ments—for how many people sign up with
the doctor. But it is supplemented by speciﬁc
additional payments for the provision of
immunizations to counter any incentive to
skimp on this priority service.

New providers for expanding supply
Where will the providers of services come
from? One possibility is that competition for
compacts will attract more provider organizations. The beneﬁts from competition are
reduced costs, greater effort, and better
information—even when public provision is
the dominant form, as long as public and
other provider organizations are treated
even-handedly. Three types of competition
are relevant for services: competition in the
market, competition for the market, and
benchmarking.
Competition. Competition in the market
simply means allowing private providers. For
health and education, such providers are
everywhere, and in many places larger players than the government (chapter 4). Recent
technological advances have made it possible
to open services formerly believed to be natural monopolies to competition. Independent power producers, for example, can be
used to sell electricity to a larger grid. The
cost of allowing free entry into natural
monopolies is the risk of inefﬁcient duplication of investments. Efﬁcient regulation is
necessary but complicated. If political and
administrative limitations on the independence and effectiveness of regulators are
severe, allowing the duplication may be the
lesser of two evils.298
The impact of competition can go both
ways: the presence of the public sector can
impose indirect discipline on the private sector, both on prices and on quality. In Malaysia
a credible public health system has kept price
rises modest in the private sector.299 The beneﬁts of public provision extend beyond the
numbers of patients treated publicly. Similarly, the presence of qualiﬁed medical personnel can force quality improvements in
private markets.300
If natural monopolies exist, there can be
competition for the market. Potential competitors bid for concessions—compacts—to
provide the service. Much government pro-

curement in richer countries uses this model.
It requires the ability to let, monitor, and
enforce the explicit contracts for the winner.
Recent innovations in the state of Madhya
Pradesh in India allow NGOs to compete for
concessions to primary schools. Payments are
conditional on improved test scores based on
independent measurement. One advantage
the developing world has over earlier experience in Europe is that it has ﬁrms with good
reputations and experience in the supply of
water, power, and transport—and international courts for dispute resolution.301 But
the recent experience of Enron in India’s
Maharashtra State provides a reality check on
over-enthusiasm for these beneﬁts.
Benchmark or yardstick competition can
be used when different providers are given
parts of a larger system to run. Even when the
public sector is the main provider of services,
information from varying experiences can be
valuable. Information on costs of production
may be much cheaper to obtain by simple
observation of one’s own activities than from
detailed technology assessments. Information on consumer preferences may be
cheaper to obtain by counting customers
than by conducting market research.
For road construction in Johannesburg, an
explicit contract was made between the city
manager and an autonomous public agency,
the Johannesburg Road Agency, to build a
given number of kilometers of road for a
negotiated price. The basis of the negotiation
was the set of historical costs in the public
agencies. The manager of the autonomous
agency then used both the public works
department and private sector ﬁrms as contractors. Competition among the contractors
determined subsequent allocations of funds.
Even though it was not possible to ﬁre personnel from the public agency, competition for
funds ensured that the public agency would
match the efﬁciency of the private ﬁrms
(which it did for many contracts). There
could be a gradual shift to private provision,
but only on the basis of proven performance.
Limits to competition and the search for
suppliers. For contracts that cannot be
complete, aspects of delivery outside the contract will remain a matter of trust. For the
provision of services to poor people, this trust

is particularly important because there are
fewer “perks” for working in poor areas—private earnings after working hours (for medical personnel and teachers) are lower, living
conditions harsher.
In the long run, a public sector with a strong
ethos of public service will be needed. In many
places it already exists. It does no good to pretend, however, that expanding the civil service
under current recruitment and incentive
regimes will attract those best suited to serving
poor people. In Nepal an anthropological
study showed that health staff’s view of their
jobs often differed from the ofﬁcial view.302
Many staff saw the health program solely as a
source of employment. A broader set of potential providers is needed to accept the compacts.
NGOs—so much a part of the African
scene and active in several other countries,
such as Bangladesh—are possible candidates.
They are a varied group. Many are not directly
involved in service provision, and many combine service with advocacy. Those that provide
services often have a great deal of autonomy,
choosing where and how to deliver services. To
that extent, they might be treated the same as
the rest of the private sector in planning public
services. The government should not be in the
business of displacing them.
NGOs that have a tradition of altruistic
service can frequently be lower-cost producers. In a recent study, religious NGOs providing health care in Uganda were found to offer
higher-quality service than their public sector
counterparts. They also paid lower wages than
the private sector and very much lower than
the public sector. Unlike the private sector,
they were more likely to provide public health
services (as opposed to simply medical care)
and to charge less. And they used an extra cash
grant to lower fees and provide more services,
such as laboratory tests, whereas the public
sector used the grant to increase pay.303
NGOs are often, though not always, better
able to reach poor people. A substantially
higher fraction of the clientele of NGOs providing health care in Zambia comes from
poorer segments of society than does the clientele of government facilities or private
providers.304 But even they have a hard time
reaching the very poorest. NGOs may also be
in a better position, with their greater ﬂexibility
and their internal motivation, to bring services

to otherwise excluded groups (box 6.8). And
smaller organizations can reach niche populations that a broad-based bureaucracy may
ﬁnd hard to serve.
In combating AIDS, community outreach
often needs to deal with prostitutes, drug users,
and very sick, stigmatized people. The same
difﬁculties in assigning public personnel to
remote areas have been found in reaching these
subgroups. In Brazil, however, NGOs competing for government funds were able to reach
high-risk segments of society that usually avoid
public programs (such as prostitutes), to distribute 2.6 million contraceptives, and to take
11,000 hotline calls. The relative independence
of NGOs from the core of the public service
may make it easier for them to fund their activities from public resources by granting policymakers an extra layer of deniability.
The altruistic motives of people working
in NGOs can overcome the incompleteness of
contracts. NGO providers are generally less
likely than for-proﬁt providers to exploit the
difﬁculties of monitoring contract terms for
their own beneﬁt. Their altruism may partly
outweigh a reluctance to locate in difﬁcult,
remote, rural areas that are hard to staff with
civil servants. This possibility has led one analyst, thinking of Africa, to conclude that services to poor people may, for the time being,
have to be left to such groups, particularly the
church.305
Once again, patience is called for. Donor
enthusiasm has led to a massive proliferation of
NGOs, many of them not at all motivated by
BOX 6.8

NGOs can be more ﬂexible than government

One advantage that NGOs may have over
the public sector is the freedom from ﬁxed
civil service rules or standard operating procedures. In some ways this reduces accountability, but it can avoid unnecessary
constraints.
A social worker in a family protection program calls on a family threatened with having a child removed for neglect. She’s
greeted by the mother, who says “If there is
one thing I don’t need in my life right now,
it’s one more social worker telling me what
to do.You know what I really need? To get
my house cleaned up.”
The social worker, who happened to be
a highly trained clinical psychologist,
responded by saying,“Would you like to

start in the kitchen?” While the two women
were cleaning, they had a terriﬁc conversation about what was going on in that family. When I told the story at a meeting, I was
interrupted by the head of a university clinical psych department who said,“What that
therapist did was unprofessional.”
Well, all I can say is if we want effective
interventions that have transformative
effects on people, then we had better redeﬁne what is professional, or allowable in the
expenditure of public funds.
(from Common Purpose by Schorr, 1997)
In many countries there is no way for
publicly employed social workers to violate
the opinions of the university professor, but
more independent NGOs could do so.

altruism.306 Indeed, many appear to be run by
former civil servants who have lost their jobs as
a result of the downsizing of public sectors but
who know how to approach donors and government contracting agencies. A rapid expansion of contracts for NGOs will tend to attract
the same people, and their motives may be
exactly the same as those of a for-proﬁt ﬁrm—
requiring the same monitoring and care in contract enforcement. NGOs with a track record of
good performance and dedication to poor people are potentially very important elements of a
strategy to extend services to the neediest people. But establishing a track record, by its very
nature, does not happen as fast as donors would
like. The development of trust takes time.
New challenges to supply. Although there
may be ways to extend the supply of providers
by promoting competition and efﬁcient contracting with NGOs and the private sector, two
recent trends in developing countries are making skilled professionals scarcer, or more
expensive. First, professionals—doctors, teachers, and engineers—are increasingly part of
integrated global markets and recruitment
needs to compete at world wage rates. And it is
not only to the rich countries that staff are emigrating. Botswana, for example, has been
recruiting teachers from other, poorer Englishspeaking countries. The global market for services is changing rapidly due to international
agreements and could lead to new sources of
supply. Whether this turns out to help or hinder services in developing countries remains to
be seen (see box 6.9).
Second, HIV/AIDS, particularly in SubSaharan Africa, has dealt a major blow to the
ranks of service providers. More teachers died
of AIDS in Malawi in 2000 than entered the
profession (see box 1.2). Botswana’s search for
teachers, originally to meet a burgeoning
demand for education, was given greater
urgency by the country’s AIDS problem. And
just as demands for health service workers are
increasing, their supply is being cut.
When a factor of production becomes
scarcer, its use must be conserved—in one of
two ways. First, techniques that are less skillintensive can be chosen. Distance learning,
while not ideal for pedagogical purposes, may
need to be explored to save scarce teaching
time. Similarly, it may be appropriate to use

water systems that require less technical
inputs for maintenance. Second, some kinds
of services that happen to be highly skillintensive may be reduced. Curative medical
services that require trained professionals may
be cut back relative to public works or public
health education, more intensive in capital
and unskilled labor. It is possible that these
interventions (low-maintenance water systems, use of village health workers or traditional healers) may always have been under-

used. Recent trends may merely have made
this misallocation more costly.

Monitoring and performance
All contracts—both compacts and management relationships within provider
organizations—need to be monitored with
independence and objectivity. With the separation of the policymaker and the provider organization, the policymaker will want to know
whether compact provisions are satisﬁed.

Is the GATS a help or a hindrance?

For a new agreement that has so far not had
much impact on actual policy, the WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is
viewed with a surprising degree of both hope
and trepidation. In the current Doha agenda
negotiations, some look to the GATS to deliver
much-needed reform of services from which the
poor will also beneﬁt, while others see it as a
threat to regulatory sovereignty and pro-poor
policies.
In principle, multilateral negotiations can
foster reform in services, as in goods, by eliminating or reducing protective barriers through
mutual agreement and by lending credibility to
the results achieved through legally binding
commitments.The expectation is that more
open markets and greater predictability of policy will lead to the more efﬁcient provision of
services.That is the rationale for the GATS. We
address three questions: How much marketopening has happened so far under the GATS?
Does the agreement prevent recourse to the
complementary policies needed to ensure that
the poor have access to essential services in liberalized markets? Could the GATS process lead
to liberalization before other necessary reforms,
and how can this be prevented?
The GATS is certainly wide in scope. It
applies to virtually all government measures
affecting trade in almost all services, including
educational, health, and environmental services.
Moreover, in recognition of the fact that many
services require proximity between consumers
and suppliers, trade in services is deﬁned to
include not only cross-border supply but also
foreign investment and the temporary migration of service consumers and providers.The
broad reach of the GATS contrasts with the ﬂexibility of its rules.The generally applicable rules
merely require of each country that its tradeaffecting measures be transparent and not discriminate among its trading partners.Thus, if a
country were to prohibit all foreign supply and
make this fact public, then it would have met its
general obligations.
The extent of market openness guaranteed
by a country depends on its sector-speciﬁc com-

mitments.These promises to eliminate or limit
barriers to foreign supply were mainly the outcome of negotiations—but some were volunteered, particularly in telecommunications. Most
existing commitments entailed little liberalization beyond existing market conditions. Many
countries committed on tourism, ﬁnancial, business, and telecommunication services, but relatively few in health, education, and environmental services. Of the 145 WTO member countries,
only 43 (12 developing) have made
commitments in primary education, 52 (24
developing) in hospital services, and none on
water distribution (which was not an explicit
part of the original negotiating list of services
sectors).
The most serious charge against the GATS
is not its meager harvest of liberalization—
after all the process has only recently begun—
but that it deprives governments of the freedom to pursue pro-poor policies. It is argued
that the rules of the agreement threaten public education, health, and environmental services; outlaw universal service obligations and
subsidized supply; and undermine effective
domestic regulation. These charges do not
seem well founded for three reasons. First, services supplied in the exercise of governmental
authority are excluded from the scope of the
GATS, although the deﬁnition—services that
are not supplied on a commercial basis or
competitively—offers scope for clariﬁcation.
Second, even in sectors that have been
opened to full competition, the agreement
does not prevent the pursuit of domestic policy objectives, including through subsidies or
the imposition of universal service obligations
as long as these do not discriminate against
foreign suppliers. Finally, the agreement recognizes the right of members, particularly developing countries, to regulate to meet national
policy objectives, and its current rules on
domestic regulations are hardly intrusive.
However, the concerns noted above are not
so much about what the GATS is but what it may
become after the current (and any future) round
of negotiations—which will aim for more liber-

alizing commitments and new rules in areas
such as domestic regulation. Informed debate
would undoubtedly help ensure that future
GATS rules and commitments reﬂect broader
development concerns and not just the dictates
of domestic political economy or external negotiating pressure.
At this stage, however, the main issue is not
so much what the GATS forces countries to do or
what it prevents them from doing, but that it
does not—indeed cannot—ensure the complementary action that is needed to deliver pro-poor
liberalization.This raises a legitimate concern: in a
complex area like services, trade negotiations alone
could lead to partial or inappropriately sequenced
reform. One possibility—already visible in some
cases—is that less emphasis will be placed on
introducing competition than on allowing a
transfer of ownership of monopolies from
national to foreign hands or protecting the position of foreign incumbents. Another is that market opening will be induced in countries that
have not developed regulatory frameworks and
mechanisms to achieve basic social policy objectives.These ﬂaws could conceivably make the
poor worse off.The problem is accentuated by
the difﬁculty in reversing inappropriate policy
choices that have been translated into legally
binding external commitments.
The danger of adverse outcomes would be
substantially reduced if two types of activities
receive greater international support.The ﬁrst is
increased policy research and advice within
developing countries and outside to identify the
elements of successful reform—and to sift the
areas where there is little reason to defer market
opening from those where there is signiﬁcant
uncertainty and a consequent need for tempered
negotiating demands. An even greater need is for
enhanced technical and ﬁnancial assistance to
improve the regulatory environment and propoor policies in developing countries.The development community is already providing such
support, but a stronger link could be established
between any market opening negotiated internationally and assistance for the complementary
reform needed to ensure successful liberalization.

Competition among providers helps, since
the policymaker will not feel locked into a
particular provider, obliged to ignore bad
news. If the separation between the two is not
achieved, an independent regulator or auditor
should be assigned the monitoring activities.
Clear and observable provisions make
monitoring easier. When the provisions are not
so easily observed, the policymaker may want
to enlist the help of other kinds of monitors.
The health program in Ceará, Brazil (see spotlight), used applicants to the program who had
not been selected as informal monitors.
When monitoring is difﬁcult because of the
technical nature of the service, self-monitoring
by professionals may be necessary. In
Bangladesh attendance by staff is much higher
in larger facilities due to informal self-monitoring, among other factors.307 Professional
associations can also serve as self-monitors,
establishing professional, ethical, and technical
standards for medical care providers, teachers,
and engineers. But the risk in self-regulation is
that professional groups become effective lobbyists for their members.
A third source of monitors is the public.
Even if clients are not the active monitors
described in chapter 4—that is, they are not
purchasers of services or direct participants in
service delivery—soliciting information (as
private business often does) can be useful in
public services. Publicizing the results of
scorecards led to a substantial improvement
of many services run by the Bangalore Municipal Corporation. This practice was replicated
in most states in India.
When day-to-day monitoring to assess
performance is not possible, independent
monitoring of the performance of services on
an occasional basis can still be valuable—by
bringing public information to bear on
provider behavior. The Public Expenditure
Tracking Survey in Uganda (see spotlight on
Uganda) is an example. More regular publicity of service characteristics on several dimensions—such as absentee rates, regular delivery
of pharmaceuticals, hours of operation for
electricity or water—could all mobilize community concern and informal inﬂuence.

Evaluation
Generating and disseminating information
are powerful ways of improving service deliv-

ery. They are also clear public goods and core
responsibilities of government. Accurate information can motivate the public, particularly
the poor, to demand better services—from
providers and from policymakers—and arm
them with facts. Knowledge of the real impact
of programs helps the policymaker set priorities and design better compacts. Knowledge of
the impact of different techniques of service
delivery helps the provider organization better
fulﬁll its compact. If the means to better service is the alignment of incentives with outcomes, knowing what those outcomes are and
how services contribute to them is central.
Good evaluation is the research necessary to
assign causality between program inputs and
real outcomes. It should be directed at the full
impact of programs—not just the direct outputs of speciﬁc projects. But few evaluations
have been done well, even though most major
donors (including the World Bank) have always
made provisions for them. Evaluation, though
primarily a responsibility of governments, is an
area in which donors can help. It costs a small
fraction of the programs examined and a small
fraction of the value of the information produced, but it does require some expensive technical inputs. And since other countries will use
the results, the international community should
defray some of the costs.
There are impediments to collecting such
information. Provider organizations often do
not want to acknowledge their lack of impact
(even if it does not affect their pay directly),
but knowing when things are not working is
essential for improvements. Further, it is necessary to know not just what works but also
why—to replicate the program and increase
the scale of coverage.

Provider incentives
in eight sizes
Returning to the decision tree of ﬁgure 6.2
from the perspective of provider incentives,
the decision concerning the difﬁculty of
monitoring is, of course, key. When monitoring is easy—sizes 1, 3, 5, and 7—opportunities for more explicit incentives and the
use of contracts should be explored. However, contracting with a private sector is
often a bad idea for sizes 5 and 7. Such contracts are a common source of corruption
that governments ﬁnd harder to manage

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

13_WDR_Ch06.qxd 8/14/03 9:13 AM Page 107

Policymakers and providers

and citizens ﬁnd harder to detect than if
services were provided by government.
When monitoring is difﬁcult—the evennumbered sizes—one goal is to improve the
ability to monitor with the methods discussed in this chapter. More competition,
more careful measurement of outcomes,
the evaluation of the effect of inputs on
outcomes, and the provision of incentives
to groups of providers such as schools or
districts can all help.

The boxes suggest eight sizes appropriate
in different circumstances. They also indicate the relative difﬁculty of carrying them
out—the degree of government failure
associated with them. Generally speaking,
the severity of the government failure
increases with the size number. The degree
of market failure needed to justify relatively
easy policies to carry out is modest, or,
equivalently, the highest-priority policies
are those with large market failures or

1 Central government financing with contracting. Performance contracts
let by government. Contract recipients can be public providers, NGOs or
the private sector as long as rewards can be made contingent on
outcomes. Network infrastructure can have national oversight. Contracts
require information for monitoring, low risk of government failure or of
contracting.
2 Central government provision. Technical reforms to allow better
monitoring of outcomes that allow a movement toward size 1 may be
considered. These are the “New Zealand reforms.” Otherwise, (a) if
difficult for government to monitor but easier for clients, consider using
latter as monitors as in chapter 4; (b) evaluations of programs provide
essential information. Low risk of government failure depending on
monitoring abilities.
3 De-concentrated central or local government provision with contracting.
As in size 1 but: performance contracts possible by local or deconcentrated central government. Local or regional regulatory boards for
network infrastructure. Low risk of government failure if government can
accommodate relevant variation in preferences.
4 Local or de-concentrated central government provision.
As in size 2, some reforms to improve monitoring may be possible.
Contracts need more flexibility to accommodate differing preferences.
Incentives to “teams” of providers. Regular evaluation of program
success essential for replication and scaling up. Risk of government
failure moderate since both monitoring and variation of preferences are
challenges.
5 Client power—experiment with contracts. Communities may rely on
contracting with private sector or NGOs. Contracts let by problematic
levels of government are prone to corruption. If only local government is
a problem, center can contract as in size 1 with local government as
potential provider subject to contract monitoring. Government failure is
moderate if communities can be given more authority or only one level of
government is problematic.
6 Client power—experiment with providers. Explicit contracts difficult.
Communities (and donors) may want to rely on altruistic providers since
monitoring is difficult (subject to caveats in chapters 4 and 11). Public
dissemination of information is essential. Government failure moderate to
severe.
7 Client power—experiment with community control. Similar to size 5.
Public disclosure essential. Evaluation of program performance
important. Risk of government failure moderate to severe due to the
added problem of accommodating varying preferences.
8 Client power—imitate market. Similar to size 6. Local input important
from varying preferences. Evaluation of program performance and public
disclosure is essential. Risk of government failure is severe.

strong redistributive effects. For the hardest cases such as case 8, market failures
must be quite costly to justify intervention,
given the many legitimate claims on government.
Including government’s ability to
implement—that is, the degree of government failure to be expected—can lead to a
substantial re-ranking of public policies
relative to conventional analyses. For
social security systems, for example, there
is no particular reason on conventional
economic grounds for the public sector to
send out checks to pensioners. But many
governments with well-developed administrative procedures do it quite well, and
there is no compelling reason to change—
market failures are not terrible but neither
is it hard for government to do. Much of
the controversy about whether rich countries should emulate New Zealand’s
reforms surrounds this point. New innovations in contracting with a private sector or with a government agency might
improve the functioning of government
somewhat. But if government is already
doing tasks acceptably, the gains may be
small and possibly not worth the disruption caused by the change itself.
When applied to the health sector some
standard prescriptions are reinforced by
these considerations while others are challenged. The provision of traditional public
health services, such as pest control to prevent infectious disease, is relatively easy to
carry out. But stafﬁng and maintaining a
large network of primary health centers in
remote areas is often hard to do, even
though the redistribution effects are
potentially beneﬁcial. It might be wiser,
until government capabilities improve, to
try to get poor people to government facilities, even to much maligned hospitals,
than get facilities to poor people. Not only
would this address a serious market failure, the absence of insurance for expensive
care, but it will be easier to implement
since working in less remote areas is more
consistent with providers’ interests and
easier to monitor, with a smaller number
of larger facilities.308

Scaling up, scaling back,
and wising up
There is no “right” way to make sure services
reach poor people. The appropriate technical
interventions—and the institutional structures that generate them—vary enormously.
Education was expanded dramatically in
Chile by markets and vouchers, in Cuba by a
central ministry, and in El Salvador by local
school committees. Beyond trial and error,
scaling up means watching what you’re
doing, evaluating whether it works, determining why it works or doesn’t, replicating
success, and evaluating the replications as
well. Sometimes things work for idiosyncratic reasons—a charismatic (and literally
irreplaceable) leader or a particular (and
unrepeatable) crisis that solidiﬁes support for
a politically difﬁcult innovation. So one-time
successes may not be replicable. Experimentation, with real learning from the experiments, is the only way to match appropriate
policies with each country’s circumstances.
Scaling up also means scaling back—
abandoning failures unless a good, remediable reason for failure is found. Abandoning
failures is harder than it sounds. Simply
admitting failure is hard enough, particularly
for politicians. But with the severe resource
constraints in developing countries—they
are poor after all—badly performing programs are simply unaffordable. Where programs are intensive in management (and
auditors and managerial talent are scarce) or
intensive in trained personnel (and teachers
and doctors are scarce), states need to let go
of programs that are not working and ﬁnd
alternative ways to achieve better outcomes.
If the political will exists, the key to scaling
up is information. Beyond evaluating programs and projects, a continuing focus on
making services work for poor people—educated children, better health, reliable water,
lighted homes, safer streets—depends on the
continuing measurement of progress toward
these goals. “What gets measured is what
counts.” This focus on outcomes helps policymakers choose the best options for serving
poor people. It helps the providers know
when they are doing a good job. And it helps
clients judge the performance of both.

Cambodia

Contracts to improve health services—quickly
Cambodia began experimenting with different forms of contracting to improve health services in 1998. The lesson—
thanks to good evaluation—is that contracting can help increase the coverage of some key services in a short time.

M

ore than 25 years of conﬂict left
Cambodia with little health
infrastructure. In the late 1990s
its health indicators were among the worst
in Southeast Asia. Average life expectancy at
birth was less than 55 years. Infant mortality was 95 per 1,000 live births. And maternal mortality was 437 per 100,000 live
births.309 The public health care system
remained rudimentary: average facility use
was 0.35 contacts per person per year, and
patients complained of very low quality.
Then in 1998 the government contracted with nongovernmental entities to
provide health services in several districts.
The contracting increased access to health
services—and not at the expense of equity.

Contracting primary health care
services (in and out)
Intervention and control areas consisted of
randomly selected rural districts, each with
100,000 to 200,000 people.310 Contractors
were chosen through a competitive process
based on the quality of their technical proposal and their price. Three approaches
were used.

•

Contracting out. Contractors had full
responsibility for the delivery of speciﬁed services in the district, directly
employed their staff, and had full management control (two districts).

•

Contracting in. Contractors provided
only management support to civil service health staff, and recurrent operating costs were provided by the government through normal government
channels (three districts).

•

Control areas. The usual government
provision was retained (four districts).

A budget supplement was provided to contracted-in and control districts.
Performance indicators were measured
for all the districts by household, and health
facility surveys, which were conducted in
1997 before the experiment. No district had

more than 20 percent of its planned health
facilities functioning. All had very poor
health service coverage. And all were comparable in their socioeconomic status.
Annual per capita recurrent spending by
donors and government was higher in the
contracted-out districts: $2.80 in the contracted-in districts, $4.50 in contracted-out
districts, compared with $2.90 in control
districts.311 These differences are large and
represent slightly less than 20 percent of the
health expenditures (including private and
excluding capital investments from the government) in all of the districts.

Contracting for better results
All districts improved service coverage in a
short time. After only 2.5 years of the fouryear experiment, all districts had achieved
their contractual obligations for most of
the evaluation indicators.312 The use of
health services among the poorest half of
the populace increased by nearly 30 percentage points in the contracted-out district (ﬁgure 1). One possible explanation is
that the contracted-out districts did not
charge ofﬁcial user fees; they also discouraged health care workers from taking
“unofﬁcial” user fees by paying signiﬁcantly higher salaries to providers than in
the other types of districts.
The pattern of increases is similar
across a variety of service and coverage
indicators (ﬁgure 2). The contracted-out
districts often outperformed contracted-in
districts, which outperformed control districts. But not all indicators were as responsive. The share of deliveries assisted
changed by only a small amount in all three
districts. And there was no difference
between contracted-in and contracted-out
districts in the increase in vitamin A coverage. The level of immunization in contracted districts also remained quite modest, peaking at only 40 percent.
Out-of-pocket expenditures on health
care services fell dramatically in the contracted-out districts but increased slightly

in contracted-in and control districts. The
reduction was especially marked among the
poor ($35 a year, or 70 percent), indicating
better targeting and more efﬁcient transfers
of subsidies.
Even though the health ministry encouraged all districts to implement ofﬁcial user
fees, only one contracted-in district established a formal user fee system and used the
receipts from the system to reward health
care workers with monthly performance
and punctuality bonuses. That could
account for slightly higher spending for this
type of district.313
There are several possible reasons for
these pro-poor outcomes in the contracted
districts.

•

The regular availability of drugs and qualiﬁed staff strengthened service provision
at health centers in the villages, where
most poor people are concentrated.

•

The contracted nongovernmental organizations used a market-based wage and
beneﬁts package to attract and retain
health care providers.

•

A reduction in the private out-of-pocket
cost of services and a more predictable
and transparent fee structure increased
the demand for health care services by
the poor.

The availability of health services in villages reduced travel expenditures to seek
health care, and NGOs enforced rules
against informal payments by patients.

Agreements on deliverables—
and enforceable contracts
Contracting health services to NGOs can
expand the coverage for poor people. In
Cambodia it took agreements on deliverables and an enforceable contract, which in
turn required an independent performance
veriﬁcation system. Once targets for 13 key
health indicators were agreed on—for poor
people—progress toward achieving them
was measured through independent house-

hold surveys and spot checks by government
staff. Payments were linked to achieving targets, with bonuses for better-than-agreed-on
performance.
Improving health services for the poor
requires that health workers be adequately
compensated and effectively supervised and
supported. The NGOs working in contracted-out districts revised the salaries of
health care providers, bringing them in line
with average salaries in the private sector. In
return, the NGOs required the providers to
work full time in health facilities and to
have no private practice.
In the contracted-in districts, the NGOs
supplemented provider salaries with their

own funds and, in one district, allocated a
larger share of user-fee income. The control districts, left to their own devices,
allowed workers to pursue private incomemaximizing behavior through unofﬁcial
fees and private practice, to the detriment
of the public health care services for the
poorest of the poor.
Transparent and predictable fee structures are important in improving access to
health services. Ofﬁcial user charges were
introduced in only one contracted-in district, in consultation with communities, to
provide incentives to health workers. To
remove ambiguity about charges, a schedule of user fees was prominently displayed
in all health facilities. This discouraged private practice and helped bring “under-thetable” payments formally into the system.
Out-of-pocket spending on health fell in
that district. No user fees were introduced
in the other two contracted-in districts, or
in the control districts, where out-of-pocket
spending did not come down.
Contracting health services to NGOs
can be difﬁcult for policymakers to accept.
But the Cambodian experience shows that
it can be effective and equitable. It helped
convince policymakers that the model
could be adopted on a larger scale. They are
extending contracting to 11 poor and
remote districts, where the public provision
of services is dismal.

Basic education services

chapter

An institutional arrangement for basic education should be judged by its production
of high-quality learning, equitably distributed. This requires that children be in
school and that they learn. This in turn rests
on education systems that create relationships of accountability between citizens,
politicians, policymakers, and providers,
with clear objectives, adequate resources,
capable and motivated providers, progress
assessments, and performance-oriented
managements.
Successful education systems vary widely.
Some systems are centralized, others decentralized. Some have almost exclusively public schools, while others provide public support to private providers. But not just
anything goes.
• The politics of schooling—particularly
the effectiveness of the voice of poor
people—determines both the school system’s objectives and the public resources
that go to education.
• The compact between policymakers and
providers of schooling needs to balance
the autonomy of schools and teachers
with performance assessment.
• Schools (and school systems) must be
enabled to manage for performance—
and, particularly, to ﬁnd effective ways to
train and motivate teachers.
• Direct parent and community participation in schools, demand-side inducements
to expand enrollments, and choice—if
correctly designed—can be valuable parts
of an overall plan for school improvement.

Common problems
of service provision
Education systems face the common problems of service provision outlined in chap-

ter 1—unaffordable access, dysfunctional
schools, low technical quality, low client
responsiveness, and stagnant productivity.
But not all countries face the same problems. In many of the poorest countries
there are enormous deﬁcits in affordable
access. Poor people have less access, lower
attainment, and lower quality than those
better off. In many countries public sector
provision is close to dysfunctional and rife
with corruption. The technical quality of
instruction and learning outcomes are
shockingly low, especially among poor people. And even the most advanced economies
struggle to make education systems more
productive.
Shortfalls in universal primary completion—a combined result of children who
never enroll, children who do not progress,
and children who drop out—reﬂect the failures in the system. In Madagascar only 52
percent of 15- to 19-year-olds in the poorest
20 percent of the population had ever
enrolled in school, and only 4 percent completed even grade 5 (ﬁgure 7.1). In Brazil 89
percent of poor adolescents enrolled in
grade 1, but only 30 percent completed
grade 5 because of high dropout and repetition rates. In Turkey high retention through
primary school, followed by a sharp drop in
progress to the next level, suggests that systemic and institutional solutions are
required to increase achievement. In Bangladesh only 60 percent of poor adolescents
have completed grade 1, and only 36 percent have completed grade 5.

Unaffordable access
Despite at least 55 years of acknowledgment
that universal literacy is the heart of development, and despite repeated rhetorical commitments to universal enrollment, even the

Dysfunctional schools
Schooling completions and learning outcomes may fall short because providers are
dysfunctional. While most teachers try conscientiously to do their jobs, one recent survey found a third of all teachers in Uttar
Pradesh, India, absent. Cases of malfeasance
by teachers are distressingly present in many
settings: teachers show up drunk, are physically abusive, or simply do nothing. This is
not “low-quality” teaching—this is not teaching at all.314

modest goal of universal primary school
completion has not been realized. Some
countries have made huge strides—average
completion rates in Brazil expanded from less
than 50 percent in 1990 to more than 70 percent in 2000. But if countries continue at only
their recent rate of progress, universal primary completion would come only after
2020 in the Middle East and North Africa,
after 2030 in South Asia, and not in the foreseeable future in Sub-Saharan Africa.
In the very poorest countries the attainment deﬁcit is spread across the population,
but in most it is concentrated among children from poor households. In countries
with very low attainment, like Mali, most of
the population is rural, and there are substantial deﬁcits in primary completion even
among relatively wealthier and urban families. In India the rural poor (poorest 50 percent) accounted for 72 percent of the deﬁcit
in completion of grade 5 among 15- to 19year-olds, and completion is higher among
boys than girls. In the Philippines the deﬁcit
is much lower, concentrated among the
rural poor and higher among boys than
girls.

The quality of instruction can also be low
because of low capability, weak motivation,
and a lack of complementary inputs. In
very-low-income settings learning outcomes can be dismal. The 1994 Tanzania
Primary School Leavers Examination suggested that the vast majority of students had
learned almost nothing that was tested in
their seven years of schooling—more than
four-ﬁfths scored less than 13 percent correct in language or mathematics.315 In

Bangladesh 30 percent of students who
completed grade 5 were not minimally
competent in reading; 70 percent were not
minimally competent in writing.316
Evidence on learning outcomes is disappointing even in middle-income countries.
For instance, in the recent Programme for
International Student Assessment of the
achievement of 15-year-olds in school, only
5 percent of Brazilian students reached the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) median in
mathematical literacy (ﬁgure 7.2). Fifty-six
percent of Brazilian students were at level 1
(of 5) in reading literacy, compared with 18
percent for students in OECD countries.
Only 4 percent reached proﬁciency levels of
4 or 5, compared with 31 percent for OECD
students.317 This is not to single out Brazil
for poor performance: Brazil is widely recognized for its advances, and its willingness
to participate in the study and its courage in
releasing the results demonstrate a strong
commitment to education outcomes (other
countries have participated in examinations
and then refused to disclose the results). In
addition, in an earlier comparison of 11
Latin American countries Brazil was tied
with Argentina for second place in the
mathematics performance of 4th graders.

Low client responsiveness
When communities are not involved in
establishing, supporting, or overseeing a
school, the school is often seen as something alien. Villagers refer to “the government’s” school, not “our” school. In Voices of
the Poor people often complain of absent or
abusive teachers and demands for illegal
fees to get their children into school or to
inﬂuence examination results.318 A study of
schooling in rural Nigeria found that villagers often stopped expecting anything
from government schools, shouldering the
burden themselves.319

Stagnant productivity
Creating and maintaining an institutional
environment that promotes higher productivity and more learning is not easy. A
recent set of studies documented that
spending per pupil in real terms has
increased by 50 percent or more, often two-

or threefold, in nearly all OECD and East
Asian countries. Yet in none of these countries have test scores improved commensurately.320 The obvious implication of these
two facts is that measured learning achievement per dollar spent has fallen dramatically in every country examined.

For higher-quality systems,
strengthen the relationships
of accountability
Despite enormous differences in attainment, equity, and learning across countries,
the features of school systems are strikingly
similar. Public production is almost always
the dominant—if not exclusive—means of
government support of education. Whether
in Argentina, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Paraguay, or Tanzania, public systems display age-grade organization of classrooms,
replication of social structures and inequalities, and similar ways of training, hiring,
compensating, and promoting teachers.
Despite these surface similarities, there are
widely different outcomes. Both Nigeria
and Singapore retain many of the organizational elements of British education. Yet on
one international achievement test in the
1980s Nigeria was among the worst performers while Singapore is frequently
among the best.
That public provision has often failed to
create universally available and effective
schooling does not imply that the solution
is a radically different approach (complete
decentralization, total control by parent
groups, generalized choice) or a narrow
focus on proximate determinants (more
textbooks, more teacher training). Universal and quality education can come from
very centralized systems (France, Japan) or
from very decentralized systems with considerable local accountability and ﬂexibility
(United States). Many countries have little
private schooling, and some a great deal
(Holland). Classroom practice is what matters. If the underlying causes of failure are
not addressed, all these approaches can fail.
Chapters 3 through 6 developed a framework for analyzing service provision, looking
at four relationships of accountability. In

but do not change the capabilities or incentives
of frontline providers cannot improve quality.
Schools and teachers cannot be made more
accountable for results without also receiving
sufﬁcient autonomy and resources and the
opportunities to build capabilities. Conversely,
schools cannot be given autonomy unless they
are given clear objectives and regular assessments of progress.
What successful education systems share is
a working structure of accountability: clear
objectives, adequate resources, and capable
and motivated providers. This Report focuses
on institutional reforms to achieve that system
of accountability—not on the proximate
determinants of success, such as curriculum
design, pedagogical methods, textbooks,
teacher training, school construction, or new
information technologies. Institutional reforms will achieve desired outcomes by affecting proximate determinants—and proximate
determinants that produce good education are
the outcome of well-structured and well-functioning systems. But efforts to improve proximate determinants through internal management initiatives have usually failed. Why? Not
because of a lack of knowledge of what to do.
But because of lack of the sustained bureaucratic, market, parental, and political pressure
needed to make things work.
The disappointing experience with teacher
training shows the limit of a focus on proxiBOX 7.1

The dismal state of teacher training in Pakistan
circa 1990

“Teacher training in this province is a mockery. We should close down the teacher training institutes and stop this nonsense. I have
been teaching in a B.A./B.Ed. program for
many years and see no signs that I have any
impact on the students I teach.”
—A university education instructor quoted
in Warwick and Reimers (1995).
“Most inmates of this system [two teacher
training institutes] have no respect for
themselves, hence they have no respect for
others.The teachers think the students are
cheats, the students think the teachers have
shattered their ideals. Most of them are disillusioned.They have no hopes, no aims, no
ambitions.They are living from day to day,
watching impersonally as the system crumbles around them.”
—Nauman (1990).

A national survey of Pakistan’s primary
schools suggests that these anecdotal
accounts are only too true. Survey data on
teaching practices “provide no basis for
statements that . . . teacher training makes a
substantial difference to how teachers
teach.” A 1998 study of teacher training
suggests that “staff and faculty are professionally untrained, political interference is
common, resources and facilities are poor
and badly utilized, motivation and expectations are low and there is no system of
accreditation to enforce standards.” Embedded in an education system that was fundamentally unaccountable and lacked any
outcome orientation, teacher training
reﬂected worst practice.

(1998), p. 45.

mate determinants (box 7.1). When teachers
are not consulted in training design—often
the case—poor implementation is the result.
Training may not be integrated into the system, as when teachers are trained in methods
inconsistent with public examinations and so
are reluctant to adopt them. Teachers often
have little incentive besides professional pride
to adopt new methods.
If the underlying problems are not
solved neither bureaucracy nor market will
work well. Increasing client power, by creating mechanisms for communities and parents to improve their local school, is important. But this short-route accountability is
not enough. Improving services also
requires stronger mechanisms of long-route
accountability—accountability of politicians and policymakers for education and
improved proﬁciency in public administration with accountability of the education
bureaucracy for outcomes. There is no
quick ﬁx in an area as complex and extensive as schooling, only the hard slog of gradual improvement through strategic incrementalism, which links current operational
actions with long-run institutional strategies and goals.

Citizens and clients, politicians
and policymakers: voice
In administration of all schools, it must be kept in
mind, what is to be done is not for the sake of the
pupils, but for the sake of the country.
—Mori Anori, Japanese Minister
of Education 1886–89

Politics plays a key role in establishing
objectives for the education system—concerning both distribution and quality—and
in mobilizing resources. The reason is that
schooling, especially at the basic level, has
become an important element in a child’s
socialization.
Those who control the state use schooling
to promote beliefs they consider desirable.
Nearly everywhere this means that schools
promote a sense of national identity, a
national language, and loyalty to the nationstate—in competition with more local or
ethnic afﬁliations—and, in more extreme
cases, a speciﬁc political indoctrination.

Basic education services

to Ataturk’s Turkey—have also used public
schools to supplant or suppress religious
instruction.321 Authoritarian states have used
schooling to disseminate a single acceptable
ideology—for example, Soeharto’s promotion of the ﬁve principles of pancasila322 in
Indonesia. These examples are not the exception but the rule: countries around the world
explicitly use schooling to inculcate ideas
about the proper organization of society.

Voice and the objectives of schooling
Schooling has become a battleground for
political conﬂicts. Different groups want different—often contradictory—things from
schooling. Poor parents see education as an
opportunity for their children to lead better
lives, but they may also want education to
reinforce traditional values. Elites may want
universal education but often promote public spending on higher education for the
beneﬁt of their own children. Urban and
business coalitions may favor more education because it increases the productivity of
their workers, or industrialists may quietly
oppose “too much” education because it
makes workers restive. One recent study of
owners and managers of modern factories
in Northeast Brazil that were moving to cutting-edge business practices revealed a disturbing lack of support for expanding education. Many felt that a primary education
(eight years) was helpful, but more than that
was “dangerous” because it created workers
who were less docile. Many commented that
“too much education is a bad thing.”
(Tendler 2003). Politicians may want to
deliver on promises of universal schooling
while also using the education system to
provide patronage jobs (the example of Pakistan, in box 5.3, is not unique). Teachers
and their unions want high-quality universal education but also higher wages.
To get what you want, you need to know
what you want. But what a society wants
from its schools is not simple and cannot be
decided by experts alone. A recent study of
attempts to improve the quantity and quality of basic education in an Asian country in
the 1990s concluded that even many pedagogically and internally sound reforms did
not have a sustained impact on teaching
practice or student learning. Why?

Because the educational system had no
coherent, consensual focus: “For reforms to
stick, there ﬁrst needs to be a vision for the
future with agreed long-term objectives
derived from stakeholders: informed dialogue with parents, employers, religious leaders, school leavers, and others. The absence of
such a shared long-term quality-of-services
strategy that focused scarce resources on
quality rather than quantity has left the education sector open to the imposition of ideas
from outside: from donors, with agendas of
questionable value to the country’s situation,
or from graduates returning with overseas
degrees and ill-informed, though well-intentioned, agendas of their own.”323
Democracy is not necessary for excellent
schools. The huge variation in commitment
to schooling across the states of India is
enough to suggest that electoral democracy is
also not sufﬁcient for voice to lead to universal
education (see spotlight on Kerala and Uttar
Pradesh). But the absence of democracy or
other means of effective citizen voice has a
huge downside. While one-party states occasionally produce good results (see spotlight
on Costa Rica and Cuba), many authoritarian
regimes have no interest in expanding education or improving its quality. There are two
risks: the system is effective but its goals are
completely set by politicians and policymakers, or the system is ineffective because politicians and policymakers have goals other than
effective provision of services. The results: too
few resources are allocated to education, too
few of those resources reach poor people, and
resources are allocated ineffectively (because
providers are more inﬂuential than citizens).
As more countries move to more democratic modes of choosing leaders, citizen control over the structure and content of curricula gains prominence. Having a common
negotiated vision of the objectives of public
support for schooling makes it easier to move
to the other stages of improving the quality of
schooling—mobilizing
and
allocating
resources, communicating objectives to
providers, and delegating responsibility and
autonomy to schools. Without a clear vision
of goals, reform is reduced to a focus on
inputs and process alone.
The greater the demand for education, the
sharper the vision. In Malawi, Uganda, and

most recently Kenya, a commitment to universal education was a popular stance—
although a difﬁcult commitment to match
with resources (see spotlight on Uganda).

Adequate resources,
adequately distributed
To achieve educational goals politicians and
policymakers—either autonomously or
through the pressure of citizen voice—must
provide adequate resources. To learn effectively, children need affordable access to
infrastructure, inputs, and instruction—far
from the case in many countries. A recent
study of ﬁnancing the global Education for
All initiative compared successful and less
successful countries along three dimensions:

•

•
•

Revenue mobilization for primary education (overall taxation rates, the fraction of spending on schooling, the fraction of that spent on primary schooling).
Unit cost of a year of effective schooling
(teacher salaries and class size).
Internal efﬁciency (years of schooling
provided per primary school completer).

Even with adequate ﬁscal effort, reasonable costs, and internal efﬁciency, many
countries do not generate enough resources
to achieve universal completion. For these
countries there is a compelling case for additional international assistance (see box 2.3).
But in many cases the resources are simply
not used effectively. They are allocated to the
wrong mix of inputs. Too great a share goes to

higher levels of education. Or systems are inefﬁcient in translating resources into outputs. A
common problem is that teacher salaries, even
at very low wages, crowd out all other inputs. A
recent study found that 44 of 55 countries
examined allocated more than 70 percent and
half (23) allocated more than 80 percent of
spending to salaries. Such levels of spending
often imply either inadequate supplies to other
inputs or formal or informal levies on parents.
Empirical studies also show that increases in
teacher salaries have little or no association
with learning outcomes (discussed further
below). Many studies estimate the impact of
selected classroom instructional materials or
school facilities to be some 10 times that of
teacher salaries (this is not to say that simple
“equipment-based” approaches will succeed).
Another common problem is devoting
resources to reduce average class sizes, which
often results in inefﬁciently small classes—
boosting unit costs and limiting access.
Public resources are politically distributed, so the effective distribution of resources
is an issue of voice. A review of the empirical
evidence suggests that the common pattern
of too few resources to high-productivity
inputs is so ubiquitous—ﬁgure 7.3 gives just
two of many possible examples—that it is
likely generated by a political economy that
fails to adequately incorporate the voice of
poor people. Changing this distribution of
resources requires more than a technocratic
adjustment—as Brazil has shown by its
reforms in the 1990s.
Because poor people are almost always the
last enrolled, additional spending that
expands access is more favorable to poorer
households than existing spending. A study
in India found that even though educational
expenditures on average were not more propoor than a uniform transfer would be, the
poor beneﬁted more than proportionately at
the margin when enrollments in primary
education expanded (since the better-off
were already in school).324 So education
expenditures that expand access are better
targeted to poor people than resources that
exclusively raise quality.
But the quality-quantity tradeoff is not a
simple choice between creating additional
school places or improving instruction. A
major problem for poor children in nearly

every environment is that they drop out of
school with greater frequency, in part because
the quality of the schooling they receive is so
low. So quality improvements need to accompany quantity improvements.
Spending on primary schooling is mildly
progressive, but that on higher levels of education is not. With children from the poorest
households unlikely to reach higher levels of
schooling, and with greater per student
spending at higher levels than at lower, children from richer households capture the bulk
of educational spending. In Madagascar a
single year of higher education costs 20 times
that of primary schooling—and only 3 percent of children completing lower secondary
school are from the poorest 40 percent of
households (table 7.1). Relative cost alone is
not the issue. It is whether funding across levels is equitable and efﬁcient—or driven
exclusively by elite politics.
The political conditions required for adequate budget allocations for education are
not obvious. Simple answers like “democracy” are attractive—but just not true. India,
democratic since independence, has wealth
gaps in education attainment larger than any
other country with comparable data. At least
one empirical study suggests that nondemocratic countries spend more on education.325
But there is a risk that these governments care
not about the quality of education but about
using schools for religious, secular, or
national indoctrination. In countries with
democratic elections, schooling opportunities can be limited and education resources
devoted to patronage and clientelism if
voice is weak and control rests with a narrow elite. Targeting resources to the desti-

tute and disadvantaged has political dangers as well. Systems that focus mainly on
poor citizens, leaving the middle classes no
stake, tend to be ﬁnancially less sustainable
and to experience less pressure for accountability—and so tend to be inefﬁcient and
unconcerned with quality.

Policymakers and organizational
providers: compacts
I do not care that teachers are offended by it. I am
less interested in the teacher’s method of teaching
than in the result she achieves. . . . There should be
a test at the end to see whether the results are being
achieved. . . . Let us who represent the community
say here and now there should be a [test] no matter who may oppose it. . . . If we want to see that a
certain standard is reached and we are paying the
money we have the right to see that something is
secured for that money.
Eamon de Valera, Irish Prime Minister, 1941326

The line separating the state as education policymaker (setting the rules of the game) and
as major organizational provider (running
the school system) is typically blurred. The
minister of education frequently wears both
hats. Often there is no interest in measuring
results, so there is no way of making the public provider accountable for results.
Clarifying objectives and the roles of policymakers and providers is a ﬁrst step. Without specifying desired outputs and outcomes
there is no way to say whether resources are
sufﬁcient (sufﬁcient to do what?) or used
effectively (relative to what goal?). Vague
oversight and vague goals reduce management to compliance with formal rules for
inputs and processes. The resulting lack of
clarity often results in “mission drift” and

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

distracting struggles within the ministry of
education. Lacking a clear mission, the education ministry is often accused of being captured by a teachers’ union rather than representing the collective interest in schooling.
The Irish Prime Minister’s insistence on
testing is a common reaction to the perceived
failure of schools: a temptation to deﬁne the
output of the school system exclusively as test
scores and then to hold schools accountable
for those scores. But accountability too narrowly measured distorts the education system. Only what gets measured gets done.
The strict primary completion examination
brought in so conﬁdently by the Irish government in the 1940s was gone by the 1960s, in
large part because of these concerns.
The compact between policymakers and
organizational providers should create an
environment in which all schools have the
means and motivation to provide high-quality learning. Whether there is public production or government funding of a range of
providers, the compact should focus on outputs and outcomes. This requires a means of
assessing a school’s contribution to the collective objectives of education, and creating
an environment for organizations to innovate and bring those innovations to scale—
school autonomy with accountability.

The use and abuse of accountability
Creating accountability in schooling is difﬁcult. Schooling is discretionary and transac-

tion-intensive. It has multiple outputs that
differ in measurability and in the difﬁculty
of attribution. And it involves a complex—
and not well understood—relationship
between inputs and outputs. High-performance schooling conveys skills, attitudes,
and values. Some steps in this process can
be reduced to a detailed script. And some
aspects of instruction can be replaced by
technology. But face-to-face interaction and
ﬂexibility are crucial to high-quality
instruction. Instructors need to be capable
of exercising discretion—in assessing student mastery, providing feedback, and tailoring the instructional mode to the student
and subject matter. This classroom behavior
is extremely difﬁcult to monitor.
Schooling has multiple outputs—some
easily assessed, others not. Assessing mastery
of simple skills through standardized testing
is fairly straightforward. But it is difﬁcult to
assess how well schooling has conveyed a
conceptual mastery that allows application
to real-world problems. It is still more difﬁcult to assess how well schooling has
encouraged creativity. And it is even more
difﬁcult to assess how well schooling has
conveyed values. Assessing success is further
complicated because different actors assign
different values to different objectives.
Designing an accountability system is
difﬁcult because it is difﬁcult to attribute
speciﬁc outcomes—or even outputs—to
speciﬁc actors. If a 15-year-old has mastered

algebraic concepts, who deserves credit and

The child’s nutrition? The parents’ motivation and efforts? The child’s peers? The
child’s primary school math teachers?
Another teacher who motivated the child to
do well in all subjects? The child’s current
algebra teacher?
Nearly all empirical studies of measured
learning achievement agree that home background accounts for most of the explainable
variation in learning outcomes, especially in
primary grades. The same studies disagree
widely about how much can be attributed to
a child’s school. The recent Programme for
International Student Assessment study
found wide variation in differences in student
performance within or between schools
(table 7.2). Half or more of the variation in
performance across schools was due to variation in students’ socioeconomic status, not to
factors under school control. In poorer countries the effect of schools is larger—and that
of parental background smaller. But, in general, identifying the school’s value added is
not simple.
Even for outputs easier to specify and
measure, not much is known about how
inputs affect them. Economists summarize
this relationship under the metaphor of a
“production function.” Little is known about
this function because instruction involves
human beings—teachers and students—in
all their complexity. For instance, there is
ongoing, vigorous debate about the relevance
of class size for student test scores. Some
assert that class size is irrelevant, or nearly so.
Some assert that reductions in class size have
such a salutary impact on performance that
they are a cost-effective means of improving
performance.327 After more than a century of
widespread use of classroom instruction,
intelligent, well-meaning, and methodologically sophisticated researchers are still debating such a seemingly simple issue. That shows
how truly complex the research questions
are—the results will vary across time, content, and context.

Assessment systems
National assessment systems are essential for
monitoring educational achievement. But performance measurement is as complex as the

many goals societies have for their schools.
Performance measurement is not an attempt
to reduce the output of schooling to the ability
of students to answer questions on standardized examinations. The dangers of test-based
school accountability have been debated for at
least 140 years (box 7.2). You get what you pay
for. But there are also dangers in too little
attention to performance. It is important to
distinguish among the three types of assessment: sample-based assessments to track performance over time, “gatekeeper” examinations that are high stakes for students, and
assessments of school performance.
Tracking progress. One way to strengthen
the compact between policymakers and education providers is to develop measurement
and reporting systems that allow investigation of value for money. Standardized examinations are a relatively inexpensive device for
monitoring progress and effectiveness. But
few education systems in the developing
world have disaggregated the cost of running
a school, and even fewer know how that cost
is associated with learning. So there is almost
no reporting based on such measurements.
The lack of information leads to an inability
to act accordingly.
When the data are revealed, they can be
surprising. One study that generated data
relating expenditures and learning at the

BOX 7.2

Test-based accountability—nothing new under
the sun

Test-based school accountability might
seem like the latest thing. It isn’t. British legislation for school funding in 1862 included
a system of “payments for results.” In addition to a base grant (based on number of
children and attendance), schools received
a grant for each student who passed a
series of tests given by school inspectors in
reading, writing, and arithmetic.
Proponents of the testing argued that
performance-based transfers were only
common sense since public money was
involved. As one parliamentary proponent
reasoned: paying for performance will
either be cheap (because few schools meet
the standard) or expensive (because many
students have high performance)—but it
will not be both expensive and ineffective.
Educational historians claim that the pay-

ments provided teachers (who at the time
had little training) with clear indications of
what was valued and tangible awards for
achievement.
Opponents raised the same arguments
made today.Teachers will “teach to the test”
and ignore subjects not covered by the test
(such as history and geography).Test-based
accountability will lead to teaching methods that emphasize rote memorization and
cramming. One educator argued that “payment for results” would “be remembered
with shame.”
This particular system of “payment for
results” was abolished in 1890. But the
debate continues today.

scores.

school level in Africa found little connection—Mauritanian schools with similar
spending had pass rates of less than 5 percent and more than 95 percent (ﬁgure 7.4).
Needed for active management are
data—on school costs, on the characteristics of students, and on school performance
on cognitive achievement tests. Once
implemented, these sample-based systems
can be gradually scaled up to provide more
census-like measurements.
Gatekeeper examinations. In most countries examinations are seen as a fair way of
allocating limited school places. One study
suggests that the impact on student performance of centralized curriculum-based
examinations is as large as that associated
with differences in parental education or
with substantially more formal education
for teachers (ﬁgure 7.5). Since centralized
examinations make relevant information
widely available, they can be useful for generating accountability.
The impact of public examinations on
the incentives of various actors points to
systemic considerations. For instance,
teacher training programs often attempt to
instill pedagogical techniques that promote
higher-order thinking skills. But when gatekeeper public examinations assess only rote
memorization, teachers frequently revert to
similar methods. And if public examinations have a major impact on students’ life

School-based accountability for examination results. School accountability is controversial—with good reason. There is
empirical evidence that accountability mechanisms based on examination results lead to
“teaching to the test” and to attempts to
manipulate results. Evidence from locations
as diverse as rural Kenya (see chapter 11 and
box 7.5 later in this chapter) and urban
Chicago shows that accountability raised
examination scores—but also that teachers
manipulated the students taking the exam,
and taught to the test.
But teaching to the test is a criticism only
if the test is not a reliable assessment of the
skills that are the objective of public support for schooling—or if the tests divert
teachers from more productive activities,
such as teaching higher-order thinking.
There is a tradeoff between what the test
costs (in design, testing, and scoring) and
how well it captures desired schooling output. Tests in some circumstances could
divert teachers from more productive to less
productive activities, such as “drills.” But in
many cases performance is so weak that
even “less productive” but learning-oriented activities would be an improvement.

There are three important technical
design issues with school-based accountability. First, the characteristics of students,
their peers, and their families are far and
away the largest determinants of variation in
performance. Any attempt to judge schools
on their level of performance will therefore
be judging the socioeconomic composition
of the school—a “good” school might simply have wealthier students. This is true on
average. Some schools serving poorer populations perform well or even very well (ﬁgure 7.6). And some schools with wealthier
students are mediocre.
To focus on school value added rather
than differences based on school populations, scores can be empirically adjusted for
the composition of the student body (box
7.3). Or assessments can measure changes in
student performance (which assumes that
socioeconomic composition is roughly constant). Or a threshold can be set that all
schools—whatever their student composition—are expected to achieve.
A second design issue in school-based
accountability is statistical sampling. In
many schools the number of students is
small enough to result in considerable variability. That means that even schools with
strong improvements over time will have
years when scores are lower than in previous years—simply because of the mix and
number of students. It also means that a
program of rewards or punishments for
performance would disproportionately
reward and punish small schools relative to
large schools. The third design issue is
whether to reward good performance or
intervene in bad performance—or both.

School autonomy
Accountability and autonomy are twins.
Traditional public sector bureaucracies have
little autonomy because accountability is
linked to rules and procedures, which allows
for little discretion. The heads of individual
schools are often bound by process requirements and so have little autonomy to
actively manage their schools—to deﬁne a
mission, choose instructional staff, innovate, or encourage performance. Granting
greater autonomy requires new forms of
accountability based on outputs and out-

comes. The roles of the ministry of education can be unbundled so as to separate education policy from the operation of schools.
A more explicit compact relationship can be
made with organizational providers, perhaps even with multiple providers within
the same jurisdiction. This structure can
give clearer guidance on desired outputs and
outcomes, freeing school heads and teachers
to pursue deﬁned goals.
Nicaragua created autonomous public
schools guided by a school directive council
comprising the school head, elected teachers, parents, and students. The school
retained revenue from students, and the
council could make decisions about personnel, ﬁnance, and pedagogy. The average
school autonomy reported by these schools
was between that reported by traditional
public schools (very little) and private
schools (almost complete). The degree of
self-reported school autonomy was positively correlated with student performance
on test scores at the primary level (though
not at the secondary)—but autonomy on
paper was not. In a study in Chile very little
of the variation (less than 1 percent) in
three measures of self-reported autonomy
of teachers was between the four types of
schools—public, private voucher, private
paid, and Catholic voucher. More of the
variation was between schools of the same

School-based performance awards in Chile

Since 1996 Chile has had an award for “topperforming” schools in each region. Ninety
percent of the award goes directly to teachers (in proportion to their hours of employment), and 10 percent is allocated to the
schools.The awards are given every two
years.
Schools are divided into comparison
groups within each region of the country
based on location (rural, urban), education
level (primary only, secondary with
primary), and socioeconomic status of parents (according to information collected as
part of the examination and an ofﬁcial
“index of vulnerability”). In 2000–01 this
classiﬁcation produced 104 comparison
groups. In this way the performance of poor
rural schools is not compared head-to-head
with that of richer urban schools. Analysis
suggests that this procedure diminishes the

121

correlation between socioeconomic status
and awards.
Next, an index of school performance is
calculated based on standardized tests in
Spanish and mathematics in grades 4, 8,
and 10.The index is weighted for average
test level (37 percent) and improvement in
test scores (28 percent) and includes other
criteria such as “equality of opportunity” (22
percent)—based on student retention and
no “discriminatory practices”—and “initiative” (6 percent)—based on regular development of group pedagogical activities.
The program has been through three
rounds of selection, with 2,520 schools having received awards once, 1,084 schools
twice, and 360 schools in all three rounds.

Two large-scale cross-national assessments
of learning

The Third International Mathematics and
Science Study (TIMSS) created a data set on
student performance and characteristics
and on institutional characteristics of the
schooling system such as use of centralized
examinations and central, local, and school
decisionmaking responsibilities. Analysis of
the performance of more than 266,000 students from some 6,000 schools in 39
(mostly OECD) countries yielded the following conclusions:

• Money cannot buy quality in present
schooling systems.
• Incentives are the key to success.
• Schools should be allowed to decide
autonomously on operational tasks.
• Schools must be made accountable.
• Teachers’ incentives have to focus on
improving student performance.
• Competition between schools creates

incentives for improving performance.

A second study, the OECD Programme
for International Student Assessment,
assessed “young people’s capacity to use
their knowledge and skills in order to meet
real-life challenges, rather than merely looking at how well they mastered a speciﬁc
school curriculum.”The study collected per-

formance data on 265,000 students in 32
(mostly OECD) countries along with information from students and principals about
themselves and schools.The conclusions for
what schools can do to make a difference
were:

• Students’ reported use of school

resources was more closely associated
with performance than principals’ reports
of resource deﬁciencies.

• The ratio of students to teachers matters

where it is high, while in the typical range
there is a much weaker association with
performance.

• Three factors of school policy are associated with better student performance:
school autonomy, teacher morale and
commitment, and other teacher factors
such as expectations.

• Three classroom practices reported by

students show a positive association with
performance: the extent to which teachers emphasize performance, teacher-student relations, and the disciplinary
climate of the classroom.

• Successful students are more likely to do
homework.

type (between 15 and 18 percent), and most
was between teachers in the same school.328
Teacher autonomy in classroom tasks
consistently emerges as a determinant of
success (box 7.4). The principles developed
in chapter 6 are apt: discretion and decisionmaking power need to be delegated to
those with the relevant information and
professional skills. Centralized control of
teacher assignment and assessment can
cause bureaucratic paralysis. But making
schools autonomous in curriculum design,
examinations, assessment, and ﬁnance can
lead to excessive variability across schools.

Innovating, evaluating,
and scaling up
The goal of school autonomy and accountability is to create a system in which organizational providers have strong, sustained incentives to improve outputs. The problem is not
a lack of innovation—there is a continual
stream of new modes of teacher training, new

teaching methods, new instructional inputs,
new use of the latest technology. The problem
is that there is too little systematic learning
from innovation and too little replication of
proven innovations.
The contrasting use of rigorous evaluations in health and education is striking. In
most developed countries no drug can be
used until it is proven safe and effective, and
the standard of proof is the randomized
double-blind clinical trial. But in schooling,
instructional practices for hundreds of millions of children can be changed because a
new technology appears promising. Or
because a group of experts thinks so. Or
because the practice has been tried in a pilot
program (and subject to “Hawthorne”
effects, the nonreplicable impacts that
occur simply as a result of the increased
attention from any innovation). Or because
it has been shown to be statistically correlated with success, subject to all the dangers
of improperly inferring causation. There is
strikingly little use of randomized controlled experiments as a routine management practice—despite its eminent feasibility for many classroom practices (box 7.5).
A recent example of evaluating a schooling innovation illustrates the power of ﬂexibility in design—and the power of evaluation. A remedial education program,
established as a collaboration between the
government and a nongovernmental organization (NGO) in two cities in India
(Mumbai and Vadodara), hired local
women to teach catch-up classes for students who were falling behind. The program
was inexpensive—$5 a child a year. A rigorous evaluation based on the randomized
design of the program found it very effective
at boosting learning, especially among
poorer children. The evaluation showed
that, at the margin, extending the program
would be about ﬁve times more cost-effective than hiring new teachers.329 The program is implemented now in 20 Indian
cities, reaching tens of thousand of children.
But “there is a particular irony to education reform . . . [as] pockets of good education
practice . . . can be found almost anywhere,
signifying that good education is not the
result of arcane knowledge. Yet the rate of
uptake of effective practices is depressingly

Randomized experiments in Busia district, Kenya

Since 1996 a group of researchers has been
working with a Dutch nonproﬁt (International
Christelijk Steunfonds) supporting schools in
rural Kenya to estimate the impact of various
interventions.Through random selection some
schools were chosen to implement the
interventions ﬁrst, with the other schools to follow.This allowed the researchers to test a number of ideas.
Textbooks. Everybody knows that textbooks
are important and that their lack is a major constraint on effective instruction.Yet the ﬁrst study
found “no evidence that the provision of textbooks in Kenyan primary schools led to a large
positive impact on test scores, nor is there any
evidence that it affected daily attendance, grade
repetition, or dropout rates.” Does this mean
that textbooks don’t matter? No. Although textbooks did not increase the performance of the
typical (median) student, they did improve performance for students who did the best on the

pre-test.This suggests that because the
textbooks in this instance were too difﬁcult for
the typical student, the books did not matter.
Teacher incentives. Everybody knows that
teacher incentives are crucial since teachers are
undermotivated.Yet a study on incentives for
teachers based on student test scores found
that “teachers responded to the program
primarily by seeking to manipulate short-run
test scores. . . . [T]eachers’ absence rates did not
decline, homework assignments did not
increase, teaching methods did not change.”
Does this mean that teacher incentives don’t
matter? No.Teachers did change their
behavior—they “conducted special coaching
sessions and encouraged students to take the
test.”This suggests that you get what you pay
for—whether you like it or not.
Deworming. Deworming does not feature
widely in the education effectiveness literature.
Yet a randomized trial of an inexpensive medical

low and effective schools are often found just
a few blocks from dysfunctional ones.”330
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) attempted to refocus its
efforts in education in Africa from “proximate determinants” to a more systemic
approach that focuses on internally driven
identiﬁcation and scaling up of good practices. A recent review of USAID projects
based on systemic reform found, not surprisingly, that implementation was difﬁcult
because it went to the heart of the relationships of accountability among actors in education—and that was intensely political.
Even so, recent work at USAID explores
solutions to the challenges of linking authority, accountability, and transparency to
strengthen basic education through institutional reform. There are several ways of
expanding and scaling up good practice.331
The most obvious way is to use greater
school autonomy—leaving scope for school
management to deﬁne a school mission,
mandate, and tactics—and greater accountability to enable the monitoring of performance. The autonomy and accountability
create incentives to adopt proven successful
practices, to evaluate the effectiveness of
homegrown initiatives, and to create a sense
of pride and commitment in the school.

treatment for hookworm, roundworm,
whipworm, and schistosomiasis found that it
reduced absenteeism by a quarter. Does this
mean that health is all that matters? No. While
attendance improved, test scores did not.
Three observations. First, things that everybody “knows” to be important did not work as
planned, whereas the intervention with lower
expectations had large impacts. Second, these
results from a hundred schools in an isolated
area of Kenya have been getting enormous academic attention because there are so few rigorous, randomized evaluations of schooling interventions.Third, the ﬁndings from each
intervention do not reveal universal,
immediately generalizable results, but they
reveal that speciﬁcs matter and that learning
about what works needs to be local to be useful.

and Kremer (2000); Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin
(1997).

Accountability is, of course, difﬁcult to
deﬁne. Is it accountability within the
bureaucracy (so that policymakers choose
and replace principals based on performance)? Is it the direct participation of parents or school councils in choosing school
management? Is it parental choice?
There are alternatives. One is to allow the
most competent actors (principals, teachers) to run more than one school. This
would allow the more competent to affect
greater numbers of children—and reduce
the sphere of inﬂuence of the less competent. A second way is to systematize a variety of standard-provision models that are
easy to replicate and franchise, whether the
franchise is a bureaucracy or a private
provider. Franchise models should be based
on local research on what capable principals
currently do in a variety of real settings as
well as on citizen dialogue around the
emerging models. Models could also be
based on statistical analysis of the maximum “output” produced by schools, using
the average level of resources that schools
can typically mobilize.
None of these approaches to learning
about learning is possible without assessments of outputs—not just standardized
exams but assessment of all the relevant

outputs of schooling. Nor is any possible
without enough organizational autonomy
for individual schools or groups of schools
to decide how best to act.

Organizational and frontline
providers: management
Managing for effective services means getting people with the right skills and training
in place (capacity). It means giving them
the right infrastructure and inputs to work
with (logistics). And it means ensuring the
motivation (both extrinsic and intrinsic) of
frontline workers. The typical public school
is often handicapped in these endeavors in
nearly every possible way. Individual school
managers often cannot choose their own
teachers and cannot dismiss them—even
for good cause. Teacher training and capacity building are often ill-designed and
poorly integrated, and so become irrelevant. Logistical issues are beyond an individual school’s control—with decisions
centralized and bureaucratic. Compensation structures tend to be tied to seniority
and level of education or training, not to
demonstrated mastery of skills. And
although pay, or other extrinsic motivation,
is not the only motivator for education professionals, the typical structure of working
conditions and pay undermines even the
intrinsic motivation of providers.

Employment relationship
and structure of compensation
There is no single best approach to compensation, capacity building, and classroom
autonomy. Indeed, one of the major beneﬁts of greater autonomy is that it allows
more experimentation and more ﬂexibility
in implementation and replication. With
school autonomy, organizations can try different compensation schemes, training
methods, and modes of parent-teacher
interaction and can evaluate them relative
to output and outcome objectives. If the
public sector can specify what it wants from
a school—a clear compact—it can leave
teacher compensation to school management and let the best system win.
Teacher pay can be too low (where inﬂation has eroded real salaries to the point
where teachers resort to alternative sources

of income) or too high (where pay is several
times higher than needed to attract a quality pool of teachers). But appropriate compensation involves more than the level of
pay. It is the overall attractiveness of the
profession and the structure of compensation that motivate performance.332 Teacher
pay is usually linked to factors that show little association with student performance—
mainly seniority. Teacher earnings thus
exhibit much less variance than earnings of
workers in other occupations. Compensation should reward good teaching, not just
longevity.

Motivation and capabilities
The schooling process is so complex—the
difﬁculties of attribution so severe—that
simple proposals of “pay for performance”
for individual teachers and principals have
rarely proved workable.333 But a total lack of
connection between incentives and performance allows excellent teachers working in
adverse circumstances and those who never
show up to be paid the same amount. This
undermines the morale of good teachers
and drives them out of the profession.
But motivation is affected by more than
money, as a study of teachers in three types of
schools in Merida, República Bolivariana de
Venezuela (nonproﬁts, state, and national),
shows. Catholic Fe y Alegria schools—which
cater to low-income families—emphasize
school autonomy and teacher input in decisionmaking. Even though pay is roughly the
same as in state and national schools, teacher
satisfaction—and student performance—are
much higher (table 7.3).
Enhancing teachers’ capabilities is clearly
fundamental to good-quality schooling, but
experience with teacher training is frequently
disappointing, mainly because of too little
transfer from training to classroom practice.
Teachers need training that lets them do their
job better. But autonomy, motivation, and
assessments of providers (based on outputs
and outcomes) are needed for training to
improve outcomes.

Client power
Client power is a weak force in public
school systems. Channeled into narrow
interests, it has little impact. In nearly all

countries parents can choose schools for
their children, within limits. But choice has
little or no overall impact on school quality
because there is typically no effect either on
schools that lose children or on those that
gain them. Even when parents abandon the
public system and pay for private schools—
as is happening in many countries—little
systemic pressure for change is created
because government resources continue to
ﬂow into public schools. Direct parental
participation in schools is also typically a
weak force since there is little about public
schools that parents can affect. Often the
school head and teachers themselves have
little or no autonomy to make changes. Parent organizations are simply a means of
mobilizing additional resources for the
school.
There are ways to change this, to use client
power to improve outcomes. One is to
involve citizens directly in the assessment and
operation of schools. Another is to use
demand-side subsidies to increase access for
poor people. A third is to make provider
resources depend on client choice—to have
money follow students. None is a panacea,
but each can be part of a strategy for school
improvement.

Direct participation: community
involvement in schools
Since students, and indirectly their parents,
interact daily with the education system, they
have valuable information about provider
performance that tends to be ignored in
purely bureaucratic systems. Several successful experiences with giving parents a formal
role in school governance have heightened
interest in this model:

•

•

•

•

The emergence of community-run
schools in El Salvador showed that they
performed as well in test scores and in student dropout rates as schools operated by
the ministry of education, which catered
to wealthier children (see the spotlight on
Educo).
In Cambodia a donor-ﬁnanced initiative
sought to improve schools by stimulating greater community engagement in
schools and using direct budget transfers
to schools (box 7.6).
Evidence from Argentina supports the
idea that parental participation together
with school autonomy raises student performance.334
NGOs can help both through direct
engagement with communities and
through creating and disseminating information—as in the system of school information for communities in Nepal assisted
by Save the Children-UK.

BOX 7.6

School improvement in Cambodia

To improve school quality, the Education
Quality Improvement Project in Cambodia
uses a participatory approach and performance-based resource management. Operating in three provinces, the project covers
23 percent of the primary school
population. Local school communities identify their needs and make proposals for
change and investment. Funds are delivered
directly to school clusters by the Ministry of
Education.
Change management is supported by
district-based “animators,” who draw general lessons from the experience with the
school’s quality improvement grants to

advise the government on how to improve
its education policies.The animators are
supported by a network of technical assistants at the local level, who provide pedagogical and organizational support.
The project has stimulated lively
dialogue at the school, cluster, and administrative levels on how to improve schools. It
has also set in motion a process of change
in the administration of schooling and in
teaching and learning practices. As a result,
unprecedented responsibility has been
devolved to school and local administrators.

Informal and community schools exist in
many settings, most often when parents take
matters into their own hands and arrange
for teaching outside the formal system. This
is often supported by NGOs and religious
organizations. A recent review of initiatives
in Ethiopia points to the potential of this
support for expanding access to schooling
(box 7.7). The big question is how to link
these efforts to the formal system so that
informal schools are not a dead end.
Greater parental involvement in school
management has its risks. Parents need
access to relevant information and the
power to effect change. Their focus should
be on performance, not on micromanaging
the classroom, where teachers should have
professional autonomy. It is fairly straightforward for parents to assess whether the
instructor is present and not abusive to students. But high-quality teaching cannot be
reduced to scripted actions. Parents often
have a very conservative perspective on

BOX 7.7

Alternate routes to basic education in Ethiopia

Ethiopia is a large country with a heterogeneous population. Education levels are low:
only 24 percent of children complete primary
school.There are very few schools in poor
and remote areas: only about 30 percent of
10-year-olds in rural areas have ever attended
school. But recent innovations sponsored by
NGOs show other ways of getting schools to
these children.
Programs run by six NGOs reveal how
expanding school places is possible even in
remote areas—at reasonable cost and without sacriﬁcing quality.The NGO ActionAid
proposed adapting school models used by
the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee in Ethiopia, and since then several other
NGOs have sponsored similar programs.The
schools share several features:

• Compressing four years of the ofﬁcial
curriculum into three years.
• Streamlining the curriculum to reduce
repetitiveness and remove elements
deemed irrelevant to local needs.

• Using instructional routines that appeal

to children, such as songs or teaching in
groups.

• Scheduling classes on days and times
approved by the community.

• Involving community members in monitoring the attendance of teachers and
students.

• Targeting class sizes of about 35
students.
• Recruiting teachers and teaching assis-

tants from local areas and paying them
less than professional teachers.

• Spending more on textbooks, other

instructional materials, training, and
supervision.

The results are promising. Children
attending these schools continue on to
higher grades. Moreover, learning does not
appear to have suffered.Test scores in the
second grade were about 20 percent higher
than in government schools, and scores in
the fourth grade were only slightly lower,
even though the schools catered to
children from poorer families. All this at a
lower cost per student.
Issues remain, however—particularly
about scaling up these programs to reach
more children, the more so since some initial success was driven by a few energetic
individuals.

teaching methods and will encourage teaching to the test when there are gatekeeper
examinations. Ensuring that the poorest are
not excluded from this process is essential—and difﬁcult. Experience with schoolbased control in South Africa suggests a key
role for training parent groups: without the
training the more advantaged populations
beneﬁted while poorer and less powerful
groups lost out.
Direct participation in schools raises the
difﬁcult issue of user fees and their relationship to community engagement. Some
argue that as long as locally collected fees
are retained by the school, fees are a good
thing, for two reasons. First, empirical
studies suggest that centrally controlled
resources are almost universally devoted
largely to payroll, while resources collected
at the school level raise school quality by
much more than equivalent resources from
higher levels.335 A study in Mali showed that
paying fees left parents better off (on average) because the value of increased school
quality was much larger than the fee
itself.336 Second, if communities are to feel
pride in their school and empowered by
their participation, then parents should be
expected to make some contribution. Payment may come in-kind, such as labor for
construction of the school, rather than as
direct fees for use.
But these potential beneﬁts of greater
community engagement have to be weighed
against the apparently large negative effects
on enrollments of even very low user fees in
poor countries and against the increases in
inequality from relying on fees (see box
4.4). Some might argue the ideal is a compromise of a fairly apportioned fee on communities to generate ownership but with
signiﬁcant exemptions for poor households
(subsidized from a central fund). Recent
experience with such targeting (as in South
Africa) suggests that it is difﬁcult to make
this work.337

Demand-side transfers
Many governments use scholarships or conditional transfers (households receive beneﬁts if children are enrolled) to expand
enrollments. The Education, Health, and
Nutrition Program of Mexico (Progresa)

Basic education services

has drawn considerable attention because—
unusual for this type of effort—it was structured to allow rigorous impact evaluations.
The program has resulted in substantially
higher transitions to secondary school.338 In
Bangladesh a study found that conditional
transfers of rice raised enrollments. The
program was also cost-effective relative to
other interventions, though the government
recently moved to monetize the beneﬁts due
to concerns about leakage.339 Indonesia
introduced a large scholarship program in
response to the economic crisis in 1997. The
program helped maintain junior secondary
school enrollments.340
Conditional cash transfers have proved
effective in expanding enrollments, but they
have shortcomings. They focus on enrollment without creating incentives for
improving quality. To the extent that
demand-side transfers use funds that would
otherwise have been devoted to school
improvement, there is the risk of expanding
quantity at the expense of quality. There
was widespread concern that school feeding
programs in India were “too successful” in
attracting students. Schools were ﬂooded
with underage children not ready for learning, which put even more pressure on quality at the critical lower grades.

Resources and client choice
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(Article 26) asserts that parents have a “right
to choose the kind of education that shall be
given to their children.” Despite this apparent
endorsement of parental choice, there is little
consensus about its role.
In practice, there is a large amount of
choice. A substantial fraction of schooling is
carried out by a range of private providers:
for-proﬁt schools, religious and denominational schools, NGO-operated schools, and
community-owned and -operated schools.
In some countries the proportion of children in private schooling is rising rapidly—
even without public support. In Pakistan
the proportion of urban students in public
schools fell from 72 percent in 1991 to 60
percent in 1996 to 56 percent in 1998—with
most of the shift to private, nonreligious
schools (religious schools accounted for
only 1 percent). Sometimes there is govern-

ment support for these schools—as for
Catholic schools in Argentina or Islamic
schools in Indonesia—or there is support to
parents who choose private schools—as in
Chile, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands,
and New Zealand.
What kind of relationship should governments have with nonpublic providers?
One decision is whether to allow demandside transfers or scholarships to be used in
nonpublic schools. Colombia used scholarship programs for private schools to expand
enrollments for poor students. The fact that
participants were chosen randomly from a
pool of applicants allowed for rigorous
impact evaluation, which found signiﬁcant
positive impacts for scholarship recipients.341 But even though the program was
both targeted and apparently effective, it
was discontinued—for bureaucratic and
political reasons. A second decision involves
more generalized support for nonpublic
schools. In general, it is hard to say anything
about “choice” without provoking controversy, but here are four tries.
General subsidies to private schooling—
neither disaster nor panacea. Although
there is a wide-ranging and still inconclusive
empirical debate about the impact of generalized choice, providing general subsidies to
private schooling has never been a disaster—or a panacea. The Netherlands has had
full school choice among public and
denominational providers since 1920, without terrible repercussions. Chile has had
choice since 1980, and while there is some
controversy about whether it has produced
substantial gains in measured learning outcomes (Hsiao and Urquoila 2002), no one
argues it has been a disaster. New Zealand has
had school choice since 1991, and in a recent
assessment of 32 countries, came in third in
math and sixth in reading and science literacy. The Czech Republic and Sweden have
had public ﬁnancing of private schools since
the 1990s.
So choice is neither an ivory tower
notion that could never work in practice
nor an ideological Trojan horse that would
destroy public schooling. It is also not a
universal remedy. The successful expansion
of choice has nearly always been embedded

in a more general program of school reform
and improvement.
Parents who exercise choice perceive
themselves to be better off. But schooling
transmits beliefs and values, which implies
a distinction between meeting the collective
goals of citizens for publicly ﬁnanced
schooling and satisfying the clients of
schooling. Parents acting as citizens may
want publicly supported schools to encourage all children to be tolerant and respectful
of other people’s beliefs. Yet these same parents acting as clients may want their children to receive instruction in the absolute
correctness of a particular set of beliefs. A
system that satisﬁes every individual parent’s demands as a client might fail to meet
the collective goals of citizens for publicly
supported schools. Doubts about choice
often arise from the impact of schooling on
socialization.342 But this argument cuts
both ways: if socialization is chosen by an
authoritarian government to repress individual or group rights, choice is all the more
important.
Using taxes for private schools requires
accountability. While parents should be
allowed to choose their child’s education
and create their own accountability, using
taxes for private schools requires public
accountability. For choice to be effective in
creating greater accountability, parents
need timely, relevant information. This will
not necessarily emerge spontaneously
because it depends on comparable assessments across schools. Policymakers could
publicize that a speciﬁc school meets minimum standards through easily visible information tools, such as symbols prominently
displayed in the school. A more sophisticated approach could involve broadly disseminated census-like information on outputs and outcomes—perhaps normalized
by socioeconomic status.
Making choice part of a package of reforms.
The public sector always remains an important provider, and choice complements
reforms to improve the public sector. Advocates of school choice emphasize the potential beneﬁcial effects of competition—for
which there is mixed evidence. But there are

other elements as well. Choice as part of a
package of reforms can have three beneﬁts:

•

•

•

The introduction of choice forces an
unbundling of roles. To have effective
choice the government must be explicit
in its dual role of setting the rules for all
providers and managing schools as the
largest provider.
Deciding how to regulate private providers
can force a discussion of the output and
outcome goals of education that can
improve accountability in all schools.
And choice often creates new acceptance of
assessments for monitoring providers—
which can be expanded to all schools.

Designing choice around the politics. Policy decisions about choice are intrinsically
political. The United States prohibits public
support to schools run by religious organizations. Cordoba, Argentina, has actively
supported Catholic schools.343 Holland
explicitly supports both Catholic and
Protestant schools. Rather than being based
on the perceived relative effectiveness of the
different schools, these policy choices seem
to reﬂect differing public opinion at the
time the decisions were taken—for example, historical concern about Catholic inﬂuence among the Protestant majority in the
United States, a predominantly Catholic
population in Cordoba, and a more even
distribution of religions in Holland. Similarly, the suppression of Islamic schools in
some countries and support for them in
others, or the decision to ban private
schools in Pakistan and Nigeria in the
1970s, has little to do with school effectiveness. The promotion of choice through
vouchers in the Czech Republic has been
seen as a reaction to the use of schools for
political indoctrination.
If school choice is a political given, an
effective school system can be designed
around that constraint. If school choice is
politically precluded, an effective school system can be designed around that as well.

Getting reform going
This chapter is about changing the relationships of accountability to produce better
educational outcomes by creating the insti-

tutional conditions for the technically right
things to happen. But how can institutions
be changed? How do openings for reform
get created and exploited? Decentralization
can create opportunities. Reform champions can emerge from political, business,
professional, or parental interests. And
teacher groups can promote—or resist—
change.

Decentralization
Decentralization can be driven by a desire
to move services closer to people. But success depends on how it affects relationships of accountability. If decentralization
just replaces the functions of the central
ministry with a slightly lower tier of government (a province or state), but everything else about the environment remains
the same—compact, management, and
client power—there is little reason to
expect positive change. The assumption is
that decentralization works by enhancing
citizens’ political voice in a way that results
in improved services. But this could go
either way on both theoretical and empirical grounds. Decentralization is not magic.
It must reach the classroom. And it will
work only to the extent that it creates
greater opportunities for school reform
(chapter 10).

Reform champions
Getting education reform on the agenda is
no mean feat, and getting reform politically
supported and implemented is even more
difﬁcult. While individual parents are powerful advocates for their children, that does
not necessarily translate into system
improvement. Educators and progressive
forces among teachers often emerge as
champions of education reform because
they are most acquainted with the problems inside the classroom and school. But it
is much easier to mobilize educator support for certain types of education reforms
(system expansion, increased resources,
pedagogy improvement, technical curricular reform) than others (increased
choice).344
Local or national politicians or technocrats can also be forces for education
reform, particularly if they perceive it is

129

strongly linked to economic performance.
But it is much easier to mobilize technocratic
policymaker support for certain types of
edcuation reform (narrow accountability)
than others (pedagogical improvement).
Teachers and teachers’ unions. Effective
teachers are the backbone of any educational system, but how can the power of
teachers be harnessed for educational
improvement? Some believe that teachers
have too little power, arguing that educational reforms ignore teachers. Followed
through, this view can lead to reforms that
ignore classroom and school-level realities,
further demoralizing teachers and undermining reforms. Others believe that teachers, especially teachers’ unions, have too
much power and focus exclusively on
wages and working conditions (box 7.8).
Both sides can marshal empirical evidence.
Much of the debate stems from the joint
function of teachers’ unions as professional organizations, which exist to promote efﬁcacy, advance professional knowledge, and advocate views in public policy;
and as agents of collective bargaining,
which emphasize resources and working
conditions.

BOX 7.8

Education reform and teachers’ unions in Latin
America

Reforms to promote greater parental
involvement, more school autonomy, more
emphasis on results, and changes in the
training, selection, assignment, and
compensation of teachers are politically
explosive—particularly with teachers’
unions. A study of ﬁve attempts at education reforms that included many of these
elements in Latin America in the 1990s
found that teachers’ unions opposed nearly
all of them—emphatically and stridently.
“Teacher’s unions in Mexico, Minas
Gerais, Brazil, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Ecuador
followed similar strategies in opposing education reform. All used strikes to assert their
power . . . against unwanted changes.The
power to disrupt public life, to close down
schools and ministries, to stop trafﬁc in capital cities, to appeal to public opinion—were
familiar actions to them.” In April 1999 the
announcement by the Bolivian Ministry of

Education of its intention to transfer teacher
colleges to public universities set teachers
and students at those colleges “rioting in the
streets, breaking windows, attacking police,
throwing rocks, and setting cars on ﬁre”
(images the government used to mobilize
public opinion against the unions).
Teachers’unions wanted governments to
address the issues of teachers’wages and
working conditions and were concerned that
decentralization and school autonomy would
intrude on more familiar relationships and
negotiations between a centralized school
administration and a centralized union.
Even when governments pushed
reforms through, conﬂicts with the unions
made implementation problematic, since
successful reform requires teacher participation.

In too many countries discussions
between the government and teachers’
unions are no different from discussions
between a large company and its unions. The
relationship between policymakers and
teachers’ organizations needs to shift from a
pure bargaining game to a positive-sum
game. This is easier said than done. As professional development bodies teachers’ unions

can reinforce professional ethics and mutual
accountability. They can be used to organize
teacher input on technical issues of educational reform, such as assessment, classroom
autonomy, student discipline, and teacher
training. If unions refuse to take on that role,
preferring to concentrate on wages and working conditions, there are no ﬁrm guidelines
for how reformers should cope with that.

Educación con Participación de la Comunidad en El Salvador
By contracting directly with communities, El Salvador dramatically increased the primary school enrollment of children
in poor and remote areas—without reducing the quality of learning.

E

l Salvador was wracked by civil war
throughout the 1980s. Some 80,000
people died—in a total population
of roughly 5 million—and many more were
wounded and disabled. Income per capita
fell almost 40 percent between 1978 and
1983.345 In 1989 the conservative Republican Alliance Party won a majority in the
national assembly, with Alfredo Cristiani as
president. Despite contentious negotiations, a peace accord was signed in January
1992.346
The war had severely damaged the education system. Communication between
the central ministry and schools broke
down, supervision collapsed, and many
teachers, viewed by some as government
“agents” and by others as agents of social
opposition, abandoned their posts. By 1988
more than a third of the country’s primary
schools had closed.347 And by the end of the
war some 1 million children were not in
school.348

Establishing Educo—
Education with the Participation
of Communities
The Ministry of Education quickly identiﬁed expanding access to basic education
and raising its quality as central goals—
both to rebuild national unity and to promote long-term economic development.
Minister of Education Cecilia Gallardo de
Cano, a reform proponent from the “modernizing” wing of the Republican Alliance
Party, was intent on lessening the distrust
between former combatants.
But skepticism was high. The Ministry
of Education was not trusted in many parts
of the country and by organized groups
such as the National Association of Teachers. Expansion of the traditional education
system was viewed suspiciously as a covert
means of reasserting national control and
building political support in oppositiondominated areas.349
During the war many communities had
recruited local teachers and established

community schools, bearing the cost themselves and paying teachers when they could.
The government seized on this model of
community-based schooling as the basis for
a formal program that would be ﬁnancially
and administratively supported by the ministry: Educación con Participación de la
Comunidad, or Educo, with the goal of
encouraging the establishment of preschools
and primary schools, or classrooms in existing schools.
Begun in 1991, Educo targeted 78 of the
country’s poorest rural municipalities (of
221 urban and rural municipalities). By 1993
the program was expanding to all rural
areas, including many areas formerly under
opposition control. But not all of the “popular schools” established during the war were
incorporated into Educo. Some observers
claimed there was selective inclusion based
on political favoritism; others saw not incorporating popular schools into a government
program as a way of sustaining spontaneous
community-based education.350
Each Educo school (or section within a
traditional school) is operated by a Community Education Association (ACE)—an
elected committee made up primarily of
students’ parents—that enters into a oneyear renewable agreement with the ministry. The agreement outlines rights,
responsibilities, and ﬁnancial transfers. The
Ministry of Education oversees basic policy
and technical design. Using the money
directly transferred to them, ACEs select,
hire, monitor, and retain or dismiss teachers. Teachers at Educo schools are hired on
one-year renewable contracts. Parents are
taught about school management and how
to assist their children at home.351

percent of the new students enrolled in
Educo schools (ﬁgure 1). By 2001 there
were almost 260,000 students enrolled in
Educo primary schools, 41 percent of all
students enrolled in rural schools—and
more than 100,000 children enrolled in
Educo preschools, 57 percent of all children
in preschool.
Even as enrollments increased rapidly,
there is little evidence that learning quality
suffered. A survey of 30 Educo primary
schools and 101 traditional schools in 1996
found no signiﬁcant differences in average
math and language test scores among third
graders in the two types of schools.352 A follow-up study in 1998 found that grade promotion and repetition were similar across
the two types of schools as well.353 As the
innovation matured, the institutional
arrangements that it introduced took hold
and ensured rapid expansion of school
places and enrollments of poor children,
seemingly without a substantial cost in
quality.354

Parent visits to classrooms made much
of the difference
That Educo schools served the poorest of El
Salvador’s students, in the poorest areas,
makes these results all the more astonishing. How did they do it? Using retrospective
data that allow controls for child, household, teacher, and school characteristics—

Educo succeeded in many respects. From a
pilot phase of six ACEs in three departments, it scaled up nationally to all of the
country’s departments by 1993. Rural primary enrollments increased from 476,000
in 1992 to 555,000 in 1995—with over 75

that teachers were less likely to be absent in
Educo schools (averaging 1.2 days of
absence a month rather than 1.4 days). Students in Educo schools were also absent less
(three fewer days a month) than students in
traditional schools.356 In addition, Educo’s
more ﬂexible compensation scheme
resulted in greater variability in teacher
earnings, which suggests that parent associations used compensation to motivate
greater effort among teachers.357 Offering
or withholding future employment itself
was an incentive, and one that ACEs used.
Turnover among Educo teachers was high,
which suggests that job loss was not an idle
threat.

and statistically adjusting for the fact that
unobserved abilities of children might systematically differ between the two types of
schools—researchers found that community involvement explains much of Educo’s
success.
Parents are more active in Educo
schools. And their involvement affects
learning (ﬁgure 2). Each classroom visit by
parents was associated with signiﬁcantly
higher math and language test scores
regardless of the type of school. Parents
were more active informally as well: they
were more likely to meet with teachers or to
assist teachers in monitoring attendance or
maintaining school furniture.355
How did Educo and parent involvement
affect test scores? At least part of the story is

Converging with traditional
schools
Educo’s administration has become
embedded in the Ministry of Education,
and Educo has developed into a major
schooling model in the country. Aspects of
traditional and Educo schools have been
converging. Traditional schools now have
more parent participation in school governance and management, and are more
autonomous with supporting block
ﬁnancing. Similarly, the pay packages of
teachers are more similar: Educo teachers
receive the same salaries and beneﬁts as
teachers in traditional schools. Even so, a
key distinction remains: Educo teachers
are hired (and potentially ﬁred) by parent
committees while those in traditional
schools are not.

Is the Educo model applicable
elsewhere?
Educo’s achievements might appear idiosyncratic. The end of a bloody civil war that
had thrown the traditional education system into chaos opened up a unique opportunity to change the way schools were managed. Based in part on coping strategies
during the civil war, El Salvador had a history of community involvement in school
management. Indeed, the community associations appear to have worked better in
places that had prior experience in community organization.358 In addition, in the
aftermath of the war there was an unusually
large pool of educated people without jobs
(coinciding with the rapid expansion of
university places fueled by opening higher
education to the private sector).
These factors suggest that the Educo
model might not be directly replicable in a
different setting. But some lessons are general. First, with political will it is possible to
change the relationships between the actors
in basic education. Second, schools can be
transformed to work in ways that promote
enrollment, participation, and learning—
even for children from the poorest households. Third, getting parents to participate
effectively in managing schools can help
overcome some of the potential pitfalls in
the provision of education services—especially monitoring schooling in remote
areas. Fourth, it is possible to scale up small
innovations to have a signiﬁcant impact on
national outcomes.

Health and nutrition services

8

chapter

Poor people in most countries have the worst
health outcomes. They are pushed further
into poverty due to ill health. And they are
often excluded from support networks that
enhance the social and economic beneﬁts of
good health. Unlike education, health and
nutrition outcomes of poor people are produced by households—with contributions
from many services. And health and nutrition services contribute to other aspects of
human welfare, such as protecting people
from catastrophic health spending. They
should thus be judged by the way they contribute to the poor’s health outcomes, to protecting citizens from impoverishing health
expenditures, and to helping the poor break
out of their social exclusion.
Throughout history, poor people have
often paid health providers directly. But this
short route from client to provider is
blunted by asymmetries of information and
conﬂicts of interest. Another problem: poor
people lack the money for market transactions. A variety of market failures—diseaserelated externalities and fragmented insurance markets—and concerns for equity
justify public intervention in ﬁnancing
health and nutrition services. But governments ﬁnd it difﬁcult to monitor the performance of health workers, especially
those delivering highly discretionary services, such as clinical care. And since insurance-market failures affect everybody, the
non-poor often capture public ﬁnancing of
health care.
Health services are failing poor people
not because of lack of knowledge for preventing and treating illnesses but because
health systems are trapped in a web of failed
relationships of accountability. To break out
of this trap, service delivery arrangements
can be tailored for three classes of services:

•

•

•

Getting highly transaction-intensive and
discretionary individual-oriented clinical services to poor people is most challenging. To inﬂuence quality, poor clients
should have greater power—through
third-party payments, information, and
greater oversight of health workers and
facilities. Organized citizens can exert
this power by contributing ﬁnancial
resources and co-producing and monitoring the services. But insurance market
failures, asymmetries of knowledge, and
conﬂicts of interest mean that governments need to invest in purchasing key
services to protect poor households and
foster a pro-poor professional ethos.
Population-oriented outreach services—
standardized services that can include vector control, immunization, or vitamin A
supplementation—are easier for policymakers to monitor. Even governments
with limited capacity can provide these
services—or write contracts with public
or private entities to provide them. Building coalitions to strengthen poor people’s
collective voice is essential to ensure adequate public resources for those services.
For community and family-oriented
services that support self-care—such as
information and social support for promoting breastfeeding or safe sex—community and civil society organizations
and commercial networks are often well
placed to provide services close to poor
households. Governments can establish
partnerships and provide information
and targeted subsidies.

Policymakers need to be accountable for
health outcomes—which means greater investment in monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that capture disparities in health.359

Ethnicity
and health

In the United States,according to
2000 data,indigenous Americans
and Alaskan Natives have a life
expectancy ﬁve years lower than
that of the general population.Australia’s Aboriginal Health Service
notes that in 1996 life expectancy
was 20–25 years lower for aborigines than for their non-aboriginal
counterparts.In Chocó,Colombia,
where 90 percent of the population is of African descent,the male
infant mortality rate is more than
90 per 1,000 live births,while the
national average is 25 per 1,000.In
Guatemala people born in the capital have a life expectancy 10 years
higher than those born in the
department of Totonicapán,where
more than 96 percent of the population is indigenous.The ratio of
stunting prevalence in indigenous
versus nonindigenous populations
is more than double in Colombia,
Peru,and Ecuador.The 1996 South
African Census reveals that despite
the government’s systematic
efforts,the infant mortality rate was
5.5 times greater among the black
population than among the white
population,a signiﬁcantly larger
disparity than would be predicted
based on income differences.

The health of poor people
Health outcomes improved in the second
half of the 20th century, a trend likely to
continue in many countries. But hopes for
an ever-improving trend are fading as
progress slowed down in the 1990s. At the
current pace most regions of the developing
world will not reach the Millennium Development Goals for health by 2015 (ﬁgure
8.1). Infant mortality rates are increasing in
Central Asia. Under-ﬁve mortality is on the
rise in 22 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Stunting is rising in many African countries
and remains high in South Asia. In 1995,
500,000 women died worldwide as a result
of complications associated with pregnancy,
mostly in developing countries. The AIDS
epidemic is expanding in Africa, India,
China, and Russia, along with a resurgence
of tuberculosis.360 Adult mortality rates have
worsened in the Russian Federation and
some of its neighbors.
The outcomes are consistently worse
among the disadvantaged. In low-and middle-income countries, under-ﬁve mortality
rates are 2.3 times higher among the poorest
ﬁfth of the population than among the richest ﬁfth. Stunting rates are 3.4 times higher
(ﬁgure 8.2).361 The rich fare well in absolute
terms. In Pelotas, Brazil, infant mortality for
the richest 7 percent of the population in
1993 was comparable to the average for the
Netherlands in 1998.362
Communicable diseases, malnutrition,
and reproductive ailments account for most
of the mortality gap between high- and
low-income countries and between the rich

and poor.363 The poor also often suffer from
higher rates of noncommunicable diseases
such as depression and cardiovascular diseases in North America or alcohol-related
ailments in the Russian Federation. Malnutrition is a double burden: poorest groups
have both high rates of malnutrition and
diabetes and obesity.364
Improving health outcomes for the poor
is a complex task. In addition to income,
other household factors inﬂuence health outcomes: age, social status, religion, residence
(chapter 1), ethnic background (box 8.1), and
gender—particularly in South Asia. Girls in
India are 30 to 50 percent more likely to die
between the age of one and ﬁve than boys.365
Maternal mortality depends mainly on health
services while nutrition and under-ﬁve mortality depend on many other services, such as
education, water, food security, communication, electriﬁcation, and transportation. The
AIDS epidemic has particularly challenged
policymakers and providers to look at links
with other sectors and focus more on behavior and societal values.

Health services can work
for poor people
Experience from Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica
and Cuba (spotlight), Iran (box 8.2), Nepal,
Matlab (Bangladesh), Tanzania, and several
West African countries (spotlight) shows
that health services, if delivered well, can
improve outcomes for even the poorest
groups. A health program in the Gadchiroli
district in India reduced neonatal mortality
rates by 62 percent. Midwifery services and
community hospitals are linked to dramatic
reductions in neonatal and maternal mortality in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. In Uganda
and Thailand government efforts changed
sexual behavior, reducing the prevalence of
HIV. In low- and middle-income countries
services promoting oral rehydration therapy
led to a decrease in diarrhea-related child
mortality.366
Health services also help protect the income
of the poor. Locally managed ﬁnancing
schemes in Niger, contracted-out services in
Cambodia, and insurance schemes targeting
poor people in Thailand and Indonesia helped
reduce out-of-pocket spending and extended
the reach of the safety net among the poor.367

Health and nutrition services

Health services, when they work, can also
contribute to greater self-reliance and social
inclusion of poor people. They have been used
as entry points to broader development activities, as in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
where community health ﬁnancing schemes
triggered the emergence of cooperatives to
commercialize agricultural products.368

But those who need the most often
get the least . . .
Despite these successes the availability of good
health services tends to vary inversely with
need.369 Poor groups and regions have less
access to sanitation and vector control.370 An
analysis of 30 countries shows that the use of
health care interventions is consistently lower
among people living on less than $1 a day than
among richer groups (ﬁgures 8.3 and 8.4).

. . . pay the most . . .
Illness pushes households into poverty,
through lost wages, high spending for catastrophic illnesses, and repeated treatment for
other illnesses. The share of household nonfood expenditures spent on health is higher
among poorer than richer groups. Patients
sell assets to ﬁnance health care, as 45 percent of rural patients do in the Kyrgyz
Republic.371 Health expenses are estimated to
have pushed almost 3 million Vietnamese
into poverty in 1998. Out-of-pocket spending pushes poor households deeper into
poverty, but it also pushes households that
were not poor into extreme poverty. The
poor seldom enroll in voluntary insurance
schemes and rarely beneﬁt from compulsory
schemes. Even when they do, they still incur
signiﬁcant direct health care costs in the
form of insurance premiums, copayments,
and payments for noncovered services.372

. . . and lack the power to produce
good health
Poor nutrition practices, careless handling of
water and waste, and inadequate care for illness are major contributors to poor health.
Illiteracy, women’s ignorance of health issues,
and lack of decisionmaking power are often
the causes (ﬁgure 8.5).373 Studies of the richpoor gap in health outcomes show that the
poor and the non-poor may respond to the
same level of inputs differently.374 In Senegal

the poor are 39 percent less efﬁcient than the
rich at translating drinking water, sanitation,
and health services into better health. In Mali,
the poor are only 16 percent less efﬁcient, but
the gap has been widening over time: while
the availability of inputs is increasing, poor
households’ ability to transform those inputs
into health is lagging behind.

BOX 8.2

Making health services work for poor people in
the Islamic Republic of Iran

In 1974 the infant mortality rate in Iran was
120 per 1,000 live births for rural areas and
62 in urban areas. By 2000 it stood at 28 for
urban areas and 30 for rural areas. Maternal
mortality rates dropped in rural areas from
370 per 100,000 to 55 between 1974 and
1996. Immunization rates, treatment of child
illnesses, and antenatal care increased dramatically and are now at comparably high
levels in rural and urban areas, although
skilled attendance for deliveries remains
lower (75 percent) in rural areas than in
urban (95 percent). All this, despite the fact
that 76 percent of rural children had no
health insurance in 1997 and 56 percent of
rural women were still illiterate.
How did this happen? In 1980, after the
Iranian revolution, a new constitution
bound the government to provide basic
health beneﬁts to the “disadvantaged”
(mostazafeen).The most immediate concern
was to increase access to care in rural areas.
Allocations of resources for rural services
increased and today are about a third of the
health budget in the rural regions. By March
2002 there were 16,340 rural health houses,
each covering about 1,500 people, serving

about 84 percent of rural communities.The
rest were covered by mobile teams. Health
centers offering emergency obstetrical care
24 hours a day (three midwives) and transport for referral were created covering
about 20,000 people each.
Despite the large number of medical
professionals in Iran, stafﬁng these facilities
was a challenge because personnel did not
readily accept posting to rural areas.The
health houses were therefore staffed by
female and male health workers known as
behvarz. Selected from the villages where
they were to be stationed, with the participation of village authorities, the behvarz
were required to have eight years of formal
schooling.Their training lasted two years,
was mainly local, and consisted of on-thejob training with supervisors and peer trainers. A simple health information system—
the Vital Horoscope—enabled behvarz to
identify families with child and maternal
health problems and link them with health
services.

Market failures
and government failures
Market failures and a concern for equity call
for some government ﬁnancing of health
and nutrition services. One type of market
failure is the underprovision of services to
prevent or treat individual illnesses that spill
over to the general populace. Another is the
breakdown in insurance and credit markets,
impoverishing people.375 The concern for
equity is either a social choice or based on
the notion that health is a human right (see
box 2.2).
Conﬂicts of interest and the capacity of
services to do serious harm also justify government involvement in service provision.
Patients ﬁnd it difﬁcult to attribute their

health status to a speciﬁc course of action.
This makes them imperfect judges of health
providers. Although responsiveness to
patients’ needs is often better in the private
sector, the technical quality of private services varies broadly from very good to very
bad (chapter 4). The technical complexity of
clinical services confers considerable power
on providers to inﬂuence the nature and
quantity of services they provide—to their
own ﬁnancial beneﬁt. This is well illustrated
by recent increases in caesarian sections in
both high- and low-income countries.376
Governments often aim at solving conﬂicts of interest through direct service provision with tight administrative control and
enforcement of a public ethos. But monitoring whether services are actually delivered
and of adequate quality may be difﬁcult.
These “bureaucratic” failures are particularly high for highly discretionary and transaction-intensive services such as diagnosing
and treating an illness. Absenteeism rates in
health clinics is high377 (chapter 1) and
although technical quality of services is
often slightly better in public than in private
services, quality shortcomings are still rampant in the public sector. In Tunisia in 1996
only 20 percent of pneumonia cases were
managed correctly and 62 percent of cases
received antibiotics inappropriately.378
Governments also address failed insurance markets by running “free” public hospitals. The beneﬁciaries of these hospital
services are usually the non-poor in urban
areas (chapter 2). They use their political
clout to ensure that public spending for
these (expensive) hospitals is maintained—
often at the expense of services that could
have a real effect on poor people.
Many health services are private goods,
and all countries have a private health care
market. Most industrial countries started
with private health systems. In low- and
middle-income countries out-of-pocket
spending represents a large share of health
spending even in countries with wellfunctioning public systems (ﬁgure 8.6). And
in the last 20 years there has been tremendous
growth in private provision (often uncontrolled) and private spending on health.379
Worldwide, richer groups generally
resort more to the private sector, but the sit-

also use public facilities more—which indicates that subsidies are not well targeted.
The public-private mix varies by type of

health. But immunizations, family planning, and skilled delivery care are more

India, poor people, who turn mainly to private providers to treat illnesses, rely on the
public sector for vaccination (93 percent)
and antenatal care (74 percent).380
The boundaries between public and private services have blurred. Many governments subsidize privately provided services—all high-income countries do and so,

increasingly, do middle- and low-income
countries, as in the Thai Social Security
Scheme, Poland’s social insurance system,
and Uganda’s subsidies to not-for-proﬁt providers. Many public facilities charge user fees,
introducing a market-like transaction in the
delivery of public services,381 and poor people spend substantial sums to use them.382
There has also been widespread growth in
informal payments to public providers in
Africa, East Asia, and Eastern Europe,383
which represents an informal marketization

of public services. Informal payments boost
the cost of “free” maternity care in Bangladesh
to $31 for a normal delivery—a quarter of a
household’s average monthly income—and
to $118 for a caesarian section.384

Applying the framework:
classes of services
Chapters 3 through 6 developed a framework for analyzing service delivery that identiﬁes two routes for poor people to obtain
services. One is the short route, where clients

17_WDR_Ch08.qxd 8/14/03 9:47 AM Page 139

Health and nutrition services

exert power over providers by dint of their
money and ability to enforce discipline. The
other is the long route of public accountability from poor clients to policymakers, and
from policymakers to providers. For health
services, the short route often fails because of
conﬂicts of interest and asymmetries in
information. Poor people also lack money
for market transactions. But the complexity
of services and the heterogeneity of health
needs make it difﬁcult to standardize service
provision and to monitor performance—a
major “bureaucratic” failure of the long
route of accountability. Lack of voice of the
poor in decisions over the use of the collective purse is another failure of the long route.
Clinical services are highly discretionary
and transaction-intensive, requiring individually tailored diagnostics and treatments.
So one leg of the long route, which requires
the policymaker to monitor the provider, is
difﬁcult. Yet failures in the insurance market
call for government involvement in highcost services, such as inpatient services or
catastrophic illnesses. But often these government-ﬁnanced, high-cost services beneﬁt primarily the non-poor. So the other leg
of the long route (voice) also fails. This
means that poor people have to revert to the
short route of direct client purchases of a
service. But the asymmetry of information
between the client and the provider—and
the client’s lack of money—cause this route
to fail too. A quandary!

BOX 8.3

139

The task is slightly easier for services that
support self-care by families and communities, such as information to support changes
in nutritional or sexual behavior. This service is discretionary because it has to be tailored to the family’s social environment, but
it requires less intensive professional transaction than services responding to individual illness. Short- and long-route failures
are small.
Some professional services, despite being
technical and transaction-intensive, are also
well standardized and less discretionary.
Such services include those that serve homogeneous needs of a population—such as vector control, immunization, supplementation
with vitamin A, or screening for diabetes.
These population-oriented services can be
delivered through outreach to the poor.
When health interventions have large externalities such as communicable diseases control, the short-market-like route is unlikely
to work. If technology allows standardization, this delivery arrangement is then the
prime choice as policymakers can monitor
performance and tightly control delivery.
Technology is constantly evolving, and no
intervention belongs automatically to one
category (box 8.3). Service delivery approaches are continually being developed
that reduce the need and difﬁculty of monitoring for both government and citizens.
Countries have standardized highly technical
interventions into less discretionary services

The changing mix of cure and care: who treats what, and where?

Throughout the 20th century, service institutions
have responded—albeit slowly—to rapid
changes in health technology. Countries choose
combinations of “delivery modes”based on costs
and international standards but also on countryspeciﬁc characteristics such as geographic and
density constraints, transport and infrastructure
capacity, existing health infrastructure inherited
from previous technological innovations, labor
market characteristics, training and orientation of
providers, and so forth.What is delivered as inpatient treatment, outpatient hospital, health center
or home visits; and what by lay people, nurses,
general practitioners, or specialists is far from
being standard across countries.

required. Hospital tuberculosis treatment
(the sanatorium) was replaced by outpatient
clinical care—thanks to antibiotics . Screening followed by treatment—DOTS (Directly
Observed Treatment Therapy)—were later
standardized to allow delivery through community outreach. Similarly, new treatments
for HIV and cancer cut lengthy hospitalization requirements. The care and cure
functions of the hospital also evolve. Hospitals are being transformed into long-termcare centers for the elderly, while complex
procedures are increasingly conducted in
ambulatory clinics. Home-based nursing care
is being revived.

• Technological progress triggers modiﬁcations
in the nature, type, and quantity of services

• At similar levels of technology countries have
opted for different models with comparable lev-

els of success. Independent practitioners
developed ﬁrst in Western countries and have
been the cornerstone of Western systems.The
hegemony of hospitals in the Western world
is no older than the 20th century. In contrast,
hospitals have played a much larger role in
the provision of outpatient care in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia, and in Latin America,
Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. In Africa health systems developed through hospitals and
mobile clinics since the beginning of the 20th
century, with primary health care emerging
only in the 1980s. Different skill levels are also
used for similar interventions. Health technicians and nurses have been successfully used
in Mozambique to perform caesarian
sections, while other countries use general
practioners or skilled obstetricians.

that can be initiated, controlled, and delivered by the government through reaching
out to the poor. Such interventions can be
addressed to population groups with similar needs. Another way is to reduce the
transaction intensity of services—and the
need for government monitoring—by
empowering poor people to drive services
that correspond to their needs and characteristics (ﬁgure 8.8).
Table 8.1 presents some of the key obstacles limiting the coverage of the poor with
regard to health and nutrition services.
Poor access to information and to networks
distributing health-related commodities is a
major impediment to the use of community- and family-oriented support to selfcare. Rural populations often have no access
to retail condoms, soap, water containers or
bed nets. If they do, price remains a barrier.
Fewer than 30 percent of the poorest ﬁfth of
the population have access to the media in
such countries as Bolivia, India, Morocco,
and Mozambique. Few poor households
receive extension workers, with visits peaking at 20 percent of Indonesian and Peruvian households .
Most countries have had some success in
increasing the physical access of poor communities to some population-oriented ser-

vices—witness the universal childhood
immunization, polio eradication efforts,
and the elimination of onchocerciasis.
Egypt and Mexico have successful itinerant
clinics. But sustaining these efforts for the
poor is problematic. Low demand and poor
quality reduce effectiveness of family planning services in India. Governments can
control and monitor such services easily,
but they often underinvest in them. In transition countries in Europe and Asia, moving
from publicly provided services to social
insurance led to confusion about the government’s role in health, which led to the
neglect of these services and the subsequent
re-emergence of communicable diseases.
Low-income countries have difﬁculty
ensuring physical access to clinical services
for a large part of their population. In Chad
only 20 percent of the poorest ﬁfth live less
than one hour from a health facility. Middleincome countries have more trouble ensuring affordable and quality care to excluded,
vulnerable, and difﬁcult-to-reach segments
of the population. Inequitable risk pooling
still leaves the poor exposed to the ﬁnancial
risk of illness in most of these countries.
Studies report large inefﬁciencies in the way
health facilities are run. In Turkey, a study
found that only 54 of 573 general hospi-

tals—public and private—could be considered to be operating efﬁciently.385
With a broad variety of situations and
problems, the key issue is to ﬁnd a balance
in the public-private mix to minimize the
consequences of both market and government failures in ﬁnancing and providing
services. Increased resources for health services will translate into better results for the
poor only if used to address the country-

speciﬁc obstacles to service delivery (box
8.4). This clearly requires deﬁning the
accountabilities of those involved and
ensuring that there are sufﬁcient resources,
information, and enforcement mechanisms
to make the relationships work. The mix of
client power and government action will
need to differ according to the nature of services, the country, its institutions, and its
government.386

BOX 8.4

Buying results to reach the Millennium Development Goals (continued)

Budgeting approaches often don’t link the money
spent with the expected results.The impact of
public funds invested in health services and their
contribution to the Millennium Development
Goals are thus difﬁcult to assess. Budgeting the
contribution of health and nutrition services to
goals should address three questions:
1. What are the major bottlenecks hampering
the delivery of health services, and what is the
potential for improvement?
The analysis of the determinants of the baseline
coverage of interventions in terms of availability
of critical resources (human and material), physical accessibility, demand (utilization of the services), and continuity and quality of health services helps identify the main constraints to the
increase in coverage.
In Madagascar the bottlenecks of clinical care
are mainly low quality, utilization, and human
resource availability. Increasing the demand for
clinical services (scenario 2) especially the use of
health facilities or skilled health workers for the
treatment of severe respiratory infections (scenario 1) could raise the effective coverage of this
intervention to almost 60 percent.The potential
for improving the availability of health staff in
poor rural areas (scenario 3) is limited, and this

determines a real-life “coverage frontier” (at 80
percent). In Ethiopia the coverage with at least
one dose of DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus
vaccine) in relation to the geographical access is
the main bottleneck, while the dropout between
the ﬁrst and third dose of DPT constitutes
another obstacle to adequate coverage with
outreach services. Increasing the use of immunization services through information and communication (scenario 2) as well as defaulter
tracking (scenario 1) can increase the adequate
coverage to over 80 percent. In Madhya Pradesh
in India, late initiation and non-exclusiveness of
breastfeeding (BF) are the main bottlenecks
identiﬁed in self-care. Increasing the use (early
initiation of BF, scenario 2) and quality (exclusiveness of BF, scenario 1) of healthy home practices
through information and the creation of a supportive environment can increase effective coverage to nearly 80 percent.
2. How much money is needed for the expected
results?
Once coverage bottlenecks and the potential for
improvement (coverage frontiers) have been
identiﬁed for each mode of health services
delivery, the cost of the strategies can be calculated using country-speciﬁc data.This allows the

preparation of investment and recurrent budgets that speciﬁcally support strategies most
likely to improve efﬁciency of demand (scenario
1), support increased demand (scenario 2), or
increase access to health services and availability of health staff (scenario 3).This enables Ministries of Health and Finance to determine the
spending needed to support the goals and to
encourage policymakers to ensure funding of
priority activities that address the major coverage bottlenecks.
3. How much can be achieved in health
outcomes by removing the bottlenecks?
The increase in coverage in speciﬁc
interventions achievable through well-targeted
strategies and budgets such as those deﬁned
above can be converted into measures of
improved health outcomes using various epidemiological models. Preliminary analysis can
show the reduction in under-ﬁve mortality rate
that can be expected from removing the bottlenecks of clinical care, outreach services, and selfcare in Madagascar, Ethiopia, and Madhya
Pradesh, India.

Strengthening client power

Paying for services confers power

These are our people. This is our money, you cannot touch it.
President of Benin’s Health Committees,
responding to the Ministry of Health’s
attempt to centralize community-owned
health funds and return them
to the Treasury

The poor often ﬁrst use the commercial sector to purchase key commodities for
improving health. In Colombia and Mexico
community cooperatives distribute insecticide-treated bed nets. In more than 40 countries social marketing programs have relied
on market incentives. They have increased
the use of bed nets, condoms, contraceptives, soap, and locally produced disinfectant
for water treatment (which has reduced the
risk of diarrhea by 44 to 85 percent).387
Modest copayments can also provide an
entry ticket to clinical services for poor people by reducing capture of supposedly free
services by richer groups (box 4.4). Controlled studies in several countries388 ﬁnd
improvements in the use of services among
poor people after copayments increased the
transparency and accountability of providers to poor clients (ﬁgure 8.9). But to be
pro-poor copayments need to be retained
locally and tied to performance, and they
need to contribute to the income of providers rather than compensate for inadequate public funds (chapter 4).

Strengthening client power can improve
services for the poor by substituting for or
correcting the weaknesses of the long route
of accountability. Throughout the world,
poor people are engaged as purchasers, coproducers, and monitors of health services.
For poor clients to have more control over
health providers means:

•
•
•
•

Making the income of health service
providers depend more on demand from
poor clients.
Increasing the purchasing power of the
poor.
Fostering the involvement of poor people
in co-producing and monitoring services.
Expanding consumer power to use complaint and redress mechanisms.

Yet for many services the purchasing
power of poor people remains insufﬁcient
to overcome price barriers (table 8.2). Marketing programs for condoms are unlikely
to be pro-poor in the early stages, and a
focus on cost recovery excludes the
poorest.389 Governments can then provide
subsidies, as is often done for food to
address malnutrition. The subsidies may
need to be very high to substantially
increase use among poor people, as demonstrated in the programs to distribute free
condoms to sex workers390 and to offer bed
nets as part of antenatal care.391 Market segmentation, tier pricing, and product differentiation can be helpful. In Malawi, highly
subsidized bed nets for pregnant women
differ in color and shape from regular market-priced nets.392 Cross-subsidizing preventive and maternal and child health services using the margins on fees for adult
clinical care made the ﬁrst more affordable
in Bolivia.393
Direct transfers to client households—
demand-side subsidies—can also boost
client power. Vouchers have a good record in
promoting use of some well-deﬁned services. Food stamps can increase food consumption.394 In Honduras and Nicaragua
families receive ﬁnancial stipends under the
condition that they use key preventive health
services.395 Financial support through
vouchers for consultations reduced sexually
transmitted diseases for sex workers (box
8.5). And poverty funds ensured third-party
payments for the poor in China.396 How the
subsidies are managed matters, however. In
Tanzania, the poor pregnant women targeted
by the bed net program almost never used
the vouchers, probably because the subsidies
were too low.397

A problem with subsidies is how well
they reach the poor. Thailand’s low-income
insurance scheme has used demand-side
subsidies—health cards—for clinical services, but about a third of the beneﬁciaries
were not poor and half the poor did not
beneﬁt.398 Demand-side subsidies also have
limits if provided in isolation. Even welltargeted food-related transfer programs seldom have measurable impacts on malnutrition unless accompanied by programs to
promote breastfeeding, complementary
feeding, hygiene, and care of childhood illnesses. In Mexico the success of the Education, Health, and Nutrition Program (Progresa—see spotlight) was made possible by
a parallel program of itinerant health
teams.399

Coproducing health services
Self-care is a particularly important type of
service co-production, relied on by poor
and rich alike, and more common in industrial countries than the use of professional
services. Support to families and communities can help poor communities reduce malnutrition, as in East Asia where communitybased programs were linked to service
delivery structures, often village outlets for
primary health care. Government employees were trained as facilitators of nutritionrelevant actions coordinated and managed
by volunteers selected by local communities.
In Honduras the strongly communityowned AIN-C program reduced severe
malnutrition by 31 percent. Civil society
organizations can serve as intermediaries
between clients and providers. Women’s
support groups have helped spread the practice of exclusive breastfeeding in Africa and
Latin America. Other successes include
greater use of oral rehydration solutions,
better environmental health, and better
AIDS interventions.400
Communities are often involved in building health facilities. But they have also taken
over provision and management of professional health services, as in the more than
500 community-led health clinics in Peru,
which cover more than 2 million people.401
Cooperative pharmacies have sprung up in
Haiti, Nigeria, and Singapore. The availability of high-quality drugs has been improved

through client-controlled revolving funds in
Mongolia, Vietnam, and West Africa and
through Ethiopia’s special pharmacies. Particularly resilient to crisis, these efforts can
be a source of stability and sustainability. In
the Democratic Republic of Congo zones de
santé continued to provide immunization
through community-managed services after
more than two decades, without state or
donor support.402
Client ﬁnancial and managerial control
over health staff—the power to hire and
fire—can help ensure that services are
actually delivered. In Mali user associations
hire and pay professional health staff serving more than 6 million people (spotlight
on the Bamako Initiative). There, as in
Peru, provider attendance is high, with
strong local ownership of community centers. But the approach can have problems.
The relationship between communities and
health personnel can become antagonistic,
requiring state intervention to arbitrate
disputes. And the right of local health
boards to hire and ﬁre staff may mean little
in countries facing severe human resource
shortages. In Zambia during the health
reform most districts hired the staff already
working in the health facilities. In Mali the
shortage of nurses made recruitment difﬁcult, loosening the control of clients over
frontline providers.403
Solidarity mechanisms to protect
socially and economically disadvantaged
groups by pooling ﬁnancial resources can
strengthen communities in their negotiations with health care providers. Microinsurance schemes for health have been
linked to such traditional modes of selforganization as rotating savings—as with
abotas in Guinea-Bissau and traditional
community schemes in the Philippines.404
In Germany and the Republic of Korea,
small, not-for-proﬁt insurance societies
became independent purchasers of health
services, contracting with public and private providers.405 The proximity of these
schemes to their insured members allows
effective monitoring. But the risk pool’s
small size makes them very vulnerable. Reinsurance can help,406 but the added complexity can lead to the same managerial and
governance problems in large-scale public

Vouchers for sex
workers in Nicaragua

A voucher program has been operating in
Managua, Nicaragua, since 1995, with the
objective of increasing the use of reproductive health services by female sex workers.
The vouchers entitle the sex workers to free
services at selected for-proﬁt, NGO, and
public clinics.The clinic turns the voucher in
to the voucher agency, which reimburses
the provider at an agreed-upon fee per

voucher.The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases among sex workers who used
the vouchers dropped by 65 percent in the
ﬁrst three years of the program. Vouchers
are now available to the clients of sex workers and their partners.

provision. The transparency of direct community control is lost. Scaling up would
then be the kiss of death.

Information and monitoring
One of the strongest levers for strengthening client power is information, a critical
instrument for changing self care behaviors.
Under government leadership in Thailand,
messages on AIDS were broadcast every
hour during the peak of the epidemic. But
behavior change is possible only when
grounded in an understanding of cultural
norms and the links between behavior and
disease—and when local actors are
involved. Community-based nutrition programs have often improved nutritional status through information exchanges, as in
Tamil Nadu, India. In addition to giving
women greater control over resources, the
microcredit programs of the Bangladesh
Rural Action Committee also increased
knowledge.407
Clients can exert more leverage on
providers by participating in decisionmaking and by monitoring some aspects of service delivery. Community monitoring of
health service performance in Bolivia and
Vietnam raises community awareness of
key demand-side barriers and helps ensure
that services meet community needs. Civil
society representatives are also part of
health boards in New Zealand. These
approaches increase the transparency of
management. But these health boards also
remain vulnerable to capture by local elites
unless institutional mechanisms ensure the
representation of disadvantaged clients
(chapter 5).408

insurance, with egalitarian beneﬁts. But this
is often difﬁcult to implement in developing
and transition countries with weak taxation
capacity (in China the proportion of gross
domestic product collected by the state fell
from 30 percent in 1980 to 10 percent in
1999).Taxes in low-income countries are
also often regressive.
An alternative is for governments to
subsidize insurance for the poor, using
income-related sliding scales for premiums
and copayments. Income-related contributions were successful in promoting equity in
Israel and in the Gomoshasthaya Kendra
community ﬁnancing scheme in
Bangladesh. Governments can also develop
speciﬁc schemes for the poor, as was
successfully done in Indonesia and
Thailand. Both approaches require some
means testing and the adequate and timely
compensation of providers. And leakages
are to be expected.

cholera, and leprosy. But the state as the main
actor in health emerged only in the 20th century, starting in centrally planned systems—
the Soviet Union and others—and then
spreading to Western Europe after World War
II, with the government as unchallenged
leader of the formal health system. Many
developing countries have followed, with
health services being part of the social contract between the (often) newly independent
states and their citizens. The model was not
always successful—witness the remaining
health gaps between poor and rich in middleand low-income countries. But some countries—Brazil, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Costa
Rica (chapter 1)—have done better than others in making the long route of accountability
work for poor people by:

Making health insurance work for poor people

Copayments are not always regressive (see
chapter 4), and prepayment and insurance
are not inherently pro-poor. In Tanzania’s
Community Financing Funds, poorer
groups’ copayments subsidized care for
wealthier insured groups.The poor enroll in
voluntary health schemes in small numbers,
as in Cameroon, Ghana, and Rwanda—and
in smaller proportions than richer groups, as
in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Guinea, and Senegal. Employment-based
social insurance systems have been
observed to beneﬁt richer groups most in
Latin America and Africa. A review of Asian
community ﬁnancing schemes concluded
that equity was low. Matching grants for
insurance premiums are often captured by
the local elites, as in Thailand during the
early days of the health card.The grants
sometimes simply lead richer groups to
substitute private care for public services.
One way for governments to provide
income protection to the poor is through
progressive taxation or payroll-based social

Enforcement and regulation
Legal and other dispute mechanisms—
ombudsman services, the judicial system, and
pressures on professional associations—can
enforce provider accountability. But there is
little proof that such mechanisms work in
favor of the poor. A study in the United States
in 2000 found that 97 percent of people with
negligent injury did not sue. Better-off clients
went to court, while poor clients did not. In
India women from lower castes were less
likely to use consumers’ courts. Seventy-six
percent of Indian doctors believed the Consumer Protection Act to be only moderately
effective because of weak enforcement and
resistance from professionals. Sanctions are
often a weak threat, because health providers
tend to protect one another, and accountability channels do not favor poor clients. Rampant corruption in the legal system of many
countries also works against poor people.409

Which services and for whom?
How do we know if voice works for poor
people? There is no conclusive evidence that
either one of the main resource-generation
mechanisms for health services emanating
from collective action—social insurance
(Bismark model) or general taxation (Beveridge model)—works better for the
poor.410 To be pro-poor they both require
some level of cross-subsidy—through
either differential premiums or progressive
taxes. More than prepayment, third-party
payment—whether through insurance or
other solidarity funds—is what makes the
difference for poor people (box 8.6).
There is also no clear answer on whether

Key questions

Evidence

Problems

Is there a constitutional or legislative commitment
to guarantee some level of health service to all?

• Most countries have constitutions that express
some commitment to universal access or rights to
health care. Few have an expressed commitment to
the poorest segments of society. Rights-based
arguments such as the Special Session For Children
of the United Nations General Assembly can provide
legal grounds for claiming access to services.
• With the exception of Mexico, Turkey, and the
United States, all OECD countries today offer their
populations universal protection against the cost
of illness.

• Lack of prioritization or targeting gives the non-poor
incentives to seek more services or shift from
private to public providers.
• The distribution of health resources is inﬂuenced
by more vocal and often urban populations and is
concentrated in a highly visible urban hospital
infrastructure, as in Nepal. With the exception of a
few countries (e.g., Costa Rica, Malaysia), public
spending on health care often disproportionately
beneﬁts the non-poor (chapter 2).

Are the diseases that affect the poor priorities for
public action?

diseases that affect the poor most.
• Epidemiological proﬁle often polarized between rich
and poor.

Are services that are close to the poor given
priority?

• Beneﬁt incidence studies show primary health
care to be signiﬁcantly more pro-poor than
hospital-level care.

• Primary care also beneﬁts richer groups more in
many countries.

Do disadvantaged areas beneﬁt as much or more
than richer areas?

• Population and needs-based funding increase the
health funding for poor groups. Brazil led richer
states such as Parana to have their share reduced
to the beneﬁt of poorer states in the Northeast.

• The wealthiest areas often receive larger
government subsidies than poorer regions, as
documented in Bangladesh, the Kyrgyz Republic,
Mauritania, Mozambique, Pakistan, and Peru.
• Political resistance to equalization.

Do children, women, and the elderly beneﬁt from
public services?

• Thailand’s exemption policy for children and the
elderly has been largely successful. Mozambique’s
exemption for treatment of illnesses in children at
the primary care level has been partially successful:
65 percent of children were exempted.

• Poor children and poor women may not be reached.
And services leave out poor male adults, whose
welfare indirectly affects the welfare of children and
women.

Do individual households beneﬁt from speciﬁc
protection measures?

• Exemptions can be effective when funds are
available to compensate providers, as in the insurance
fund in the Kyrgyz Republic or the Type B scheme in
Thailand. Ghana’s program of fee exemptions for the
poor was initially successful, then faltered when
providers were not compensated.

• Exemptions have a poor track record of serving the
poor, often beneﬁting civil servants and their families.
• Assessment of individual targeting left to individual
providers, which generates a conﬂict of interest.

services or targeting poor people is the way to
go. The debate is often not in these terms. Most
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries use both
approaches. Many middle-income countries
are moving gradually, developing multiple programs to protect children, women, and the
poor, as in Colombia, Indonesia, Iran, and
Turkey. These programs may eventually
merge into a national system of universal coverage, as happened in industrial countries and
recently in Thailand. Geographical, age, and
individual targeting—despite leakages—often
reach the poor. But a combination of mechanisms seems necessary, and each country has
to assess whether mechanisms in place are
successful (table 8.3).
Decentralization has often been implemented with the hope that it would better
align spending with local needs, reducing the

information asymmetry between citizens and
politicians. But decentralization has had
mixed results in health.411 It has not always
meant increased resources for poor areas.
Transferring the provision function to local
governments has often overwhelmed them,
leaving them with little capacity and incentives to develop the policy function and
encourage citizen oversight. The transfer of
ownership of assets—hospitals and clinics—
to local government has also created incentives for rent-seeking by local elites. In
Uganda allocations to health services
declined when districts received responsibility for service delivery, personnel management, and allocation of health resources.
Spending on primary health care fell from 33
percent to 16 percent during 1995–98, and
the use of maternal and child health services
declined signiﬁcantly412 (chapter 10).

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Pro-poor coalitions
With widespread capture of health services
by the non-poor, building pro-poor coalitions to inﬂuence health spending is critical.
The democratic process conveys what poor
citizens value in health and health care. The
extent of health beneﬁts and the ﬁnancing of
health services are an electoral issue in
industrial countries—and, increasingly,
everywhere. In Thailand access to health services was a key plank in the political platform
of the Thai Rak Thai party, and its proposal
for universal health insurance, with a single
30-baht copayment, was eventually implemented.413 Eliminating hunger was a major
theme in the recent elections in Brazil.
Beyond the ballot box, poor citizens can
communicate their preferences through
national consultations, such as those for
poverty reduction strategy papers (chapter
11). A review of the consultation process for
25 poverty reduction strategy papers shows
that the poor care about health services, especially access, price, and social distance. In the
state of Oregon in the United States, tradeoffs
in beneﬁt coverage are discussed in consultations with the public. In the Netherlands the
Dunning Report, proposing criteria for
rationing health services, relied heavily on
citizen consultations. Citizen involvement in
budgeting is now an avenue for more voice in
health service delivery, as in Porto Alegre,
Brazil (chapter 5).414
Advocacy by civil society organizations
can put the interests of groups forgotten or
discriminated against on the agenda, as in the
campaign and court action to ban the use of
quinacrine for chemical sterilization in India.
Such organizations can build coalitions for
the interests of the disadvantaged. Pressure
through self-help groups and NGOs has triggered a productive dialogue on the public
response to AIDS in the Philippines and
South Africa.
Yet despite years of endorsement of participation, most health systems still resist
greater involvement by civil society in inﬂuencing health care allocations. Reforms in
the health sector often engender opposition
by powerful unions and professional associations, which have a much stronger power
base than poor citizens and can ﬁght to
maintain the status quo, as in New Zealand.

An altruistic vision can nonetheless motivate
coalitions between providers and citizens for
better services. Associations of rural doctors
in Thailand and midwives in Guatemala
have promoted alternative modes of health
service delivery that better reach the poor.

Information and monitoring to
increase accountability for outcomes
Creating policymaker accountability to citizens for delivering health services is a difﬁcult
task. A patient dying while waiting in line at a
public hospital makes front-page news. But
the thousands of children who die of treatable or vaccine-preventable diseases do not
get equal time. Politicians ﬁnd it easier to
claim success for building a hospital and providing employment to nurses and doctors
than for reducing malnutrition among a
nomadic group. Yet with a web of market and
government failures affecting those services,
policymakers are uniquely placed to create a
vision conducive to better outcomes. They
need to be accountable for equitably distributed health outcomes, protecting citizens
against impoverishing health expenditures
and helping the poor escape their social
exclusion, and not for the provision of growing quantities of services.
Better informed and educated citizens can
make politicians more accountable. Civil
society organizations can bridge the asymmetry of information between poor citizens
and policymakers. They can bring community participation into research, to ensure
that the perspectives of poor people inﬂuence
policy. Monitoring the performance of government policies, with report cards as in Bangalore and Ukraine (chapter 5), can work
well, particularly when income-disaggregated
data are available.
Civil society can also serve as a watchdog.
A Belgian health publication set in motion six
royal decrees of protective legislation by
drawing attention to health hazards. In
Bolivia a census-based, impact-oriented
approach combines pragmatism with quantitative and qualitative approaches.415 But generating information to support pro-poor
coalitions is a challenge. Epidemiological surveys may neglect the needs of peripheral
social groups, such as minority groups or
those affected by less common diseases.

Health and nutrition services

Compacts: provider incentives
to serve the poor
As long as men are liable to die and are desirous to
live, a physician will be well paid.
Jean de La Bruyère, 1645–1696

Even when policymakers truly care about
health services for poor people, it is not easy
to translate policy into reality. Making the
compact between policymakers and providers
work for the poor implies that governments:

•
•
•

Benchmark performance for services
they can monitor easily;
Foster autonomous providers for clinical
services;
Establish a strong monitoring function.

BOX 8.7

The government as active purchaser of health
outcomes through strategic contracting

Community nutrition projects in Madagascar and Senegal contracted out nutritional
services.Transaction costs for introducing
and maintaining the contracts were 13 percent of total project costs in Madagascar
and 17 percent in Senegal. Both projects
were well targeted to the poor communities.
Activities included growth monitoring,
health and nutrition education services for
mothers, food supplementation for malnourished children, and referrals to health
centers and home visits when necessary.
In Madagascar the project also had a
social fund for income-generating activities, and in Senegal an effort to improve
access to water.
The frontline providers in Madagascar
included women from the targeted neigh-

borhoods selected by the communities and
supervised by physicians hired by the projects. Open tendering was used to select the
supervising NGOs in Madagascar. Contractual agreements speciﬁed the services to be
provided and the number of beneﬁciaries
to be served, monitored monthly by the
user community and the project.
Childhood malnutrition declined signiﬁcantly in both projects. An evaluation in
Senegal after 17 months of project implementation showed almost zero prevalence
of severe malnutrition among children aged
6–11 months and a reduction in moderate
malnutrition from 28 percent to 24 percent
among children aged 6–35 months.
Source: Marek and others (1999).

Buying results
Widespread deﬁciencies in the technical
quality and ethics of frontline providers serving the poor—whether public or private—
reveal an incentive problem.416 The solution
lies in some form of compact between the
policymaker and provider to align the
provider’s incentives—already acknowledged
by La Bruyère in the 17th century—with the
policymaker’s wishes. How countries can create incentives to make autonomous or dispersed health service providers accountable
for outputs and outcomes depends on the
nature of services and the capacity to create
accountability for public objectives through
purchasing and regulation.417
Outcome-based contracts are difﬁcult to
implement because health outcomes are
often slow to change, difﬁcult and expensive
to measure, and affected by multiple factors
other than health services. Such contracts are
especially difﬁcult to write when outcomes
are linked to a variety of services, both professional and nonprofessional, as in efforts to
reduce under-ﬁve mortality or HIV prevalence. But the experience of Madagascar and
Senegal with nutrition programs for the poor
shows that it is possible, at least for malnutrition (box 8.7).
Less difﬁcult to implement are outputbased contracts that specify criteria for
disbursing public subsidies—on the basis of
increasing immunization rates, for example.
Output-based contracting is particularly successful for easily monitorable, single-product,

149

population-oriented services that can be
standardized. Explicit contracts have proven
effective in serving poor, hard-to-reach
groups.418 Output-based fees for services can
be paid to providers when quantity and quality can be deﬁned, thus contributing to
improvements in productivity. In Bangladesh
NGO ﬁeld health workers were paid on the
basis of their clients’ knowledge of oral rehydration therapy.
Implicit contracts with focus on speciﬁc
outputs can also work, as demonstrated by
the universal childhood immunization campaigns of the 1980s, and the Vitamin A supplementation and itinerant health teams in
Egypt, Indonesia, and Mexico.419 Malawi and
Uzbekistan have achieved immunization
coverage of more than 90 percent among the
poor with very low per capita spending. But
Bolivia, Guatemala, and Turkey, with higher
levels of spending, are much less successful
in providing equitable coverage (ﬁgure 8.10).
Performance-based contracts, whether
directly with health providers or with purchasers or insurers, need to align money with
intent, taking into account the variations in
effort required to produce a given output in
poor and disadvantaged regions and in
better-off communities.420 Costs of services
can be much higher in remote rural areas,
and broad variations have been found in the
cost of immunization between regions in the
same country.421

Performance benchmarks for more discretionary or multitask services, such as
clinical care, are more difﬁcult to establish.
Which services for whom, when, where,
how, and how much are difﬁcult to specify
in advance. Effort and quality are not readily veriﬁable. Providers have more gaming
space.422 Targeted payments to increase cervical smears in the United Kingdom led to a
short-term increase in the number of
smears. But in the long term providers reorganized their activities so that they would
continue to receive the payments without
delivering the services.423
Clinical service contracts also take considerable capacity to write and enforce.424
Purchasing based on output—per visit, per
case, per hospital day—causes the quantity
of clinical services provided to rise (sometimes mainly among better-off groups) and
the costs to escalate. Health reforms often
try to contain costs by establishing ﬁxedprice contracts—capitated payments, or
prospective global budgets—using caps to
keep costs down and shifting risks to the
provider. But this leaves to frontline

providers the responsibility for rationing
services, opening the possibility for creamskimming. Providers can lower their standard of care, deny service, or insist on additional informal fees (box 8.8).
Equitable service distribution then
requires providers to have both the technical capacity to inform the rationing process
and a pro-poor ethos to make this process
beneﬁt the poor—a combination often difﬁcult to achieve. High- and middle-income
countries are therefore increasingly delegating the undertaking of clinical service contracts to an autonomous—often parastatal—social insurance organization that
negotiates agreements for services to be
provided. They rely on more sophisticated
contracts and monitoring systems using
complex payment methods: for example,
case-based payments in Georgia or diagnostically related groups in Hungary.
Identifying poor target groups and
monitoring results are also more difﬁcult
for clinical care, because needs are more
difﬁcult to deﬁne. Cambodia’s contract,
which included speciﬁc provisions to
increase clinical services for the poor, had
mixed results (spotlight on Cambodia).
Incentives for treating those most in need
can be strengthened by calibrating payments to providers on the basis of impact
on health outcomes, with higher payments
for emergency obstetric care, as in Burkina
Faso, or with higher payments for treating
the poor, as in the Kyrgyz Republic (box
8.9). To exempt the poor from fees, how-

the doctor in the outpatient clinic where she

Modulated
payments for
providers according
to income criteria

The Kyrgyz Republic created an insurance fund
to purchase services from health facilities, compensating them for increased use of services and
providing greater ﬁnancial access to the poor.
Facilities charge fees to patients and claim payments from the insurance funds under a sliding
scale based on ﬁve categories of patients: selfreferred, uninsured, insured, partly exempt, and
fully exempt. Facilities get higher compensation
for clients from the partly exempt and exempt
categories, who pay lower fees. Sixty-eight percent of poor patients preferred the copayment
system over the previous theoretically free system, which often required “informal” payments.
Under the new payment mechanism, many
informal payments were replaced by formal
copayments.The very poor have access to treatment through a reserve fund.

sector. An autonomous parastatal hospital
in France that enjoys large ﬁnancial and
management ﬂexibility and an NGO hospital under government contract in Canada
are not very different.

be standardized, governments can generally

ever, providers need to receive timely and
adequate compensation.
Contractual arrangements often need to
combine soft capacity-building components
to meet unserved needs with rewards for
performance. Experience with performance-based contracts for immunization as
part of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunizations shows that zero-based contracts and the threat of resource withdrawal
were not very effective in raising coverage.426
Variations across communities can be taken
into account through a two-tier allocation
system. The ﬁrst tier can be allocated to a
local government on a capitation basis—as
in Argentina, Brazil, Ethiopia, and Poland—
and the second tier to an insurance fund or a
purchasing agency in charge of maximizing
the efﬁciency of resources and purchasing
an appropriate mix and quantity of clinical
services—as in Korea and New Zealand (ﬁgure 8.11).
The impact on the poor of the changes in
provider payments from input-based to
more complex output-based is not conclusive, and there has been little evaluation. But
the separation of policymaking from purchasing and service provision creates clearer
channels of accountability. Autonomous
providers have more ﬂexibility in ensuring
the appropriate input mix including hiring
and ﬁring, as in Kenya and Zambia.427 Purchasing bodies are more independent actors,
subject to a double line of accountability
because they are often ﬁnanced by governments and households through insurance
systems. Governments need to be involved
in these agencies to deﬁne which services the
poor need most, price the subsidy support
needed by the poor, and limit providers’
conﬂicts of interest.

There is no presumption that one type of

Public health facilities can be remarkably

immunization levels have stalled at under
30 percent. Nor are NGOs necessarily propoor. When contracted by governments,

characteristics and monitor and enforce the
contract. Government providers deliver
high immunization rates in Tajikistan or
Tunisia—but in Cambodia and Haiti so do
contracted NGOs. As contractors NGOs
can extend service outreach and test new
approaches to service delivery.428
To support self-care, private services—
whether for-proﬁt or not-for-proﬁt—often
are most appropriate. Private for-proﬁt
providers can be very efﬁcient in providing
information and distributing commodities—witness the success of social marketing. For information and social support,
grassroots organizations, small private
providers, and community-based organizations often do the job better than rigid public organizations. Governments can contract some key services such as information.
Yet public services can sometimes be more
pro-poor than NGO services. In Ceará,
Brazil, “many NGOs delivered services in
clinics while the public service sent its
workers into households”429 (see spotlight).
For clinical services the contrast is sharper.
Public provision works well when there is a
strong public ethos, the politics are pro-poor,
and rules are enforced. For-proﬁt providers—qualiﬁed or not—are usually in tune
with demand, but the inherent conﬂicts of
interest require external control. In Lebanon
and elsewhere, expansion of the private sector did not beneﬁt the poor much.430 In
India, private providers serving poor groups
are often less than qualiﬁed. Governments
can then exert control only if they have
sophisticated regulation and purchasing
functions. When these do not exist, partnerships between government and civil society
organizations can compensate by strengthening clients’ power over clinical providers.
Because not-for-proﬁt organizations
often beneﬁt from strong intrinsic motivation and professional ethos, government
can also write open-ended contracts with
them and still expect that providers will do
the right thing. Service delivery by NGOs
can help repair the link between policymakers and providers for clinical services with
signiﬁcant beneﬁts for the poor. In
Guatemala, about a third of the population
is now served by NGO providers, signiﬁcantly increasing access for indigenous poor

populations although management and
quality problems have been observed.431

Regulation and enforcement
Governments can also use market regulation
to counter conﬂicts of interest. In Hungary
accreditation mechanisms have been quite
successful in establishing quality criteria for
providers. To reduce supplier-induced oversupply and compensate for the lack of investment in poorer settings, most countries use
certiﬁcates of needs (in United States), planning boards (Australia), or health maps
(Spain and most of Africa). But most lowincome countries do not regulate their pharmaceutical market successfully, though
Cambodia has had some success. When regulation fails, a combination of user education and provider training can yield the
greatest beneﬁts.432 Government involvement through national tendering, price capping, or tariff reduction has also inﬂuenced
the prices of pharmaceuticals.433 Overall the
enforcement of regulatory controls is often
weak, focusing mainly on personnel licensing. The same political and institutional failures hampering health service delivery affect
the legislative, administrative, and judicial
services needed to make regulation work.
Expanding access to professional health
care providers—particularly midwifery, surgical skills for reducing maternal mortality,
and clinical skills for reducing neonatal
deaths—is a priority to reach the Millennium
Development Goals. In many countries the
imbalance between rural and urban areas in
terms of skilled health workers is extreme. In
Turkey, there is one doctor per 266 people in
the richest region and one per 2,609 in the
poorest. In Ghana and Senegal more than
half the physicians are concentrated in the
capital city, where fewer than 20 percent of
people live. Health workers lack opportunities in rural areas where turnover is high.
Rural workers are less likely to be female and
educated. Lack of services (school, water) and
access to training/education are major incentives to leave rural areas. Undifferentiated
salary structures are disincentives to work in
areas where the poor live, because it is difﬁcult to supplement low salaries with alternative income from activities such as private
practice, teaching, and consulting.434

The human resource crisis in health services

When the international community set out in
1955 to eradicate malaria, Africa was left out
because it lacked adequately trained personnel. Today, Africa still lacks such personnel, and
yet it must deal with multiple disease-control
efforts. In Burkina Faso, the average number of
physicians per 100,000 people was 3.4 in the
1990s compared with 303 for nine industrial
countries. In Zambia the already low number of
physicians, at 8.3 per 100,000 people in the
1960s, declined to 6.9 in the 1990s. To meet the
requirements of the priority health interventions recommended by the World Health Organization, Chad would require a sevenfold
increase in health personnel.

High rates of absenteeism reﬂect disenchantment with working conditions. Studies of health
professionals in Ghana, India, Mozambique,Tanzania, and Uganda show that the health work
force—nurses and physicians in particular—feel
overworked and underappreciated. In Guinea,
Mauritania, Poland, and Russia health staff wages
have declined in real terms.
There has been considerable emigration of
health professionals from developing countries.
More than 600 South African doctors are registered in New Zealand, at a cost to South African
taxpayers of roughly $37 million. An estimated
61 percent of Ghanaian doctors trained between
1985 and 1994 left the country. Nurses are leav-

ing too: in 2001 the United Kingdom approved
22,462 work permits for nurses from developing
countries.
To retain internationally marketable health
staff, poor countries will have to offer
internationally competitive wages and beneﬁts.
That requires replacing inﬂexible civil service
policies with more ﬂexible approaches.Training
speciﬁcally oriented to national markets can also
help. Countries that emulate the training standards of industrial countries tend to be more vulnerable to poaching (Ghana).There is evidence
from Ethiopia and the Gambia that community
nurses and health ofﬁcers with curricula not
internationally certiﬁed are less likely to migrate.

Chile, Mexico, and Thailand435 have used
ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial incentives to
encourage qualiﬁed staff to work in rural
areas. In Indonesia doctors were also allowed
to supply private services during or after duty
hours. Other countries have tried to establish
new credentials, as for health ofﬁcers in
Ethiopia, and trained community workers in
India and Brazil (spotlight on Ceará).
Another approach includes progressively
upgrading the skills of traditional providers,
such as community midwives in Malaysia, or
encouraging the hiring and training of health

workers from underserved areas or social
groups as done in Indonesia and Iran. In the
Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee
(BRAC) community workers are trained to
seek out the extremely poor in need of urgent
medical care. But success requires careful
design and evaluation. In El Salvador lowskilled health promoters posted in rural villages did little to improve health or healthseeking behavior.436 The global crisis in the
labor market for clinical services also requires
innovative strategies to get professional services to rural areas and the poor (box 8.10).

The complexity and dispersed nature of
clinical health services and the potential for
conﬂicts of interest make self-monitoring by
providers critical for effective service delivery. Historically, peer regulation has been the
common response to a conﬂict of interest.
But because of state dominance in many
countries, professional bodies are fairly
weak. Provider-driven changes in the organization of service provision can yield substantial beneﬁts for clients, as in initiatives such
as Health Workers for Change.437 The German health system is largely self-regulated.
Professional associations in Zimbabwe
maintain professional ethics and standards
among public and private nurses.438 Associations of midwives in Guatemala and New
Zealand develop and promote a pro-poor
ethos (box 8.11).

Information and monitoring
Decentralization, devolution, and outputbased contracting of services increase the
importance of timely and accurate information for monitoring performance. National
and international statistics do not yet capture
the range of practices or the performance of
all health care providers. Most ministries of
health know little about the private sector,
which makes it hard to develop partnerships
or contracts, although countries are attempting to conduct provider surveys as in
Poland.439 Information on access, quality, and
efﬁciency is scarce and often noncomparable.
And because many factors outside the health
sector affect health status, cross-sectoral
monitoring and planning are also required, as
Thailand’s National Economic and Social
Development Board does regularly.
Monitoring of average outcomes or service utilization patterns often does not reveal
where change is occurring. Changes in fertil-

BOX 8.11

ity rates and contraceptive use in most SubSaharan countries in the 1990s have been
concentrated in the urban, richest population segments. In Tanzania the declining use
of skilled delivery care between 1993 and
1999 can be attributed mainly to declining
use among the poorest groups. When collecting information on income is difﬁcult,
alternative indicators can be used, such as
ethnicity, caste, region, gender, linguistic
group, or religion. Countries as different as
Colombia, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, and the
Philippines use community maps to identify
high-risk individuals and households in
need of home visits and special attention.440

Six sizes ﬁt all?
Which accountability mechanisms should
be emphasized to ensure that health
resources go where they should? There is no
single path. The many things that inﬂuence
the short and long routes of accountability
call for different responses. For health and
nutrition services, one size does not ﬁt all.
What works varies by country and type of
service. A strong command-and-control
approach can achieve much if policymakers
have a solid mandate or the ideological
drive to make tough choices about which
health services to deliver and to whom—as
in Cuba,441 Malaysia, or Iran. Greater inclusion of poor people in the political debate
can inﬂuence policymakers, as in Brazil
where the pro-poor orientation of health
policies has improved over the past 10 years
(spotlight on Ceará). But when the mandate
is less clear and implementation levers are
weak, the short route of accountability
through client partnerships with private
and community-based providers gives poor
people more control over services.

Developing a professional ethos in midwifery

In the words of a professor of midwifery,
“Midwives should be able to take on a more
enabled,‘for women’ role.This then has implications for regulation, which should be ‘self regulated’ to a point—but should also have input to
that process from women themselves, and from
fellow professionals. . . . Midwives should be very
involved in the process, . . . but if they are the only

ones involved, the danger is that a ‘for midwife’
culture develops, protecting midwives and perpetuating problems. . . . The formal process can
also be backed up by a less formal process (i.e.
peer review) to ensure lots of midwife to midwife
contact and learning.This ‘with-women/forwomen’ stance can then form a foundation for
what ‘professionalism’ looks like for midwifery. . . .

We need to be able to form a contract, . . . and follow up on it, all the time respecting woman’ s
individuality and the culture in which she lives.
This all implies enough education to do this well,
and enough power to inﬂuence the system.This
is what I would describe as ‘professional’.”

Figure 8.12 attempts to capture some typical
situations that could provide guidance. Situations vary according to the homogeneity of
the health needs, the nature of services, and
the characteristics of the political process.

Provision
1 Government contracting as services are
standardized and quality and quantity can be
monitored. Output-based contracting is
possible. Decentralization can pose problems
as economies of scale can be important
because of network externality and public
goods.

Financing

2 Voice: pro-poor coalitions putting pressure
on governments with limited capacity to
focus action on services they can monitor,
reaching the whole population. Focused
public provision or contracting out to
intrinsically motivated providers (NGOs,
CBOs) to compensate for potential problems
due to deficient government.

Public financing as those services are
unlikely to be driven by the market.
Alternatively collective action can build
into large civil society organizations (e.g.,
BRAC Bangladesh).

3 Government contracting with enlisting of
users’ groups and individuals in monitoring
providers (fees/food stamps/vouchers).
Outcome (nutrition) and output (knowledge,
goods)–based contracting of local NGOs or
community-based organizations if capacity to
monitor results exists.

Public subsidies: “supply side” to
commodities and information, e.g., social
marketing; “demand-side” (vouchers) to
individuals and communities.

4 Client power: imitate the market and foster
role of civil society organizations in
disseminating information and commodities:
commercial networks, cooperative,
peer/support groups, community based
organizations, local NGOS.

Copayments: competition likely to drive
prices down as asymmetry of information
is low. Use of local/community solidarity
networks.

5 Government provision or contracting of
intrinsically motivated providers. Public
provision implies standardization of
the benefits package and a well-accepted
rationing approach combined with a strong
public ethos. Contracting possible with
intrinsically motivated providers (e.g.,
NGOs). Contracting for-profit providers
only if sophisticated purchasing
function and capacity to measure outputs
exists.

Social or government insurance made
progressive through differential
contributions. Public subsidies to
insurance premiums, exemptions for
copayments for the poor, and/or third-party
payments (e.g., poverty funds). Equalization
of resource allocation for poor regions:
matching grants, poverty-sensitive
capitation.

6 Client’s power, voice and providers’ ethos.
Coproduction: community-owned/managed/
monitored services, e.g., drug revolving
funds, community-based services. Litigation:
consumer courts/ombudsman. Voice: report
cards, pro-poor coalitions. Self-regulation:
intrinsically motivated providers/NGOs;
foster professional ethos through
professional organizations.

Copayments, cross-subsidies, and
microinsurance. Copayments to avoid
elite capture and ensure presence and
responsiveness of providers. Local
retention of locally generated funds.
Cross-subsidies between services. Local
solidarity networks, micro-insurance.
Strengthen collective action outside of
government arena: autonomous purchasing
agency/social insurance under citizens’
oversight.

Public financing: as collective action
needed, funds to come from the public
purse, most often taxes. Financing can be
integrated into social insurance—if the
latter is well functioning and pro-poor—
with public subsidy. Demand-side
subsidies to stimulate demand.

When the long route of accountability
works well for poor people—their concerns
are included in the political process—public
action beneﬁts them. Governments can
provide or contract out standardized population-oriented services (1), and provide

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

demand-side subsidies to poor families for
those and for appropriate self-care (3).
Needs for clinical care can be made homogeneous through a technocratic rationing of
services based on equal beneﬁts. In this case
an integrated service delivery approach—or
a universal single payer system—can be
appropriate, as in Cuba, Finland, and Vietnam (5).
But these conditions are far from universal. Needs for self-care or clinical services
are rarely homogeneous. This heterogeneity
can be accommodated in a pro-poor context through decentralization and ﬂexible
output-based and outcome-based contracting combined with equalization of subsidies between rich and poor regions (3 and
5). Subsidies for clinical services can be provided to local medical schemes (as in Germany and Poland), to speciﬁc schemes for
poor people (as in France, Indonesia, and
Thailand), or directly to poor groups
(poverty funds in China) (5).
The long route of accountability may also
not be working—either because richer groups
capture the political process or because the
bureaucratic process—compact—does not
deliver. In these cases more investment in the
long route through taxation and strengthened
government actions is unlikely to do much for
the poor. Instead, more needs to be invested in

making poor citizens’ voice heard by fostering
civil society groups, and building pro-poor
coalitions for services requiring collective
action. Governments with limited capacity
can then be pressured to focus on contracting
population-oriented services, in partnership
with intrinsically motivated providers—community or civil society organizations—to
make sure the services are delivered (2).
Serving heterogeneous needs where the
long route of accountability is not working
is common in developing countries and
requires enlisting poor people as monitors,
investing in client’s power. Commercial and
media networks, cooperatives, and community-driven development activities are then
best used to support self-care (4). Microinsurance schemes, and community comanaged health services and drug funds are
especially relevant for clinical care (6). But
this power is not enough to avoid conﬂicts
of interest. Litigation can be of limited help.
More importantly, altruistically motivated
providers, such as not-for-proﬁts, can help
foster a stronger pro-poor ethos supported
by professional self regulation (6).
None of the solutions is fast or easy. But
success is clearly possible, as hundreds of
examples have shown. “It does not matter
how slowly you go so long as you do not
stop” (Confucius, 551–479 BC).

spotlight on

Costa Rica and Cuba

Good health at (initially) low income
Costa Rica and Cuba have both attained very low levels of infant mortality in the last 50 years. For Costa Rica, this is easily explained by rapid income growth and attention to traditional public health and, in recent years, to innovative
approaches to publicly funded health care. Cuba, on the other hand, has maintained lower levels of infant mortality than
many industrial countries and has eliminated diseases common to developing countries while remaining very poor. The
achievements came with a community-based health system with numerous health workers, highly motivated staff, and
close monitoring and evaluation of outcomes. Can Cuba’s model survive the economic reversals of the 1990s and pressure
for a more open and free society?

C

osta Rica and Cuba both have very
similar, low infant mortality
rates—almost as low as Canada’s
though at much lower incomes (ﬁgure
1).442 Their routes to this happy circumstance, however, have been quite different
In 1945, infant mortality—measured in
deaths of infants under one year per 1,000
live births—was 100 in Costa Rica and 40 in
Cuba, respectively. Up to 1960 Costa Rica
made progress largely due to economic
growth and aggressive public health programs.443 Hookworm was eliminated with a
program starting in 1942, and public health
campaigns accelerated after the revolution of
1948. As a result, malaria, tuberculosis, and
most diseases that were preventable by vaccines at that time were also eliminated by
1960. In stark contrast, Cuba’s admittedly
low level of infant mortality stagnated under
a particularly corrupt political regime.
Since 1960, progress in Costa Rica has
been rapid but not too difﬁcult to explain.
Costa Rica’s real income per capita
increased by 25 percent from 1960 to
1970—the same rate, coincidentally, that
infant mortality declined. Income growth
of 40 percent by 1980 along with the universalization of coverage for health care saw
a further decrease of 60 percent in infant

mortality. After recessions in the 1980s,
growth has resumed and progress on health
status continues. One way to attain good
health from initially low income is surely to
stop having a low income.

The Cuban puzzle—
good health without growth
The puzzle is Cuba. How has Cuba managed to maintain an infant mortality rate at
least as low as that of any developing country in the Western Hemisphere and quite a
few industrial counties as well? The sustained focus of the political leadership on
health for more than 40 years surely played
a big part. After the revolution, universal
and equitable health care was one of the
government’s top three goals. The government sees good health as a key performance
indicator for itself.
Despite low infant mortality before the
revolution, rural areas lagged far behind
urban areas. The new government, committed to changing this, concentrated on
providing health care to rural areas. It
required all new medical school graduates
to serve for one year in rural areas. It also
increased the number of rural health facilities. In 1961 the government nationalized
mutual-aid cooperatives and private hospitals, which left the public sector as the sole
provider of health services—a feature of the
system that remains today. At that time
many of the country’s medical professionals left the country (as many as two-thirds
by one estimate).
In the mid- to late 1960s there were two
major innovations in the health system.
First was the establishment of policlinics—
the basic unit of health services—each
staffed by several specialists and nurses and
serving a population of 25,000–30,000.
This was combined with campaigns to
immunize many more people, control vectors (such as mosquitoes), and promote
good health practices.

Second was the creation of a community health program, with specialists tending patients in clinics as well as at home,
school, or work.
In the mid-1980s this community-based
approach was intensiﬁed with the Family
Doctor Program. The goal: to place a doctor
trained in primary health care and a nurse
in every neighborhood (serving about 150
families). By 2001 there were more than
30,000 doctors—a ratio of one family doctor for every 365 Cubans.444 Services are
free, although nonhospitalized patients are
required to co-pay for medicines.
While this approach clearly contributes
to better health outcomes, it is also expensive. Indeed, Cuba spends substantially more
of its gross domestic product on health than
other Latin American countries: 6.6 percent
in 2002. (Average public spending on health
is 3.3 percent in Latin America and the
Caribbean, but some other countries also
spend substantial amounts—Costa Rica 4.4
percent and Panama 5.2 percent).445

Specifying what you want—and
keeping track of what’s going on
The Cuban health model rests on three pillars: giving clear instructions to providers,
motivating staff, and monitoring and evaluating the system.446 Clear guidelines are
provided through national specialist advisory groups—which draw up standards and
technical procedures (and evaluate the performance of physicians and specialists)—
and regulations that standardize activities
in the national hospital care system.
Health staff in Cuba typically are highly
motivated. Medical training emphasizes the
altruism of medical service—often culminating in service of one or two years
abroad. This is volunteer service, but there
are strong social pressures for it. Serving in
poor rural areas in Cuba remains a right of
passage for many newly trained doctors.

engaged in international solidarity missions
raise their proﬁle and contribute to a sense
of pride in Cuba’s doctors.
Cuba also keeps close track of what’s
going on in health facilities. Monitoring is
strong, with information ﬂowing in many
directions. The main elements are:

•

An integrated national health statistics
system that collects data routinely from
service providers. Indicators of particular concern, such as infant mortality, are
collected with high frequency—some
even daily.

•

Regular inspection of, and supervision
visits to, health facilities.

•

Annual evaluations of health technicians on the technical and scientiﬁc
results of their work. In addition, a randomly selected sample undergoes external evaluation.

•

Annual reports by the Ministry of Public Health and the provincial and
municipal health directorates to the
People’s Power Assembly.

Monitoring and evaluation go beyond
statistical and expert assessments. Public
dissemination of health indicators, at the
end of each year, draws citizens into the
process. In addition, citizens can complain

about providers. Their complaints can go
through the health system—such as the
policlinic that coordinates the local health
facilities, the municipal health council, or
hospital administrators. Or they can go
through political channels—say, to the local
representative of the People’s Power Assembly, which is required to respond. Despite
this monitoring, there is limited direct citizen control: participation in administrative
and health councils does not entail much
more than setting broad targets.447 Likewise, citizens play only a small role in setting priorities within the health sector, and
between health and other sectors.

Can Cuba sustain the system?
The 1990s were difﬁcult for Cuba. The collapse of the socialist system in Europe and
in the Soviet Union and the tightening of
the economic embargo by the United States
led to a severe economic contraction. Cuba
lost the trading partners that had provided
most of its imports of medicines, food, fuel,
and equipment used in agriculture and
mining. Between 1988 and 1993 imports of
medicines fell by more than 60 percent. By
1994 agricultural production had fallen by
almost half. Drug shortages persist today.448
Government spending on social services, particularly health care, was pro-

tected, with public spending on health
exceeding 10 percent of GDP in 2000. But
in real terms, spending had gone down.
Health outcome indicators worsened in the
early and mid-1990s, recovering only somewhat by the end of the decade.
As health infrastructure suffered, so did
transport services. Public transport had all
but disappeared by the early 1990s, and fuel
shortages limited the use of private cars.
Cubans resorted to walking miles to work,
and the use of bicycles skyrocketed.449
The economic reversal also appears to
be weakening motivation among staff.
Physicians are paid relatively well, earning
almost 15 percent more than the average
national wage.450 But their pay is in local
currency, with purchasing power declining
steadily over the past decade. The legalization of a separate “dollar economy” has
made occupations that pay in dollars
highly prized. Stories of doctors shirking
their formal duties to join this parallel
economy—driving taxicabs, for example—
are common.451
Time will tell whether an approach that
relies on a publicly paid doctor for every
150 families can be sustained in times of
economic hardship—and with competition
from an economy that relies more on the
dollar.

Drinking water, sanitation,
and electricity

9

chapter

Drinking water, sanitation, sewage disposal,
electricity, rural roads, and urban transport
inﬂuence human development outcomes
(crate 1.1). As with education and health
services, the impact of infrastructure services on human development is direct (e.g.,
reducing water-related diseases, which rank
among the top killers of children). The
impact is also indirect, through economic
growth.452 But like education and health,
these services are failing poor people.
Focusing on water, sanitation, and electricity services, this chapter uses the Report’s
service delivery framework to ﬁnd out why
and to show how things might be improved.
The reform lessons from these services, representing both network and non-network
services, are also likely to apply to other
infrastructure services.
For networked services, such as urban
water and electricity, regulating providers
and ensuring that poor people have access to
affordable services are the main reasons for
government intervention. This brings the
long route of accountability into play. But
poor citizens have a weak voice because water
and electricity are particularly vulnerable to
patronage politics. Providers end up being
more accountable to policymakers than to
clients, which breaks the long route of
accountability.
The solution is to separate the policymakers from the providers—and to make
providers more responsive to clients. Dispersing ownership through decentralization and private participation, promoting
competition through benchmarking, ensuring alternative access by using independent
providers, and charging for services are
ways of separating policymakers from
providers and strengthening compacts,
client power, and voice.

In rural network and non-network settings, community and self-provision dominate. The policymaker as standard setter
and capacity builder in support of the client
is missing. To avoid ensuing problems, such
as arsenic in Bangladesh’s rural drinking
water, policymakers need to support clients
in ensuring service quality and access.
Externalities in sanitation in rural, nonnetwork settings are best contained within the
village or community. So supply-side support
at the household level should be complemented with interventions at the community
level—be it information about hygiene or
subsidization of latrines—that are designed to
spur household demand and create community peer pressure for behavior that internalizes the externalities. In urban settings, where
demand for sanitation services may be greater,
property rights and facilitating private
response can support collective efforts.

The state of water
and sanitation services
About 2 of every 10 people in the developing
world were without access to safe water in
2000; 5 of 10 lived without adequate sanitation; and 9 of 10 lived without their wastewater treated in any way.453 There have been
gains, but despite the many global commitments, notably the U.N. Decade for Water
and Sanitation, access to water and sanitation
lags far behind the milestones set in the
1980s. Nor do aggregate trends in the 1990s
give comfort (ﬁgure 9.1). The share of people
with access to these services in Africa and
Asia—where the world’s poor are concentrated—has fallen, remained constant, or
increased only slowly.

that water and sanitation services are too
often failing communities.454 Full-pressure,
“24-7” water supply remains a pipe dream
in many cities. Because a quarter to half
(and more) of urban water supply remains
unaccounted for, many cities are turned
into leaking buckets (ﬁgure 9.2). The limited number of network access points must
be widely shared, which dramatically
increases waiting times and often simply
overwhelms the system. Rural infrastructure often goes to seed: more than a third of
existing rural infrastructure in South Asia is
estimated to be dysfunctional.455
Poor people bear a disproportionate
share of the impact of inefﬁcient water and
sanitation services. Fewer poor people are
connected to a network. When they do have
access, the installation has to be shared
among many more people (ﬁgure 9.3). And
the prices they pay are among the highest,
generally more than those paid by more
afﬂuent households connected to the piped
system (ﬁgure 9.4). The price differential is
partly a result of inefﬁciencies—the
inequitable practice of subsidizing piped
water, lack of scale economies for independent providers, or worse, providers taking
advantage of poor people’s lack of choice.
But some of the price differential can also
reﬂect the ﬂexibility and convenience of
services offered by independent providers—no connection charges or access to
quantities of water that are more affordable
for poor people.

Countries are trying different approaches to
address failing water, sanitation, and electricity services. These include decentralizing to
local governments, private sector participation, regulatory reform, community-driven
development, and small independent
providers. Some approaches try to make services work for poor people through targeted
interventions. Others seek to improve services overall—on the premise that making
services work for all is necessary for making
them work for poor people. The same
approach has worked in one setting and
failed in another, and different approaches
have worked in seemingly the same setting.
What is needed is a way to think about the
institutional and political characteristics of
infrastructure services to understand what
works where and why.

hold each other accountable within four relationships (ﬁgure 9.5):

•
•
•
•

Client power connects service users with
providers.
Voice connects citizens with politicians
and policymakers through the political
process.
Compacts connect policymakers through
implicit or explicit contracts with providers
responsible for services.
And management connects provider
organizations with frontline across-thecounter providers.

Short route of accountability. In a simple
market transaction, the buyer holds the
seller accountable for the product bought,
rewards the seller by repeating business, or
penalizes the seller by choosing another
provider. This accountability is “short”
because the client can hold the provider
directly accountable, without any intermediaries. Small, independent providers in
water and sanitation and their clients are
usually in such a market relationship.
In Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, a cholera
outbreak in 1996 forced the sewerage and
sanitation department to loosen its
monopoly on cesspit cleaning and allow
private providers in. There is now an
emerging competitive private market for
cesspit cleaning—households can choose a
provider based on price and (easy-to-monitor) performance. Besides allowing entry
and implementing regulations on sewage
disposal, the city’s role has been small.456
But service and market conditions that
automatically give clients power—through
choice, ease of monitoring, and market
enforceability—are not always present for
infrastructure services. So the route of
accountability has to be long.
Long route of accountability. Governments worldwide deem it their responsibility to provide, ﬁnance, regulate, and in
other ways inﬂuence infrastructure services.
They do it for two good reasons: market
failures and equity concerns. First, networked infrastructure services exhibit

economies of scale, or network externalities, that make it technically more efﬁcient
to have a single distributor of the service. In
sanitation the externalities come literally
from spillovers. Yes, households in Dar-esSalaam were willing to pay for improved
sanitation with larger health beneﬁts to the
city. But free-rider problems, where one
person’s behavior hurts others with
impunity—as in the case of runoff from
open defecation in many parts of Asia and
Africa—require community or government
intervention. Second, societies care about
equity, and governments often redistribute
resources—such as a lifeline water subsidy—to ensure the minimum equitable
service access that markets cannot.
Network externalities, collective action
problems, and distributional goals thus
provide powerful reasons for the government to be involved. The arrangements
then are no longer primarily between the
client and the provider, and new accountability relationships become important.
The ﬁrst of these arrangements is voice—
citizens delegating to politicians the responsibility to ensure the infrastructure services they want. The second is through the
compacts between policymakers and
providers—to design the service delivery
framework, choose a provider, and ensure
that it meets citizen expectations. Voice and
compacts together become the “long route”
of accountability. In Bangladesh the prime
minister and her power minister are, in
principle, accountable to citizens for the
performance of the Power Development

Board, a corporation owned and operated
by government.
The short and long routes of accountability need to work together. Indeed, even for
cesspit services in Dar-es-Salaam, government regulation was necessary to ensure that
the small private operators complemented
the public provider and complied with
sewage disposal guidelines. Effective solutions are likely to be a strategic mixture of the
short and long routes of accountability as a
system in which the clients, the policymaker,
and the provider are linked in accountability
relationships that make services work for
poor people.

Why infrastructure services fail poor
people: patronage
Because the family has been without daytime
water for the past decade, the children have never

eve of the privatization of Manila’s public

and Sewerage System (MWSS), in 1997

Where water, sanitation, and electricity are
publicly managed, the accountability to citizens is achieved when the state ensures that
utilities, boards, and government departments provide efﬁcient and equitable services for all citizens, including the poor.
When the state is unsuccessful and the voice
relationship is not effective, the long route
of accountability has failed.
In 1997 the MWSS was typical of service
utilities, boards, and government departments that consider politicians and policymakers as their real clients. Politicians—
responding to equity concerns or, more
likely, to short-term political gain—often
keep prices for infrastructure services well
below those for cost recovery. This makes
service providers dependent on politically
motivated budget transfers for survival—or
when transfers are not forthcoming, on service cutbacks that attract no penalties from
policymakers.
State-owned water and electricity providers then cease to function as autonomous service providers.457 They become

With patronage, the compact between the politician
and provider—the utility or board—is neither transparent nor determined by universal client needs.
Politicians exert their control by appointing (and dismissing) company directors and by providing public
subsidies to ﬁnance investments and prop up ailing
enterprises. In return for this patronage, water companies are often obliged to supply political favors in
the form of excess employment, the depressing of
tariffs, political targeting of new investments, and
the distribution of contracts on the basis of political
criteria.The consequences: spiraling costs, low ser-

extensions of policymakers. The policymaker and provider begin to fuse into one
role. When this happens, policymakers can
no longer hold providers accountable for
delivering to all citizens, services deteriorate, and poor citizens as clients are left
powerless.
The dynamics of this relationship can be
even more debilitating for poor clients.
Over time providers become a strong political force, inﬂuencing the policymaker. In
effect, providers capture the policymaking
process, exerting pressures through organized labor or their ability to control service
delivery for the politician. With deteriorating service levels, policymakers and
providers ration access. This has an important implication when lumpy investments
are needed to gain access to services—
whether through an electricity grid, a village water network, or even a stand-alone

vice quality, and precarious ﬁnances.The scarcity of
resources for investment leaves much of the populace without adequate services and forces them to
rely on expensive or inconvenient alternatives.
The clientelist model broadly describes the politics of urban and rural regional utilities in both water
and electricity sectors. It also applies to local administrations in charge of urban or village-based
services (funding of piped networks or community
toilets or even public investment in deep tubewells).
Source: Foster (2002).

system, such as tubewells. Citizens or their
groups respond to rationed access by supporting politicians who favor them as their
clients over politicians who push for universal access. This strengthens the ability of
politicians to use patronage. The accountability linking clients, politicians, policymakers, and providers is displaced by
patron-client relationships—clientelism—
on both legs of the long route of accountability (box 9.1).458
In such settings, the breakdown in voice
for poor citizens is reinforced by their loss
of client power. Dahli Aspillera’s question—
did you care?—reﬂects both a sense that the
client cannot penalize the provider for poor
service and a deeper reality that the long
route of accountability has failed the citizen.
If failure of voice is at the root of weak service delivery in water, sanitation, and electricity, what are the options for reform?

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Urban water networks
Who is the Water Board accountable to?
Question asked of the Managing Director
of the Hyderabad Water Board by a consumer,
Hyderabad, September 2002

In cities and towns, where scale economies
prevail, water systems have major network
suppliers—generally a public sector provider,
such as the Lagos water board in Nigeria, or a
small municipal water department, as in Chapai Nawabganj in Bangladesh. Some of these
providers belong to local governments—as in
the case of the Johannesburg water utility;
some to a state government—as is common
in India; and some—like MWSS in Manila—
to central governments. For all, the relevant
questions are whether there is a clear delineation of roles between the policymaker and
the provider—and whom the provider is
accountable to, the policymaker or the client?
When voice and politics fail, the distinction
between the two is blurred, and the provider is
accountable to the policymaker.
Four reform strategies can potentially separate policymakers and providers: decentralizing assets, using private participation in
operations, charging for services, and relying
on independent providers to give clients
choice. The ﬁrst two aim to inﬂuence compacts, the second two to strengthen client
power. All are politically difﬁcult to implement. That is not surprising, since strong
political forces—not technocratic failures—
blur the roles of policymakers and providers.
The issue is whether these strategies can proBOX 9.2

vide incentives to remove patronage and compensate for the weak voice of poor people.

Strengthening the compact:
decentralizing assets
Devolving responsibilities to different tiers of
policymakers and separating powers between
them can create the right incentives to
improve service delivery. First, by having service and political boundaries better coincide,
decentralization can strengthen voice and
accountability. Second, when the center is in
charge of both regulatory and service delivery
responsibilities, it has few incentives to hold
itself accountable. Devolving services to
another tier of policymaker triggers incentives
more compatible with having the center (or an
upper-tier government) oversee the regulatory
framework. Finally, devolution creates an
opportunity to benchmark performance and
use ﬁscal resources and reputation as rewards
to support efﬁcient service provision. The contestability for resources in this context requires
a tier with ﬁscal capacity and without service
provision responsibilities—appropriate for
the center (or a state in a federal system).
Devolving responsibilities to local governments has had mixed results in water
and sanitation, often leading to the loss of
scale economies, eroding commercial viability by excessive fragmentation, and even
constitutional conﬂicts between municipalities and upper-tier governments.459 The
historical experience of industrial countries
offers lessons for addressing these problems
(box 9.2).

Decentralization and the water industry—in history

In France water assets have historically been
devolved to the commune—the lowest tier of
government. Clusters of communes have integrated the industry by delegating water and
sanitation services “upward” to private or semipublic companies.The functional boundaries of
the companies cut across several communes,
which continue to own the assets but contract
out the management of services.
In the United States water and sanitation
assets are also devolved to local governments.
Where local governments have been carved up
into small political jurisdictions and individual
water works are impractical, privately owned
companies have emerged to provide regional
services covering several local governments.

Examples include Elizabeth and Hackensack,
both in New Jersey.
Interestingly, for France and some areas in the
United States, the limited capacity of the smaller
local governments provided the incentives for private companies to serve clusters of political jurisdictions. In both France and the United States the
multijurisdictional coverage prevents the water
provider from being captured by any one local
body—thus maintaining the separation from
local policymakers.
The approach was different in England and
the Netherlands. At the outset of the 20th century in both countries, oversight and direct provision of water services were in the hands of
local authorities. In the Netherlands these were

under company structures, mostly owned and
run by municipalities, but many were under private operation if not ownership. In England the
national government consolidated the local
water systems into regional bodies, moving
from 1,400 in World War II to 187 in 1974 and 10
in the 1980s, all eventually privatized. In the
Netherlands, also under central government
mandate, the municipal companies were converted to regional companies to support the
expansion of services to rural areas. But the
companies remained under the ownership of
municipalities and provinces.

Drinking water, sanitation, and electricity

Fragmentation and the loss of scale
economies can be partly addressed by permitting interjurisdictional agreements. In the
French syndicat model, municipal jurisdictions can cede the right to provide water and
sanitation services to a company jointly owned
by several local authorities. Bolivia’s water law
explicitly allows for multi-municipal companies. Colombia empowered its regulator to
enforce mergers of nonviable local water agencies, but ironically exempted the smallest of
the municipalities that would have beneﬁted
most from this rule. Brazil’s state companies
were created through voluntary agreements
with municipalities, ﬁnanced by central funds.
These examples suggest an important
approach for aligning general decentralization with sectoral priorities. When authority
is being decentralized, a window usually
opens for central government to inﬂuence
the restructuring of local services. Decentralization gives the center the ability to negotiate
the restructuring of devolved assets through
ﬁscal incentives—say, by deciding to retain
the liabilities while devolving only the assets.
Where devolution has already happened,
the center can provide incentives such as
ﬁscal grants to subnational governments
that are dependent on milestones of institutional reform. Australia’s federal government provided grants to states to reform the
water sector. The South African government is also using central ﬁscal incentives to
support municipal restructuring and to
inﬂuence reform of urban services, including water and sanitation. India’s federal
government is exploring a similar policy
instrument—the City Challenge Fund—to
create incentives for general urban reform,
including municipal services.
Such ﬁscal incentives are more effective if
allocated competitively to local tiers of government. But this requires information so the
center can compare the performance of different local governments, promoting competition and accountability. It also requires that
the policy and legal framework enable local
governments to have the ﬂexibility to reform
service delivery—to form regional companies and use contracting, for example. Countries such as Pakistan and South Africa that
have recently embarked on decentralization
have adopted such legislation.

The bottom line: upper-tier governments
can inﬂuence the design of compacts at the
local level through legislation and incentives.
However, as demonstrated by experience in
Latin America, decentralization processes
have not always been designed with sufﬁcient care to allow these kinds of beneﬁts to
be reaped. The success of managing service
reforms during decentralization will depend
on whether broader decentralization policies
can ensure that local politicians and policymakers bear the consequences of policy decisions. Ensuring that decentralization can
separate policymakers and providers at the
local level requires that it also separate roles
and responsibilities of the different tiers of
government (chapter 10). Without that separation, decentralization may simply transfer
patronage to local levels.

Strengthening the compact:
using private participation
in operations
Over the past decade, private participation
has grown signiﬁcantly in water, sanitation,
and electricity in different forms and across
many regions (box 9.3). In general, private
participation in infrastructure has been
advocated for many reasons, including
accessing management expertise and private
investment and introducing incentives in the
operations of infrastructure services. Private
participation is also a direct way of separating policymakers and service providers
through two aspects of the accountability
chain—compacts and voice.
In the design of compacts, private providers generally require explicit contracts
that deﬁne up front the service responsibilities of the provider and the policymaker, the
regulatory and tariff parameters, and issues
of access by poor households. In addition,
the process of contracting private providers
can strengthen the voice channel, particularly if advocacy groups and public information mechanisms are involved in the process.
Indeed, service delivery standards and services for poor people are often explicit in the
policy debate on private participation in
water and sanitation.
In many industrial countries the involvement of the private sector in service delivery enabled governments to develop the

Private investment has been far higher in electricity than in water and
sanitation. Not surprisingly, the decline in private investment in the late
nineties was more pronounced in electricity. In both sectors, the impact
of “large deals” and country speciﬁc changes are visible—reﬂected also
in the geographic concentration—East Asia and Latin America—of pri-

vate investment. Finally, in electricity privatization dominates; in water,
management contract and concessions—public ownership—remains
the norm.

Private participation—in history

England. In London private companies supplied water for more than 400 years with little
government restriction on entry. Companies
competed against each other, invested in
service and quality innovations, and increased
household connections. By the 19th century
London’s extensive water system helped make
that city “one of the best housed and healthiest
cities in Europe, with a death rate lower than
birth rate by about 1800, at a time when most
European cities were devourers of men.” Ninetyﬁve percent of London residents received piped
supply from the private companies, and a majority had direct home connection.
Technological change led to signiﬁcant
price competition, industry consolidation, and
higher prices. And the improved water supply
increased demand for ﬂush toilets, which
created problems of sewage removal.
Parliament responded with regulation, and by
1908 the private system was nationalized. (In the
1980s England shifted back to private
provision.)
Holland. Between 1853 and 1920 the water
sector was dominated by private water supply

companies, which were then progressively
taken over by municipalities and operated as
public utilities.The amalgamation was
promoted by central regulation and facilitated
by municipal politics. A major motivation was to
use the companies to deliver services more
regionally to rural areas. By the time the public
sector took over, principles of economic management of water services had become well
embedded in the political system. Arms-length
management of public utilities by municipalities
became the norm.
United States. Between 1800 and 1900, U.S.
cities experienced a tremendous growth of
water works. Initially dominated by private owners, half of them were public by 1900.The shift
to public ownership emerged because of contracting problems between municipalities and
companies over water for ﬁre ﬁghting.The difﬁculties of establishing contracts when cities
were growing rapidly, and several urban conﬂagrations, offered opportunities for both private
companies and governments to evade performance targets or force renegotiations of
contracts. A lack of metering and direct charg-

capacity and political setting to regulate,
price, and manage water in public and private contexts (box 9.4). But in today’s developing countries private participation is being
ﬂung into a context of institutional rigidity,
not necessarily conducive to the organic
growth of formal private participation.
Using private provision to drive a wedge into
patronage makes managing private participation intensely political—but potentially
powerful for increasing accountability.
The proof of this potential is already evident. Formal private participation in water
and sanitation has led to greater demand for
accountability—this, despite accounting for a
small part of total investment in water and
sanitation. During the 1990s private investment accounted for only 15 percent of total
investment in water and sanitation, covering
less than 10 percent of the world’s population.
Even in Latin America, where private provision has made the greatest inroads in the
water sector, it only covers 15 percent of the
continent’s urban population.460 In addition,
in contrast to electricity, for example, public
ownership and not divestiture of assets
remains the norm in the sector.

ing led to conﬂicts over ﬁscal transfers from
municipalities to companies. Not surprisingly,
public ownership increased, and with it the public system inherited the tradition of managing
and regulating water as an economic good.
France. Starting with private provision of
water at the local government level and maintaining it from the mid-1600s onward, France
evolved toward public ownership and private
provision through different types of
management and lease contracts.The reasons:
scale issues (small local authorities), the history
of the French legal system, and the role of voice
in controlling policymakers.The issue of ﬁre
ﬁghting did not come up in France, perhaps
because cities were built with vastly different
materials and densities.
Sources: Tynan (2002), Schwartz and Maarten
(2002), Crocker and Mastens (2002), and Lorrain
(1992).

Ulitmately, like decentralization, private
provision offers an opportunity to inﬂuence
the relationships of accountability. And like
decentralization, its success depends on
design and implementation (box 9.5). Experience so far suggests that regulation and information—two interlinked parts of overall sector reform—are important in successfully
implementing private sector participation in
water, sanitation, and electricity sectors and in
promoting greater voice in service delivery.
Regulation. A regulatory system in this
Report’s framework is best deﬁned along the
dimensions of accountability between the policymaker and the provider—delegation of
responsibilities and ﬁnance, information
about the performance of the provider, and
enforcement (chapter 3). The regulator could
be responsible for speciﬁc elements of the
accountability chain—just providing information on performance or also ensuring enforcement. Sometimes the policymaker is the regulator, and sometimes a dedicated third party
has this responsibility. Sometimes even an
association of providers can self-regulate.
Whichever method is followed, the regulatory

Private participation in water and sanitation can save poor people’s lives, and money

In the 1990s Argentina embarked on one of the
largest privatization campaigns in the world as
part of a structural reform plan.The program
included local water companies covering
approximately 30 percent of the country’s
municipalities. Child mortality fell by 5–7
percent in areas that privatized their water services.The largest gains were seen in the poorest
municipalities, where child mortality fell by 24
percent. Overall, privatization of water services
prevented approximately 375 deaths of young
children each year.
Aggregate data from other sources on the
distribution of new water connection by
income quintile from three countries in Latin
America conﬁrm the results of the pro-poor
impact of private sector services. As the data
show, 25–30 percent of the network expansion
was targeted at the lowest 20 percent of the
income proﬁle.

process has to separate policymaker and
provider and preserve its own independence.
Organizing regulation: one size does not ﬁt
all. Where voice is strong and supported by
an effective legal system, the policymakers
and the judiciary do the regulating. In France,
where the compact for water is between
municipal policymakers and a private company, regulation is done primarily through
municipal monitoring of contracts, with
some support from central authorities.
In countries without a tradition of separating policymakers and providers and with
discretionary policymaking, credible regulation requires a third party—an agency—to
set or interpret regulatory rules. Several formal safeguards can support the independence of a regulatory agency from political
inﬂuence.461 Some examples: earmarking
funds for the regulatory agency, hiring staff
from the market without being restricted by
civil service rules (competence and capacity
are important elements of gaining credibility
and independence), ensuring that the hiring
and ﬁring of regulators are protected from
the political interference of the executive and
legislative branches, and not linking the
terms of staff to electoral cycles.
A multi-tiered governmental structure
offers additional scope for protecting the independence of a regulator by placing it at the

Responding to the need for alternatives for
reaching poor people, one of the Manila concessionaires has developed a system for water delivery in densely populated, hard-to-reach slum
areas. In the Bayan Tubig (“Water for the Community”) program, the use of appropriate technological standards, client participation in maintenance,
and community-based organizations in intermediation and mapping of the network reduced
water costs for poor families by up to 25 percent.
To increase affordability, the concessionaire has
introduced an interest-free repayment scheme
over a period of 6 to 24 months. Between 1991
and 2001, the program provided water connections to more than 50,000 households—this
despite the fact that the contract of one of the
Manila concessionaires is under review.

national level, or at the state level if policymaking and provision are done at the local level.
Another option in a multi-tiered government
is to use local regulation but have the appeals
process at a different level. In the United States
the Constitution provides an overall framework for property rights while state regulatory
commissions oversee the operations of privately owned local utilities. Local governments
regulate public utilities directly.
Regulation and sector reform. The accountability framework clariﬁes the conditions
under which a regulator will be effective in
supporting sector reforms. Just as accountability is blurred if any one of its relationships
is broken (see chapter 3), the effectiveness of
a regulator is abridged if delegation of
responsibilities and ﬁnance between the state
and the provider is incomplete. That is the
case in the electricity sector in some states in
India. In other words, an independent regulator is needed to enforce the separation
between policymaker and provider, but if the
separation is not initiated through general
reform to begin with, the regulator may well
be ineffective. A regulator cannot substitute
for broader sector reforms.
At the same time an effective regulator can
help sustain sector reform. A recent study of
about 1,000 concessions in Latin America
showed that even a moderately well-func-

19_WDR_Ch09.qxd 8/14/03 10:06 AM Page 169

tioning regulator can temper opportunistic
renegotiations of contracts.462 The study concludes that where a regulatory body exists in a
country, the probability of a renegotiation is
17 percent; where none exists, the probability
is 60 percent.
Regulating the public sector. Sector regulation is often discussed in the context of private sector participation. But issues of
monopoly behavior and service performance
are also relevant for public sector provision—
perhaps even more, because the contracts
between the policymaker and the public
provider are often not explicit. Independent
regulation of public providers is therefore
equally important. But unless public
providers have operational ﬂexibility and are
brought under explicit compacts—and
unless all the relationships of accountability
are applied—it is not clear how regulation of
the public providers would have an impact
on service standards. In particular, because
most of the instruments of modern regulation are based on ﬁnancial incentives, in the
absence of user charges regulation of public
providers would be ineffective. In Chile public sector regulation was introduced in the
context of sector reforms, which included
greater provider autonomy in operations and
economic pricing of water. This helped catalyze regulatory capacity in the public sector—an important asset, now that Chile has
privatized water services.
The role of information. With private provision more needs to be done to deliver on the
demand for greater voice—informing communities about the why and how of private
sector contracting. A public opinion poll in
Peru found support for privatization of electricity among only 21 percent of the citizens.
But when informed that privatization was to
be undertaken through a transparent process
and tariff increases would be regulated, support increased to 60 percent.463 In Manila the
concession process was preceded by a widespread public campaign by President Ramos,
who convened “Water Summits” to bring
together different stakeholders.464 In South
Africa Johannesburg’s water management
contract was also undertaken after signiﬁcant—and often difﬁcult—consultation with

communities, labor unions, and other interest
groups. Neither process was ﬂawless, but both
opened the door to greater accountability. An
open process is needed to broaden the participation of communities in the policy debate
on private provision—otherwise narrow
interest groups can capture the information
and representation.
Community involvement is also essential
in the regulatory process—but it has not been
sufﬁciently encouraged. A review of urban
water utilities in Latin America and Africa
concludes that giving consumers little information about the process of reform and tariff
setting—and limiting their opportunity for
comment before taking regulatory decisions—weaken the regulatory process and
the credibility of reform, and make tariff
changes—however justiﬁed—difﬁcult to
implement.465
Organizing consumers is, however, not an
easy task. There are major free-rider (and
related ﬁnancing) problems in developing
countries that prevent consumers from organizing themselves to a degree where they can
be an articulate voice in the regulatory
process. The problem is even more severe for
poor consumers. In industrialized countries,
relatively well-developed consumer associations perform this role reasonably effectively.
Where competent and effective consumer
associations are absent, the asymmetry
between consumers and providers becomes
more acute, and the regulator risks being captured by the provider.
Examples exist of regulatory bodies engaging communities—especially poor communities—more actively. In Jamaica the regulator
reaches out to communities through local
churches; in some cases in Brazil special consultative or advisory bodies have been created;
and in Peru regulators have made extensive
use of the radio to engage and communicate
with communities.466 But these are few examples only—much more needs to be learned
about how to organize and access communities in the regulation of services.
Managing private participation also requires information on how private players
are performing relative to their contract
and the performance of other public and
private providers. This information, which
is critical for regulators, also strengthens the

relationship between citizens, politicians, and
policymakers. For private provision to have a
catalytic impact on the sector, information is
essential on the performance of both the
public and private sectors. But too little information has been available on the performance of the public sector and through few
credible sources. Leveling the playing ﬁeld
between public and private providers—as
discussed later—and benchmarking their
performance are essential in getting the best
out of private participation in the sector.
Overall, the impact of private sector participation is best leveraged within a broader
reform context—greater separation of policymakers and providers for all public providers;
greater participation of communities in the
process of private participation and in the
regulatory framework; and greater use of
benchmarking of both public and private
providers. The Australian approach is instructive. An enabling framework and a
national competition law level the playing
ﬁeld for all public and private providers. Sectoral legislation provides guidelines for service
provision. The central government provides
ﬁscal incentives to support change at the state
level. A variety of delivery approaches are supported—corporatization (Melbourne), management contract (Adelaide), vertically integrated public utility (Sydney), multi-utility
(Canberra). Regulation differs between states
and is backed by independent regulatory
agencies as well as benchmarking done
through an association of water providers.

BOX 9.6

Charging for
water—in history

Treating water as an economic good and charging for services enabled France and the Netherlands to use private provision to jump-start the
sector’s development. In France the private sector remains the major service provider of water
and sanitation services. In the Netherlands the
system shifted from the private to the public
sector. But in both countries charging users for
water remained the norm, which enabled
providers to sustain service delivery at arm’s
length from local government and gave them
greater incentives to be responsive to the needs
of the clients.
Sources: Lorrain (1992); Blokland, Braadbaart, and
Schwartz (1999).

Strengthening client power:
charging for services
User charges provide operational autonomy
for the provider, support client power, and
elicit greater accountability from the state (box
9.6). Without access to enough revenues from
the clients, service providers depend on the
policymaker for ﬁscal resources to maintain
service provision. In addition, if the seller is
not dependent on the buyer for at least some
part of revenues, the provider will have little
incentive to respond to the client. At the same
time, given the politics of water pricing, implementing user charges can quickly elicit a consumer response—as in Johannesburg, Manila,
and very visibly in Cochabamba, Bolivia.
Implementing user charges. Drawing on the
power of user charges to leverage accountability in service delivery requires, as discussed
earlier, effective regulation to address monopoly provision. But more importantly, the critical policy issue is how to increase tariffs. There
are two implementation issues: the ﬁrst is synchronizing tariffs with quality improvements,
and the second is ensuring that there is a safety
net to safeguard basic affordability.
In many countries, bringing the tariffs to
cost-recovery levels would require signiﬁcant
adjustment and rebalancing of tariffs among
residential, business, and industrial customers. In Indian cities the charges on residential users are less than a tenth of the operating and maintenance costs. Industrial users
pay ten times more but are below the benchmark for operating and maintenance costs in
two-thirds of the metropolitan cities and 80
percent of smaller cities.467 Even if there is a
willingness to charge, how can the transition
to prices be managed?
Charging cannot be assessed independent
of the broader policy framework and the
credibility of service providers. Policymakers
are obviously concerned that services will not
improve enough to justify the price increases.
Central to a price increase is what comes
ﬁrst—the increases or service improvement?
Guinea entered a lease contract for water services in its major towns and cities in 1989.
During the ﬁrst six years of the contract, the
government subsidized a declining share of
the private operator’s costs while tariffs were
adjusted gradually toward cost recovery,

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

19_WDR_Ch09.qxd 8/14/03 10:07 AM Page 171

Drinking water, sanitation, and electricity

which avoided a major tariff shock. This
jump-started the move to cost recovery and
better service delivery. It also gave the reform
credibility in a region that had little experience with private provision.468 For various
reasons the lease contract expired in 1999 and
was not renewed, but the pricing strategy
remains relevant for other countries.
Similarly, subsidies to poor people could
be better targeted and designed, which
would enable user charges to be implemented overall. Chile has a nationally
funded household water subsidy. Colombia
uses geographic targeting. South Africa has a
national lifeline tariff system that guarantees
each household 6 kiloliters of water a
month.469 Given the substantial divergence
between piped water prices and the high cost
of the inferior alternatives that many of the
poorest are forced to use, there is often a
strong case for giving highest priority to connection subsidies rather than subsidizing the
use of water by those who already enjoy
access to the piped network. Connection
subsidies also have the advantage that they
are easier to target (since lacking access to
service is already a strong indicator of
poverty) and cheaper to administer (since
relatively large one-time payments are
involved). Generally it is more efﬁcient to
subsidize the connection costs for lowincome households, but there are alternative
options for designing connection and consumption charges that beneﬁt poor people.
Ultimately, tariff adjustment and subsidy
mechanisms are technocratic tools that can
be designed and applied in many ways. What
is critical is to turn payments for services into
a political tool for reducing patronage and
strengthening client power of poor people.

Strengthening client power: relying
on independent providers
As the example of pit operators in Dar-esSalaam suggests, small independent providers are a common feature in providing
water and sanitation services across income
groups. Their organization varies from
household vendors of water, small network
providers, and private entrepreneurs to cooperatives. In some cases they are the primary
suppliers, and in others they supplement the
formal provider. In some cases they are part

of a competitive market, and in others they
are controlled by a few groups.
Enhancing the role of independent
providers as part of the short route of
accountability is a key policy challenge. How
can this be achieved?470 By recognizing independent providers and giving them legal status, by ensuring that network providers are
not given exclusive supply, by enabling
greater partnership between formal public
and private network providers and small
independents, by ensuring that the regulatory
framework for network providers gives the
ﬂexibility to enable contracting with independent providers, by enabling small-scale
provider associations and working with these
umbrella bodies to introduce appropriate
levels of regulation, and by enabling poor
people to gain access to multiple independent
providers while keeping their regulation
more focused on health and issues related to
groundwater depletion.
Of particular concern is the effect of
bringing in a formal private provider in an
area dominated by independent providers.
This issue was not addressed in the design of
the Cochabamba contract—where the private provider was given exclusivity rights—
and it contributed to the contract’s cancellation.471 In reality, if coverage targets are
deﬁned in such a way that they can be met
with the services of small independent
providers, the operator will have an incentive
to encourage their involvement.

Rural areas: network
and non-network systems
Rural settings are complex in their settlement
patterns, ranging from dense settlements in
South Asia to dispersed communities in many
African countries. Suppliers include household systems in Bangladesh, water vendors in
Laos, and community-managed local piped
water systems in Ghana. Across all situations,
the client-provider link is the norm. Understanding why the long route of accountability
is needed to support this client power, and
how this can be done, are the main service
delivery challenges in rural areas.

Community-managed networks
In countries as diverse as India and Kenya,
water boards or engineering departments

have traditionally been responsible for
delivering water services to rural communities. Top-down in their approach, with little
skill in community mobilization, and
backed by ﬁscal support from central government, the boards scaled up physical
investment. But they had little success in
ensuring sustainable operations and maintenance. Indeed, these boards face the same
problems of state capture inherent in the
patronage model of service delivery.
Given the failures of top-down institutions, some countries are shifting to community-managed systems—often supported
by donors, as in India and Ghana. Communities are involved in the design and management of their water systems, paying for
operations and maintenance costs. Governments, generally central governments, pay a
signiﬁcant part of the capital costs. Donorfunded project management units, backed
by not-for-proﬁt organizations, often form
the technical and organizational backbone
of these systems.
The client-based model puts the client at
the center of the accountability relationship, but many challenges remain in scaling
it up.472

•

Communities require technical support
in the medium to long run to manage
water systems, and donor-funded project management units are not well
suited for this.
Communities pay for current operating
costs, but replenishing capital investments and covering higher tariffs—to
pay for rising power costs, for example—
are not easily managed through group
contributions.
Communities are not homogeneous—
problems of exclusion and elite capture
can be the same as in government systems. And different communities may
have differing abilities to form cohesive
groups.
Efﬁcient technologies that require scale
economies are not selected because of
the focus on village-level associations.

Supporting client provision
Three approaches—local governments, regional utilities, and independent providers—

provide examples of institutional mechanisms for supporting community-based systems. They are all “works in progress,” and
learning from them will offer insights on
how to advance rural community-based systems of delivery.
Local governments can form the institutional and ﬁnancial support for expanding
community-based systems. With access to a
tax base, local governments can provide
resources to cover periodic capital expenditure, provide temporary ﬁscal support to
communities to adjust to economic shocks,
and facilitate access to technical assistance.
Uganda and South Africa provide examples
of arrangements in which local governments are part of a larger ﬁscal decentralization program with own resources and
greater autonomy. Local governments thus
strengthened can support communitybased programs. Even in India, where local
panchayats do not have as much autonomy,
the relations between local governments
and user groups are evolving. Where neighboring small towns have effective providers,
these can be contracted in by rural local
governments to support their communities.
In Côte d’Ivoire a national utility run by
a private partner has responsibilities for
urban centers and smaller towns. The
national utility uses cross subsidies—with
the capital city providing the ﬁscal surplus—to support the smaller urban centers.
Expansion of its responsibilities to rural
areas is now being tried. The early lessons
have not been successful but the approach is
still evolving.473
Finally, communities can contract with a
third party or an independent provider to
manage local network systems. In China
formal cooperatives (rural companies) run
on commercial principles with very high
cost recovery.474 In several African countries
village entrepreneurs manage water systems
under contract. In East Asia small independent providers are being organized to take
on operational responsibility on a concession basis. In each case, the process is organized through group consultation and
endorsement. While small systems can be
contracted by community organizations,
villagewide systems may again require the
support of policymakers at the local level.

Drinking water, sanitation, and electricity

Self-provision. Households managing wells
and hand pumps are common in large parts
of rural Asia and Africa. Nowhere is selfprovision more dramatically showcased
than in Bangladesh, where shallow aquifers
and the market provision of hand pumps
enabled households to directly manage
water services and replace pathogen-contaminated surface water with groundwater.
Service delivery improved—less waiting
time, no quantity limits, and the convenience of household connection. And the
health impact, which included a decline in
diarrhea-related deaths, was remarkable.
Missing was any attempt to monitor
water quality. Finding arsenic in the
groundwater caught everyone by surprise.
The government had withdrawn from the
rural water sector, assuming that access was
now fully addressed by the private market
and household efforts directly. In addition,
in a unitary system of government, there
was no local government to respond to the
crisis. In rural Bangladesh today, a policymaker is needed to support communities,
manage externalities, and understand the
technological choices for addressing the
arsenic crisis (box 9.7). More broadly, for a
collective good such as the monitoring of
water quality, a partnership between clients

and providers will not sufﬁce; policymakers
are needed to support communities

Sanitation
Policy issues in sanitation need to be discussed in the context of the private and public goods dimensions of the sector. To the
extent it is primarily a client-provider relationship, households invest in sanitation
systems and contract independent providers
for the removal of excreta. To the extent the
public goods dimensions are dominant, policymakers need to support collective action
to change behavior at the household and
community levels, and organize common
infrastructure for excreta removal.
Access to sanitation services has often
been seen as an issue of subsidizing latrines
and prescribing latrine technology. This
supply-driven approach, emphasizing the
ﬁscal and engineering aspects of sanitation,
has failed. In response, some countries have
been shifting toward “complete sanitation”—focusing on community and household behavior and sanitation practices.475
This involves breaking the fecal-oral chain
by encouraging households to change
behavior—shifting away from open defecation, washing hands, keeping food and
water covered, using safe water, focusing on

Fighting arsenic by listening to rural communities

The arsenic contamination of shallow aquifers
may be undoing the success of rural drinking
water provision in Bangladesh. While the number of individuals showing symptoms of arsenic
poisoning is still low—despite the high concentration of arsenic in the water—between 25 and
30 million people may be at risk in the future.
The ﬁrst response to the crisis by
government and many donors was denial.This
was followed by an effort to test all water
sources and hand pumps.There were various
technological and logistical problems—which is
not surprising in view of the fact that arsenic
contamination of this scale has not been faced
anywhere in the world.These problems were
further complicated by a lack of coordination
and blurring of roles among government,
donors, and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs).
The efforts so far have revealed that surface
water does not contain arsenic and that not all

aquifers are contaminated. Government, donors,
and NGOs are advocating several options: shifting to alternative water sources, including some
surface sources; sharing of uncontaminated
tubewells in villages; sinking deep tubewells in
public areas; and promoting household ﬁltering
technologies.The latter, if successful, would preserve the use of shallow tubewells—decentralized, household means of water access—that
have deﬁned the “water miracle” of Bangladesh.
In all of this, little effort was made to understand
the preferences of rural households.
A WSP-BRAC (Water and Sanitation
Program–Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) team undertook a comprehensive survey of household preferences for different
approaches to arsenic mitigation in selected
areas of rural Bangladesh.The results reveal that
communities place a high premium on convenience. Unless the alternatives are as convenient
as the current hand pumps, the shift to dug

wells, well-sharing, and other mechanism may
not work. Indeed they have not yet been
successful as solutions.
Communities strongly indicated a
preference and willingness to pay for
centralized, community-based ﬁltering systems,
such as local piped-water systems with a central
ﬁltering point for chemical and biological contaminants.The piped water network systems
introduced in the Bogra area by the Rural Development Academy suggest the potential of such
systems in Bangladesh.This has been conﬁrmed
by preliminary data, which show the cost effectiveness of piped water in settlements that have
300 or more households. If implemented
broadly, this approach would dramatically
change the nature of water institutions in rural
Bangladesh—a change that communities are
willing to undertake.

children’s hygiene behavior and maintaining a clean environment. The use of
hygienic latrines is a result of this process of
changing behavior.
Because the health impact of a household’s sanitation practices is affected not
only by the household’s behavior but also by
the practices of the community, there is a
collective action problem. The provider’s
role in ensuring information and social support to households through community
structures becomes critical. Success depends
on making people see themselves as a community, where every member’s behavior
affects the other—a daunting challenge and
perhaps the reason why sanitation has
always lagged behind demand for water.

A participatory focus in rural areas
Because communities need to manage sanitation collectively, innovative participatory
approaches are required to generate
demand for it, especially in dispersed settlements. The shift from open to ﬁxed-point
defecation may be motivated by health,
safety, and privacy concerns—issues of
importance to women, who bear much of
the burden of poor sanitation practices. In
the approach practiced by Village Education Resource Center (VERC) and WaterAid in Bangladesh, an external group triggers community-wide recognition of the
need for better sanitation practices. The
community then takes responsibility for
self-regulation—motivating households to
strive for complete sanitation. In East and
South Asia this has even led to innovations
in latrine technology and micro-credit
ﬁnancing for investments in latrines and
associated infrastructure.
Subsidies. The community focus also
changes the approach to latrine subsidies. In
Bangladesh, villages in the VERC/WaterAid
project did not require any external subsidy.
To assist low-income households, higherincome households provided resources.
Once communities focused on the need for
collective responsibility, assisting individual
households to reach community goals was
more readily accepted. In Vietnam the participatory approach was supported by a subsidy targeted at poorer households.

But even if a subsidy is required, the ﬁscal contribution could be delivered to the
community, rewarding collective action,
self-regulation, and the elimination of
open defecation. Take one of India’s
largest states—Maharashtra state, with 97
million people. It subsidized latrine construction by households below the poverty
line only to discover that close to 45 percent of the latrines were not being used.
So it shifted its subsidy to a competitive
scheme (the Gadge Baba scheme) that
rewarded communities for good sanitation practices, using an information campaign to deﬁne the principles of sanitation
and publicizing the names of winning villages. Reputation, recognition, and community rewards became the catalyst. Over
a short period an estimated 100,000
household latrines were built, and for
every rupee of state resources, local
spending on sanitation and related infrastructure increased by 35 rupees.
Local compacts. Making the shift to better
sanitation practices is the ﬁrst objective—
but sustaining the shift is equally important. The local externalities and the need to
understand and draw on local conditions
and knowledge suggest that local governments are the appropriate policymaker tier.
In Vietnam and West Bengal, India, local
governments have supported community
participation and ensured its continuity by
ﬁnancing the work of the service provider,
usually a not-for-proﬁt organization. In
Vietnam some local governments have used
a program similar to Maharashtra state’s
Gadge Baba scheme to acknowledge village
and individual achievements.

Responding to demand
in urban areas
Households in urban settlements with high
population densities often show a greater
demand for better sanitation facilities. The
condominial systems in São Paulo, Brazil,
and the community sanitation systems of
Orangi in Karachi, Pakistan, and Parivartan
in Ahmedabad, India, suggest that informal
urban communities may be willing to manage and pay for efﬁcient systems of sanitation
and waste disposal. Small independent

19_WDR_Ch09.qxd 8/14/03 10:09 AM Page 175

Drinking water, sanitation, and electricity

providers serving households directly, as in
Dar-es-Salaam, show that urban households
do invest in sanitation. So what are the
impediments to expanding these approaches?
The answer may lie outside the realm of
water and sanitation—and in the regulatory
domain of urban centers. First, the formal
recognition of informal communities by governments and the provision of some form of
tenure have strongly inﬂuenced community
willingness to invest in household infrastructure and to work collectively on community
infrastructure (La Paz in Bolivia, Ahmedabad
in India). Research on garbage collection in
informal settlements in Indonesia provides
empirical evidence of the negative relationship between incomplete property rights and
community investment in local public
goods.476 It suggests that improving tenure
security increases the probability of garbage
collection by 32–44 percent.
Second, in dense urban areas the municipal government’s willingness to allocate some
public land to sanitation systems has enabled
communities to develop community facilities, contracting them with a third party to
maintain and operate them (Pune in India).
Use is restricted to the community through a
monthly charge collected by the community
and paid to the operator.
Third, municipal laws need to support
ﬂexible standards and ensure that communities and households can make arrangements
with independent providers. Laws that permit exclusive service provision need to be
replaced by laws that permit different
approaches and standards.
A concluding caveat is, however, necessary on the discussion about sanitation. Historical evidence suggests that demand for
water and sanitation follows a sequencing—
water ﬁrst, followed by sanitation and then
demand for waste water treatment. Experience also suggests that this sequencing is
inﬂuenced by many factors of which service
delivery arrangements in the sector is only
one. In this context, policymakers must
remain realistic and patient about how far
they can catalyze the demand for sanitation
through external interventions. Unless embedded in a demand-responsive approach,
throwing subsidies at latrines will not resolve
the challenge of scaling up sanitation.

175

Electricity
Like water, electricity has urban and rural
components—and issues of managing grid
and off-grid systems. In the grid setting, the
issues of separating the policymaker from
the provider, charging for services, using
private providers, and developing effective
regulatory systems are similar to water network issues (box 9.8).477 A key difference is
unbundling (rather than decentralizing)
services.
For electricity in rural settings, the
extension of the grid network provides
lessons for managing non-network systems
in water. And the emerging use of off-grid
electricity systems can draw on lessons from
community-managed water in rural settings.
Grid systems. The experience from Latin
America, Eastern Europe, and South Asia
suggests that unbundling the electricity
chain into generation, transmission, and

Unlike water and sanitation coverage, electricity coverage has increased signiﬁcantly over the
past decade. But like water and sanitation, electricity faces daunting challenges in South Asia
and Africa and rural areas across most regions in the world. And as in the case of water and
sanitation, increased electricity coverage does not automatically imply efﬁcient service delivery.The problems of theft, intermittent supply, shared access—captured broadly under the
heading of electricity losses—make wires no different from pipes in the context of creating
accountability in service delivery.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

distribution components is critical to
reforms in the sector—but only if the market
is large enough to support multiple electricity
generators, and hence genuine competition.478 Unbundling provides scope for competition in the relevant sectors, primarily
generation. Separating the components also
creates scope for getting better information
about the cost structure of each part of the
chain. The competition and the information
add to client power.
But transmission and distribution functions are monopolies, and without effective
regulation it may be difﬁcult to ensure the
separation of policymaker and provider, and
even reduce the scope to introduce competition in generation. Unless distribution is
transferred to different types of ownership, a
national or regional government as a sole
owner will not have much incentive to separate its policymaking responsibilities from the
operations of the distribution system.
Privatizing distribution is a common policy approach, but decentralizing electricity
assets to local governments is not generally
considered. Even where local governments
own distribution systems—as in South
Africa—the policy discussion is about consolidating into regional distribution systems.
This is driven by economies of scale and
scope, and perhaps also by policy decisions to
cross-subsidize from urban to rural settings
and to keep the cross subsidy in the sector.
Interestingly, in Mumbai and Kolkata, India,
where electricity is under local governments,
electricity provision has long been under private operation. Even in Delhi—in effect a
city-state—power distribution is now private.
Rural grid. The extension of the grid into
rural areas offer insights for rural water and
off-grid electricity with regard to reestablishing the relationship between policymaker
and service providers. A model of rural
cooperatives has emerged in the United
States and is being adapted in Bangladesh
and the Philippines. A regional or national
provider organization contracts with community cooperatives to be village-level distributors. In Bangladesh the Rural Electricity
Board (REB) supports the village cooperatives through technical assistance and ﬁscal

transfers for a part of the capital costs. This
would be similar to using regional water utilities to support community-managed water
systems. Importantly, the owner of the distribution is not the policymaker but the clients.
Unbundling the national REB into regional
REBs, with some form of benchmarking,
could support the clients in breaking a possible monopolistic relationship between the
REB and the cooperatives.
Rural off-grid. Rural provider organizations—or local governments—can also support off-grid systems in villages, in many
cases using renewable energy to generate
power. Donors have traditionally advocated
solar household systems—not unlike the
technology push in latrines. But today’s
renewable systems can support villagewide
grids—similar to villagewide piped water systems—to provide AC electricity for household appliances of various types. Depending
on local conditions the systems can also be
wind-powered, solar, tidal, bio-gas, or hybrid,
with fossil-fueled generators as backup.

Given the weak voice relationship between
citizens and politicians in the water, sanitation, and electricity sectors, deep institutional
reform often comes from broader stresses in
the economic, political, and institutional
machinery of a country. In London pollution
was such a cause. In Johannesburg the city’s
bankruptcy was the impetus. In cities in
Africa and Latin America a core impulse for
reform of urban water and sanitation is the
combination of sector problems and a
macroeconomic crisis.480
Society’s view of economic development is
also important. In Australia, Chile, and Peru,
growth-driven economic development strategy provided the impetus for improving the
performance of water and power markets. So
the possibilities for sector reform seem greatest when there is a conﬂuence of natural challenge, ﬁscal crisis, and institutional reform-

mindedness.479 Opportunities for reform may
well arrive only by chance, when broader
changes in turn catalyze sectoral reforms.
What are the potential interim measures? Can
incremental change be strategic?
For urban networks, change will require
separating the delivery functions from those
of benchmarking and regulation. Keeping
the latter with an upper-tier government—
central or regional—while dispersing ownership of water and sanitation assets to
lower-tier governments and the private sector could create this separation. Without
ownership responsibilities, the upper-tier
policymaker would have greater incentives
to use ﬁscal instruments, benchmarking,
and regulation to promote improvements in
service provision. Such incentives are less
inherent in a model where the regulator,
provider, and owner are one and the same.
Charging users for services strengthens this
separation by directly involving clients in
the service chain through the short route of
accountability.
Where the introduction of private sector
participation is tempered by politics or other
factors, strategic change may have to come
ﬁrst through changes in ownership and relationships of accountability between tiers of
the public sector. Interestingly, the history of
some industrialized countries suggests that
local ownership can trigger a more credible
path to private sector participation, especially
if local governments are effective in strengthening voice.
Where local governments exist and water
and sanitation services have been devolved to
local governments, the challenge of improved
service delivery would lie in making decentralization work. Where local governments
do not exist, the lever of decentralized ownership would be lost, but benchmarking and
regulation of the public sector would remain.
But for such a strategy to be effective, charging for water would become even more critical. It would enable providers to achieve
some independence in operations, but more
importantly it would give clients a role in sus-

taining the separation and ensuring that the
regulation of public providers is effective. In
this context, introducing private players in a
few of the utilities would enhance the effectiveness of benchmarking the public
providers.
Where this broader approach of making
services work for all is not possible, a targeted
approach for serving poor people using small
independent providers is still an option.
Indeed, increasingly independent providers
may, at the margin, emerge as a critical lever
for making services work for poor people.
For rural systems—community-managed
systems and self-provision—the challenge is
to seek mechanisms for the policymaker to
support client power, using local governments, regional utilities, and independent
providers. This is similar to the model of the
rural electricity cooperatives supported by a
provider organization that provides a technical and ﬁscal hub. Where local governments
provide this hub, the voice channel is direct;
where utilities are the support mechanism,
the voice channel is indirect. Where these
options are not possible, the approach—
however unsatisfactory—of targeted community projects remains.
For sanitation, the focus is on collective
action—to change behavior and mobilize
communities to invest in community infrastructure. To support this, compacts between
policymakers and NGOs may be more
appropriate. In urban areas, where greater
demand for sanitation services may exist,
policymakers can support client power by
allowing independent providers to function
and by supporting tenure in informal settlements. A more incremental version would be
similar to that in the rural water sector—with
a public provider organization supporting
NGO delivery in targeted areas.
But if the failure of voice is why infrastructure services have failed poor people,
targeted intervention cannot form the basis
of institutional reform. Reforming the relationships of accountability would remain the
policy challenge.

Accountability in city services
In 1999 the Transformation Lekgotla, the political body directed to address the ﬁnancial and institutional crisis of Johannesburg, South Africa, appointed a new city management team. The team’s task was clear: not to ﬁx street lights but to ﬁx
the institutions that ﬁx street lights.482 The solution was a three-year plan—“iGoli 2002”—to reconﬁgure city services.483

B

y most developing world standards
Johannesburg is not a poor city. But
it faces serious development and
service delivery challenges. Apartheid made
sure that exclusive white suburbs were well
serviced, forcing black residents into
sprawling underdeveloped slums. Poverty,
unemployment, and homelessness are all
worsened by the deeper problem of
inequality.
The Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality was democratically elected in 1995 to
address the service imbalances. It quickly
found itself in a ﬁscal and institutional crisis.
Johannesburg was not one institution
but ﬁve, with an overarching Metropolitan
Council and four primary-level councils.
Each could decide its priorities and approve
its budget. But responsibilities for key services were split between the two levels, and
the operating budgets of the councils had to
balance only in aggregate. That meant each
council could blissfully spend on the
assumption that its shortfalls would be offset by surpluses in another.
The arrangement was a recipe for disaster. Each municipality went on a spending
spree, and ambitious infrastructure plans
were rolled out without the ﬁnance. Deteriorating revenues—due to a service-payment
boycott culture left over from antiapartheid struggles, poverty, and poor credit
control—made the situation worse. The city
was forced to delve into its reserves, but
these could go only so far, and by late 1997
major creditors could no longer be paid. At
the peak of the crisis, the city had an operating deﬁcit of R314 million.
Johannesburg was in serious trouble.
Having decentralized responsibilities, the
national government followed the intergovernmental rules and would not bail the city
out. So Johannesburg had to dig itself out
of its own crisis.
Two years of harsh cutbacks followed.
Blaming ofﬁcials for the crisis, politicians
took a much tighter rein over day-to-day
decisions, ending management discretion.

They slashed capital and operating budgets,
and even expenditures needed to maintain
minimum service levels. They froze posts,
causing huge increases in workloads as
despairing ofﬁcials began to drift away. And
they began to explore public-private partnerships.

independent, single-purpose entities to
overhaul larger municipal services.
These operating entities were the major
innovation of iGoli 2002.
•

Three utilities were established for user
charge–based services—water and sanitation, electricity, and waste management.

The city of gold—iGoli 2002

•

The new city management team realized
that Johannesburg needed a new system of
accountability for service delivery within a
dramatically different institutional architecture. To address fragmentation and the
severe moral hazard, the city had to be
reuniﬁed. Political debate focused on two
models of metropolitan coordination:

Two agencies were established—for
parks and cemeteries, and for roads and
storm water—where expenditure would
still have to be covered by tax revenue.

•

Smaller corporatized units were set up
for facilities like the zoo and the civic
theater.

•

Deﬁning more clearly the rules of budgeting, ﬁscal transfers, and service delivery between the metropolitan and
municipal tiers, strengthening both.

•

Creating a one-tier metropolitan government.484

Johannesburg chose a hybrid. It centralized political authority, treasury management, and spatial planning under one metropolitan government. But it organized
service delivery through decentralized
structures. This meant merging ﬁve separate councils into one overarching municipality, creating integrated service delivery
structures with new incentives.

Accountability in service delivery
Under one metropolitan council, iGoli 2002
split the institution for policy formulation
and regulation from the institutions for
implementation. On one side, a core administration remained responsible for strategic
planning, contract administration, and such
corporate services as ﬁnance, planning, and
communication. On the other, two sets of
operating entities were established: 11 new
regional administrations for libraries,
health, recreation, and other community
services; and ﬁnancially ring-fenced, semi-

All were established as new companies,
with the council as sole shareholder.
Two key units would guide and oversee
the new entities: a corporate planning
unit to do citywide strategic planning, and
a contract management unit to regulate
the operating utilities through a range
of new instruments, including licensing
agreements and annual service level
agreements.

One size does not ﬁt all
Since the operating entities are not bound
by overarching administrative rules, they
have scope to differentiate. Each could set
up different management structures,
reporting lines, delegations, job descriptions, performance management systems,
and operating procedures. Each could conﬁgure its internal accountability to suit a
speciﬁc service delivery environment.
Three examples:
•

The water and sanitation departments
were merged into one department and
under the Company’s Law converted
into a city-owned utility with a board of
directors. The assets and workers of the
departments were transferred to the
utility, which was put under a ﬁve-year
management contract with a private
company.

•

The roads department was converted
into a city-owned agency with a professional board and divided into two
departments—for planning and for
contracts. The contracts department
operated against speciﬁc outcomes set
by the planning department, with the
threat that failing to meet benchmarks
could lead to contracting tasks out to
the private sector.
The gas company was sold to the private
sector.

The reforms gave operating entities
management independence. For example,
salaries have been adjusted to attract topﬂight skills, and new systems have been
procured for everything from human
resource management to remote waterpressure metering—increasing productivity and service efﬁciency. And they have
introduced innovative staff development
programs and performance-linked pay
schemes.
The entities operate at arm’s length from
the council, but accountability has been
strengthened because the primary mechanism is no longer the impossible-to-digest
committee report on everyday operational
matters. Now councilors focus on strategic
oversight, and ofﬁcials are responsible for
outcomes clearly deﬁned in service-level
agreements. Reporting goes through structured channels, either to the contract management unit or to company boards of
directors, which include external specialists
capable of probing service results.
The operating entities have also set up
user forums allowing communities to communicate needs, raise complaints, and even
participate actively in service provision.
Ofﬁcials are much more sensitive to everchanging service delivery challenges.
These management improvements are
already translating into better service delivery. Waste collection has been extended to
poorer neighborhoods for the ﬁrst time.
Fleets of new buses now serve outlying
communities. In addition, expenditure on
water infrastructure has increased and
water services have expanded. Results are

Risks and prospects
Will Johannesburg maintain the separation
between policymaking, providers, and regulators? The roles of client and contractor
are still evolving. Some implementation
capacity remains within the core administration. As in the past, managers occasionally get hauled into councilors’ ofﬁces to
explain their actions. There are also unresolved governance debates, with the council
arguing for a greater councilor representation on the boards of operating entities.
Five factors will be critical in sustaining
the commitment to the principles of iGoli
2002:
•

Keeping the monitoring and regulatory
unit of the operating entities within the
city administration; they are not legally
and administratively independent.

•

Maintaining the contract management
unit’s operational autonomy and capacity—and thus the independence of the
operating entities.

•

Benchmarking service delivery standards, monitoring these over time, and
making the information available.

•

Ensuring that ﬁscal and ﬁnancial decentralization remains binding. Municipalities relying primarily on their own revenue sources to fulﬁll their democratic
duties without national guarantees are
more likely to be accountable to their
citizens. The current intergovernmental
system has devolved authority and
accountability to the cities; this needs to
remain.

•

Both councilors and ofﬁcials consistently
adhering to a clear, courageous, and farsighted strategy. Sustaining momentum
will require greater citizen voice at all levels. The decentralized operating entities
and the administrative regions have
mechanisms for engaging citizens. Using
them will be critical for sustaining iGoli
2002.

also apparent in the city’s ﬁnancial standing, with dramatic improvement in both
operating and capital budgets (ﬁgure 1).

Engaging other stakeholders
Labor: Despite protracted negotiations
with organized labor, iGoli 2002 did not get
its endorsement. According to labor groups,
the city’s crisis was not a result of a failure
of institutional design. Instead it was a
result of “a lack of skills and experience,
and management’s unwillingness to
[establish] functional organizations and . . .
ﬁnancially unsound decisions.”485

National government: The team negotiated a R500 million restructuring grant
with the National Treasury to support iGoli
2002 in exchange for a commitment to
timely and steadfast implementation of its
key elements. It is a key accountability
mechanism between the national and city
governments and has become an incentive
scheme to catalyze citywide restructuring
throughout the country.
Capital markets: On the strength of the
reforms, management sought a new credit
rating, aiming to win back the conﬁdence
of the city’s banking community. As the city
shifted from a large deﬁcit to a balanced
budget, capital expenditure ﬁnanced by the
markets went from R300 million to well
over R1 billion in two years.

Public sector underpinnings

For Forms of Government let fools contest;
What’er is best administer’d is best.
Alexander Pope, Essay on Man.

chapter

For basic services in education, health, and
infrastructure to work for poor people, governments have to be involved. Whether they
fulﬁll this responsibility by providing,
ﬁnancing, regulating, or monitoring services or providing information about them,
the basic functioning of government should
underpin, not undermine, effective services.
When governments do not run well, they
cannot sustain the institutional arrangements
and accountability relationships that yield
good services. Looking at all that governments do, the biggest payoffs to service delivery are likely to come from a few key actions:
spending wisely and predictably in line with
priorities and coordinated across sectors;
managing decentralization to reap the beneﬁts of being closer to the client; developing
and deploying administrative capacity to take
sound decisions at the top and to implement
them well; curtailing corruption; and learning from success and failure.
Public sector reforms take time and
skillful political navigation. Agreeing on
desirable goals is easy. Managing the transition is hard. When starting capacities are
low, the road to improved performance

may need to be covered in small steps—
what this Report calls strategic incrementalism. Reforming basic incentives that
strengthen accountability and raise performance closer to formal standards is the
place to start. As incentives become better
aligned and internalized and as administrative capacity grows, more advanced
reforms can be deployed to support
deeper institutional change and scaling
up. Throughout this process reforms
should be guided by the lessons of success
and failure.

Strengthening the foundations
of government
Governments are essential to making basic
services work for poor people, but a government village school does not ensure that
children learn, or a maternity clinic that
mothers can give birth safely. Both need
timely budget transfers, reliable electricity, a
connecting road, probity in procurement,
and competent public servants. To sustain
services that work, broader structures at the
foundation of government must also work.
Whether providing, ﬁnancing, regulating,
or monitoring services, governments focused
on outcomes for poor people must
strengthen the compact relationship between
policymakers and providers along the long
route of accountability.486 For basic services
in education, health, and infrastructure, policymakers must deal with multiple compact
relationships with providers across sectors,
space, and time (ﬁgure 10.1). Just as an
ensemble makes great music when it is well
coordinated and not because it has a few virtuoso musicians, strengthening the long
route is easier when the general business of
government runs well across the entire gamut
of government activities, and not just in a few

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

sectors or agencies. The more sound the basic
functioning of government, the stronger the
foundations for service reforms.
In managing the cross-cutting activities
of governments, the three institutional
structures likely to inﬂuence service delivery the most are budgets, decentralization,
and public administration. These are crucial tasks for a government that wants to
make services work for people: making
budget allocations and implementing them;
organizing and monitoring the tiers of government that provide, ﬁnance, regulate, or
monitor services; and managing public
employees involved in service delivery.

Spending wisely
When services fail poor people, a good place
to start looking for the underlying problem
is almost always how the government spends
money. If politicians and policymakers
spend more than they can sustain, services
deteriorate. If budgets are misallocated, basic
services remain underfunded and frontline
providers are handicapped. And if funds are
misappropriated, service quality, quantity,
and access suffer. The budget is the critical
link on the long route of accountability connecting citizens to providers through politicians and policymakers.
Public expenditure management—formulating, implementing, and reporting
annual budgets—is a challenging task, particularly when capacities are limited and the
long route of accountability is weak. Chapter 5 discusses how citizen budget initiatives
can increase voice. This chapter discusses
how politicians and policymakers can
strengthen the compact using public expenditure management to systematically
achieve three desirable outcomes that can
underpin effective services: aggregate ﬁscal
discipline, allocative efﬁciency and equity,
and operational impact.487

Aggregate ﬁscal discipline
With no effective mechanism for resolving
the competing budget claims of politicians,
line ministries, and subnational governments, public expenditures will exceed
available funds. The resulting unsustainable
ﬁscal deﬁcits can translate into high inﬂa-

tion, high interest rates, and burgeoning
current account deﬁcits. Despite the simple
logic of this argument—and sometimes
driven by external shocks—countries slip
into macroeconomic crises that inevitably
lead to belt-tightening. Countries in crisis
may have no option but to curtail basic services, even if the service delivery chain normally works well. Argentina is just the most
recent example (box 10.1).
Countries can instill ﬁscal discipline by
strengthening budget formulation by the
ﬁnance ministry. Constitutional or legislative restraints can rein in legislatures and
ministries. Brazil and Chile have laws on ﬁscal responsibility that limit budget deﬁcits.
In Colombia, Peru, the Philippines, and
Uruguay the constitution constrains or prohibits amendments to increase budgets.
Sound public expenditure management
requires reliable revenue projections and
comprehensive budgets that do not hide
guarantees and other contingent liabilities.
When budgets are not comprehensive, the
consequences can be harsh, as Thailand
found in 1997 when contingent liabilities
from the banking and ﬁnance sectors blindsided the government and triggered a
regionwide ﬁnancial crisis.

Allocative efﬁciency and equity
For basic services in education, health, and
infrastructure to work for poor people, governments have to be involved, as chapter 2
BOX 10.1

The impact of Argentina’s crisis on health and
education services

After three years of recession, the economic
and ﬁnancial crisis in Argentina came to a
head at the end of 2001.The social impact of
the crisis has been devastating. Poverty rates
have jumped 40 percent.There is growing
evidence of deterioration in service quality,
access, and use of social services. Roughly 12
percent of people with formal health insurance discontinued or reduced their coverage, increasing the burden on already
strapped public hospitals, the traditional
provider for the uninsured. Difﬁculties with
federal transfers have led to serious shortages in medical supplies throughout the
public hospital network.The pressure for
maintaining funding for high-cost curative

care has further cut into the already low
resources allocated to primary care. Maternal and child health is likely to be at risk. Epidemiological surveillance data report an
increase in some endemic diseases.
Education has been similarly hit, with
salary delays and work stoppages in several
provinces. During 2002 roughly a third of
provinces experienced school closings of
20–80 days over a school year of 180 days.
Many provinces were forced to concentrate
their falling resources on wages, sharply
reducing ﬁnancing for school lunches, infrastructure, and other investments.

Ambiguous, hard-to-monitor situations in which government failure
may swamp market failure and so public ﬁnancing for efﬁciency or
equity reasons may not work for poor people (government primary
teachers fail to show up for work, public clinical care goes only to
the non-poor). Public expenditures should be directed to increasing
client power through demand-side subsidies, co-payments, client
monitoring, provider peer monitoring, and information; strengthening
voice (through decentralization, delivery arrangements that yield
more information, participatory budget analysis); and supporting
altruistic providers. Market and community-led delivery should be
used to strengthen public institutions over time.

Market failures keep services from beneﬁting poor people. Depending
on the nature of the market failure, public actions could range from
public provision or ﬁnancing (subsidies) to regulation or information
disclosure that does not crowd out private responses or that at least
takes them into account.

makes clear. This requires sound budgeting.
Good, results-oriented budget allocations
are both an outcome of the long route of
accountability and a source of its strength,
particularly for the link between policymakers and providers. How should governments allocate budgets to improve education and health outcomes? First, the
efﬁciency rationale for government intervention: are there market failures due to
public goods or externalities? Or is redistribution for equity the goal? Second, given
the rationale, what is the appropriate
instrument—public provision or ﬁnancing,
or regulation, or educating the public?
Third, what are the ﬁscal costs over time,
and how do their expected beneﬁts compare with those for expenditures on other
things that government should ﬁnance? In
considering these issues, politicians and
policymakers need to pay particular attention to what is known about the multisectoral determinants of health and education
outcomes in their country (see crate 1.1).
Reducing infant mortality may have as
much to do with how the water ministry
(clean water) or the education ministry
(female literacy) gets and uses its budget as
with how the health ministry does.
There are many pitfalls in considering
the rationale and instruments for government interventions. Focusing on market
failures alone (information asymmetry,
missing insurance markets) presumes that
government implementation failures are
inconsequential. Where this is actually
true, public provision or ﬁnancing is

appropriate (table 10.1). But where government failures outweigh market failures,
ignoring them can lead to large public
expenditures that beneﬁt only the nonpoor or to services so defective that their
opportunity costs outweigh their beneﬁts
for most poor people. In difﬁcult-to-monitor clinical care, if primary rural health
clinics lack professional staff and medicines
and the political environment is not propoor, public provision or even subsidies for
private provision may not work for poor
people. Better alternatives might be funding demand-side health subsidies or district hospitals where monitoring is easier
and peer pressure for doctors can work.
Where monitoring is easy, as in immunization campaigns, contracting for private
provision may be a good solution.
Similarly, ignoring the likely private
response to public interventions (such as
the crowding out of private providers or
household income effects of government
subsidies) can lead to ineffective public
expenditures. Equity-seeking public expenditures can end up helping the non-poor if
analysis suggesting that services or money
never reach poor people is ignored in policy
design.
These questions about rationale and
instruments cannot be answered without
detailed information about the sector, the
service, the nature and depth of market and
government failures, who beneﬁts (expenditure incidence), and private responses to
public interventions. This information
needs to be developed through in-depth

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

21_WDR_Ch10.qxd 8/14/03 10:15 AM Page 183

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

analytical work (in itself a public good that
governments and their external partners
should fund). Determining true costs and
impacts for allocation decisions is not easy,
particularly when self-serving line agencies
have strong incentives to manipulate or
withhold information from the ministry of
ﬁnance. This information asymmetry can
lead to perverse practices (such as line ministries back-loading costs to later years) that
reduce the transparency of the budget and
its alignment with overall priorities and the
practicalities of what works.
In recent years several countries have
approached these problems of transparency
and results orientation in budget formulation through medium-term expenditure
frameworks. These multiyear frameworks
make tradeoffs more transparent across sectors and time and synchronize mediumterm priority setting with the annual budget cycle. They offer the promise of better
budget management, though early implementation suggests that realizing these
gains takes quite a bit of time, effort, and
parallel improvements in budget execution
and reporting.488
Properly implemented, a medium-term
expenditure framework can reduce incentives for bureaucratic gaming and reveal
the true costs of the political choices being
made in the budget. It can usefully address
the information asymmetry between the
ministry of ﬁnance and line agencies,
because its forward-estimate system
requires line ministries to cost their programs over the medium term—essentially
a rolling three- or four-year budget. A
properly functioning forward-estimate
system can induce line agencies to set
aside funding for recurrent costs and
improve the delivery of services suffering
from inadequate maintenance, such as
primary schools.
As the capacity to manage grows, a
medium-term expenditure framework can
offer other advantages. Sector-speciﬁc
expenditure frameworks can be developed
and linked to the overall framework,
increasing conﬁdence that the budget is
becoming more results-oriented (chapter 8
discusses this approach to health budgeting
in Mali). With a multiyear framework poli-

cymakers can focus on new programs, since
allocations for existing programs, decided
in previous years, would only need updating. Finance ministries can more transparently require line ministries to propose cuts
in ongoing activities to pay for new programs. Line ministries would have an
incentive to know the least effective programs at any point in time, creating
demand for systematic monitoring and
impact assessment capacity and for client
feedback.
For all their advantages however,
medium-term expenditure frameworks are
not a magic bullet. Aggregate and sectoral
outcomes and capacity development reveal
a mixed picture. Some applications are
maturing slowly (in Albania, South Africa,
Uganda), some are still coming together
(Rwanda, Tanzania), and some are struggling (Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
Ghana, Malawi).489 In Malawi’s development budget for 1996–97, health was allocated at 21 percent of the total but it
received only 4 percent.490 Implementing
medium-term expenditure frameworks is
difﬁcult, perhaps taking a dozen years or
more, as the experience of early adopters
such as Uganda demonstrates. A solid foundation of budget execution and reporting
seems key, but is also difﬁcult to achieve.
Implementing a medium-term expenditure
framework can help build the basics, as can
participatory budgeting initiatives discussed in chapter 5. Other success factors
include carefully matching implementation
to capacity, keeping budget projections and
estimates realistic, distinguishing between
collective ministerial responsibility in the
cabinet and the interests of individual ministries, and engaging line ministries in the
strategic phase prior to considering detailed
estimates, when the rationale and instruments for public intervention can be carefully thought through.

Operational impact
Ultimately, even the best budget allocations
are only as good as their impact on desired
outcomes for poor people. After controlling
for national income, comparative studies
show that public spending per capita and
outcomes are only weakly associated

(chapter 2). Similar changes in spending are
associated with different changes in outcomes, and different changes in spending
are associated with similar changes in outcomes. This is not to suggest that public
funding cannot be successful—countries
like Thailand have sharply reduced infant
mortality rates through commitment, good
policies, and spending. But it does mean
that unless public expenditures are resultsoriented they will be ineffective. There has
been a major push in recent years to make
policymakers and providers accountable
not only for how they spend money but also
for what they achieve—for intermediate
outputs and ﬁnal outcomes. Countries are
using several instruments: single-sector and
multisector program approaches, alignment of overall national strategies with
budgets, tools for verifying where the
money goes, and stronger oversight controls to reduce fraud and misuse of public
funds.
Programmatic approaches. Individual investment projects can fall short of their
objectives if they ignore linkages or tradeoffs over time and space or with other sectors. Chapter 11 discusses sectorwide
approaches as a way of enhancing development impact, building stronger donor partnerships, improving the management of
sector resources, and scaling up successes.
Used in countries as diverse as Bangladesh,
Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Zambia, sectorwide approaches
show that over time strategies and objectives are better articulated, and management information, monitoring, evaluation,
and resource planning systems better established, in sectors that use such approaches
than in those that do not.
Poverty reduction strategies. A country’s
poverty reduction strategy can link public
expenditures explicitly to service delivery
for the poor, build country ownership, and
strengthen citizen voice through consultations with civil society. In 1999 low-income
countries began preparing Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) as the basis for
concessional lending from the World Bank

and the International Monetary Fund and
for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative.491 Many countries and donors have
stressed better public expenditure management as a means of tracking pro-poor
spending and increasing donor and recipient accountability for external assistance. A
recent review of the pro-poor expenditure
tracking capacities of budget management
systems among HIPCs suggests that they
have far to go.492 While recognizing that
improvements in public expenditure management will take time,493 both domestic
stakeholders and donors have highlighted
the need for developing and implementing
detailed plans for improvement.
Ideally, poverty strategies should be fully
integrated into the budget, but this is still a
new approach and success has varied. For
some countries integration has been a primary goal (Albania). Tanzania and Uganda
have integrated poverty strategies with their
medium-term expenditure frameworks,
adding focus, legitimacy, and stability to
both. But other countries have assigned
responsibility for preparing their poverty
strategy to a ministry not directly concerned with public expenditure planning.
In Ghana, it was initially assigned to the
planning ministry, though more recently
the planning portfolio has been folded into
the ﬁnance minister’s portfolio.
Public expenditure tracking surveys. In
judging operational impact—the quality
and quantity of service delivery, and where,
how, and to what effect allocated funds are
spent—public expenditure tracking surveys can follow the ﬂow of funds through
tiers of government to determine whether
the funds actually reach the schools or clinics they are destined for. Tracking surveys
not only highlight the uses and abuses of
public funds, but also give insights into
capture, cost efﬁciency, decentralization,
and accountability.494 Even when little
ﬁnancial information is available, tracking
surveys can show what money is supposed
to reach a community and how much actually does. Made public, this information
can strengthen voice and client power relationships (box 10.2).

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

Financial management. Auditing helps a
government hold itself accountable for the
way policymakers and providers spend
money. Audits have traditionally focused on
basic ﬁnancial controls and cash ﬂows. This
focus reﬂects the control culture in public
ﬁnance and the long-established view that
accountability for fund use supports the disciplined use of resources as intended by budgets. In recent years, however, accounting and
auditing processes have been challenged to
examine expenditure performance as well as
conformance. The new performance orientation of audits is particularly relevant to operational efﬁciency concerns in budgets and
suggests an expanded notion of accountability. Public ﬁnancial managers now need to
consider their roles as contributors to ﬁnal
outcomes as well as controllers.495
Procurement. The cost and quality of government programs are critically affected by the
procurement process through which budgets
are spent. Procurement inevitably encompasses an intricate set of rules and procedures,
each capable of retarding or promoting transparency, contestability, accountability, and efﬁciency. Leakages, primarily through fraud and
corruption, can mean substandard equipment
and infrastructure, lack of essential medical
supplies, insufﬁcient textbooks, unnecessary
low-priority goods, and poor-quality public
services. Inefﬁcient procedures create higher
costs for suppliers, which are passed through
as higher program costs. Improving procurement requires extensive analysis of its rules,
procedures, and institutional arrangements.
To support streamlining, several countries
have turned to information and communications technology. Brazil, Chile, Mexico, the
Philippines, and the Republic of Korea, among
others, have developed strong e-procurement
systems that lower costs and increase transparency, competition, and efﬁciency.496

The case of the missing money: public
expenditure tracking surveys

In the early 1990s the Ugandan government
dramatically increased spending on primary
education. But school enrollments stagnated.
Could it be that the money was not reaching
schools? To answer this question, a public
expenditure tracking survey started collecting data in 1996 on government transfers to
schools. It found that 87 percent of the nonwage resources intended for the schools was
diverted to other uses.This information was
made public and prompted a vigorous
response from the national government,
which, along with parents, put pressure on
school principals to plug the leaks (see spotlight on Uganda). Follow-up studies have
shown that the situation has improved.
Tracking surveys can ﬁnd problems in
unexpected places. A survey in Peru tracking a participatory food supplement
program (Vaso de Leche, or “Glass of Milk”)
revealed that less than a third of each dollar
transferred from the central government
reached intended beneﬁciaries. Most of the
leakage occurred below the municipal
level—in the Mothers Committees and
households.The results challenged the
belief underlying the program that local
community organizations were always
more accountable than public agencies.
Authorities have decided to merge all nutri-

tion programs into a social fund that will
transform Vaso de Leche into a conditional,
multipurpose, cash-transfer program with
stronger accountability.
These and other tracking surveys in
Chad, Ghana, Honduras, Mozambique,
Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia suggest several lessons.
They conﬁrm that budget execution is a
major problem and show that procedural
clarity and due process are often missing.
They ﬁnd that poor resource management
is often a result of too much discretion in
resource allocation when there is limited
information, weak controls, and strong
vested interests.Tracking surveys reveal
insights into the actual (rather than the formal) operation of schools and health clinics
and allow comparisons of public, private,
and nongovernmental providers.Tracking
surveys are highly cost-effective if the leaks
they detect are plugged. But they need an
authorizing environment: unless there is a
solid political commitment for more transparency, government agencies may be
reluctant to open their books.The challenge
is to institutionalize tracking surveys within
a country’s own ﬁnancial control regime.

tries, China and India, have embraced decentralization. China’s phenomenal industrial
growth took place within an institutional
framework of decentralization, and India’s
constitution was amended in 1992 to promote local government.497 But the extent of
decentralization varies considerably and is
probably less than generally imagined: even
in developed countries the average subnational share of expenditures was just above 30
percent in recent years (ﬁgure 10.2).
Subnational authorities can be efﬁcient
providers and regulators of local services
under the right institutional incentives and
with clarity about who does what—and with
what.498 But greater autonomy can also
increase opportunistic behavior and create
moral hazard, resulting in costs that diminish
accountability and the beneﬁts of decentralization.499 Good design, sound management,
and constant adaptation by both central and
subnational authorities are needed to make
decentralization work.

Decentralization and service delivery
Decentralization is not magic. Allocating
more responsibilities to subnational governments does not itself transform service
delivery. This depends on whether decentralization is motivated by political, ﬁscal,
or service reform objectives.
Decentralization is often primarily a
political act aimed at greater regional
autonomy. Decentralization of services is a
by-product (box 10.3). Indonesia decentralized responsibility for many services in
1999–2000, including schooling, as part of a
larger move to greater regional autonomy.
In such cases decentralization is a fact of life
educators must cope with—not a deliberate
educational reform. New arrangements can
always create opportunities for reform,
however. Using those opportunities effectively depends on two conditions. First,
there must be relevant information about
performance across jurisdictions so that citizens can bring justiﬁed pressure to bear on
politicians and policymakers if their area is
lagging. Second, there must be an environment in which local jurisdictions can experiment and evaluate new approaches.
Decentralization may also be driven by
ﬁscal concerns to align responsibility for
services with the level of government best
able to manage and mobilize resources for
them. One danger is that the central government uses this as an excuse to off-load
expenditure responsibilities onto jurisdictions that cannot have recourse to potentially inﬂationary ﬁnancing. While this
could lead to a greater willingness to pay
more local taxes (because citizens perceive a
direct link between taxes and service quality), there is no reason to believe that this is
automatic. Fiscally motivated decentralization is particularly worrisome where special
equalization efforts for lagging regions or
safety nets for poor families must be sustained by the center.
Decentralization can also be driven by a
desire to move services administratively
closer to the people. But success depends on
how decentralization affects relationships
of accountability. If decentralization just
replaces the functions of the central ministry with a slightly lower tier of government (a province or state), but everything

21_WDR_Ch10.qxd 8/14/03 10:17 AM Page 187

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

else about service delivery remains the
same, there is little reason to expect positive
change. The assumption is that decentralization works by enhancing citizens’ voice
in a way that leads to improved services. But
on both theoretical and empirical grounds
this could go either way. The crucial question always is whether decentralization
increases accountability relative to its alternatives. If local governments are no more
vulnerable to capture than the center is,
decentralization is likely to improve both
efﬁciency and equity.500
The impact of decentralization on services is further complicated when, as is usually the case, political, ﬁscal, and administrative goals are not followed simultaneously or
in a supportive sequence. Decentralization
in eight Latin American countries suggests
that political objectives were often the trigger, but paths diverged thereafter (box 10.4).
Only some countries moved on to ﬁscal and
administrative decentralization as primary
objectives. Such variation, inevitable as
countries adapt, makes it hard to predict the
course of decentralization and to measure
its costs and beneﬁts.501 Given its many
paths, the record of service improvements is
mixed—including some notable successes
(decentralizing education in Central America, devolution in Bolivia, municipal
reforms in South Africa), some reversals (in
the Russian Federation and parts of Latin
America), and some cases too new to assess
(initiatives in Indonesia and Pakistan).502

Decentralization as a political imperative:
Ethiopia

In Ethiopia decentralization has been a
response to pressures from regional and ethnic groups for greater political participation.
When the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF) defeated the
Mengistu dictatorship in 1991, the new government faced a complex political landscape.
Ethnicity was extremely politicized, and the
struggle against Mengistu had been spearheaded by organizations promoting ethnic
nationalism in Ethiopia’s diverse population.
The single-party EPRDF government needed
to establish control over the entire country,
legitimize its authority, and include other
groups in the political system.
The 1994 constitution transformed
Ethiopia into an ethnicity-based federation
and decentralized administrative responsibilities to nine regions.The accompanying
education reforms were laid out in the “Education and Training Policy of 1994.” Regions
were given responsibility for planning,
designing, implementing, and monitoring

the primary education curriculum and
teacher training.The syllabus remained centrally controlled, with input from the
regions. Previously, Amharic had been the
sole language of instruction, but the new
policy gave all children the right to receive
primary education in their mother tongue.
At least 18 languages are now being used
as the medium of instruction, although
Amharic remains the national language.
Politically motivated decentralization
carries implications that are critical for the
impact of reform.The education policies
adopted along with political decentralization may well be good ideas for improving
the quality of instruction and learning. But if
improving quality is not a central objective
of decentralizing Ethiopian education, the
resulting lack of commitment to ensuring
that outcome could become the most difﬁcult obstacle to overcome.

Decentralization
and accountability for services
Decentralization must reach the clinic, the
classroom, and local water and electricity utilities in ways that create opportunities for
strengthening accountability between citizens, politicians/policymakers, and providers.
Depending on its degree—deconcentration,
delegation, and devolution—and its implementation, decentralization offers opportunities for strengthening different parts of the

Many roads to decentralization: Latin America

Decentralization in Latin America shows how objectives changed over time in each country and shaped
outcomes and the path of decentralization. Where
decentralization was driven mainly by political
objectives (as in Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), the
transfer of resources was often signiﬁcant, but the
transfer of responsibilities was more difﬁcult to pursue. Where political decentralization was joined and
driven by sophisticated but misaligned regional ﬁscal autonomy (as in Argentina and Brazil), cyclical
economic and political crises erupted because of the
inability of the center to impose ﬁscal discipline on
subnational governments. In Colombia, though
decentralization was initially driven by political
motives, ﬁscal and administrative adjustments ran
deeper, and cyclical adjustments in the ﬁscal and
administrative systems were common.

187

This experience in Latin America shows that the
transfer of political, ﬁscal, and administrative power
does not necessarily occur simultaneously or in a
supportive sequence. In fact, only in Bolivia’s reform
effort in 1994 were these powers transferred
together. Chile democratized in 1990, introduced
popular participation but not regional elections and
devolution, and in the mid-1990s further deepened
the administrative delegation that had marked its
earlier military regime. Of these countries Chile may
now be best placed to attempt deeper administrative and political devolution because of the growth
of local capacity and the absence of the regional ﬁscal crises that struck many of its neighbors on their
road to decentralization.

service delivery chain (ﬁgure 10.3). Deconcentration affects primarily the compact relationship between central policymakers and their
local frontline providers and may have little
inﬂuence on local voice. At the other end,
devolution implies the handing over of greater
power and resources to local politicians and
therefore greater scope for strengthening local
voice, their compact with local providers, and
local client power. Delegation falls in between.
The degree of decentralization thus impacts
differently on the short and long routes of
accountability (table 10.2). In practice, decentralization inevitably involves a mix of deconcentration, delegation, and devolution.
Particularly when local taxing and spending powers and central ﬁnancing are well
matched, decentralization can create checks
and balances that can motivate both central
and subnational governments to make local
services work. But accountability may not
improve, and the potential gains of decentralization may be lost, if the ﬁscal and other
incentives underlying the center-subnational
relationship are misaligned so that checks and
balances do not work. A study of the transfer
of responsibility for secondary schools to
provinces in Argentina in 1994–98 found that
while average test scores improved, the gains
were much lower when schools were transferred to severely mismanaged provinces (as
measured by provincial ﬁscal deﬁcits).503
To allow decentralization to reach local
classrooms, clinics, hospitals, and public
works departments in a way that increases
accountability and makes services work bet-

ter, three areas are key: subnational ﬁnance,
the division of administrative responsibilities
between center and subnational governments, and local capacity.

Getting ﬁscal incentives right
A subnational government will have weaker
incentives to deliver cost-effective services that
meet minimum standards if it can manipulate
funding (from the center or from market borrowing) to shift its liabilities to the center
(called a soft budget constraint).504 Subnational liabilities can be contractual, ﬁscal
deﬁcits, or public goods that are underprovided. A soft budget constraint weakens
accountability, creates moral hazard, and
threatens macroeconomic stability by creating
contingent liabilities for the center that it may
ﬁnd hard to refuse to pay. Underdeveloped
capital markets and elections that do not
penalize local politicians for cost and deﬁcit
shifting are part of the problem. A hard budget
constraint strengthens accountability but
requires a sound intergovernmental ﬁscal system. The center, having devolved responsibility and resources, is prodded by a hard budget
constraint to support effective subnational
management and service delivery, thereby
avoiding ﬁscal problems and unhappy citizens.
Getting the intergovernmental ﬁscal system
right. Standard welfare economics suggests
the efﬁciency and equity grounds for assigning expenditure responsibilities, revenues,
and grants to lower tiers of government.505

Key political, ﬁscal, and administrative features of decentralization and the accountability for service delivery
Degree of
decentralization

Political features

Fiscal features

Administrative features

Deconcentration
(minimal change)

• No elected local government
• Local leadership vested in local ofﬁcials,
such as a governor or mayor, but appointed
by and accountable to the center
• Voice relationships are remote and
possibly weak

• Local government is a service delivery arm
of the center and has little or no discretion
over how or where services are provided
• Funds come from the center through
individual central ministry or department
budgets
• No independent revenue sources

• Provider staff working at local level are
employees of center, and accountable to
center, usually through their ministries; weak
local capacity is compensated for by central
employees
• Accountability remains distant: the short route
of accountability may be weak if provider
monitoring is weak and citizens may have to
rely on a weak long route stretching to
politicians at the center; a strong compact
between policymakers and providers can
compensate to some extent

Delegation
(intermediate change)

• Local government may be led by locally
elected politicians, but it is still accountable,
fully or partially, to the center
• Voice relationships are more local and
proximate, but can be overruled by center

• Spending priorities are set centrally, as well
as program norms and standards; local
government has some management
authority over allocation of resources to
meet local circumstances
• Funding is provided by the center through
transfers, usually a combination of block
and conditional grants
• No independent revenue sources

• Providers could be employees of central or
local government, but pay and employment
conditions are typically set by center
• Local government has some authority over
hiring and location of staff, but less likely to
have authority over ﬁring
• Both long and short routes of accountability
potentially stronger; greater local knowledge
can allow better matching and monitoring of
supply with local preferences, strengthening
both the compact and client power

Devolution
(substantial change)

• Local government is led by locally elected
politicians expected to be accountable to
the local electorate
• Voice relationships can be very strong, but
also subject to capture by elites, social
polarization, uninformed voting, and
clientelism

• Subject to meeting nationally set minimum
standards, local government can set
spending priorities and determine how best
to meet service obligations
• Funding can come from local revenues and
revenue-sharing arrangements and transfers
from center
• A hard budget constraint is imperative for
creating incentives for accountable service
delivery

• Providers are employees of local government
• Local government has full discretion over
salary levels, stafﬁng numbers and allocation,
and authority to hire and ﬁre
• Standards and procedures for hiring and
managing staff may still be established within
an overarching civil service framework
covering local governments generally
• Potentially strongest long and short routes of
accountability, but now also more inﬂuenced
by local social norms and vulnerable to local
capacity constraints and politics

devolved to the lowest tier of government
that can internalize the costs and beneﬁts of
the service—the so-called subsidiarity principle. The principle suggests that subnational
governments should administer basic health
and education services. But setting minimum
standards (for quantity, quality, and access)
and ﬁnancing minimum access should be
central responsibilities on grounds of interjurisdictional equity. In practice, things get
more complicated. Expenditures are often
not assigned carefully to subnational governments.506 Central governments delay transfers. Shared expenditure responsibilities are
the trickiest to handle and can lead to freerider problems and deﬁcit- and cost-shifting
behavior that softens the budget constraint.
To increase responsiveness to local citizens, subnational governments need a local
tax instrument and the freedom to set rates.

Also important are simple, transparent, formula-based transfers from the center that
are predictable over several years. If made
contingent on service outputs, lump-sum
grants can ensure a minimum level of service delivery for poor people, equalize ﬁscal
capacity across jurisdictions, and create performance incentives. Ideally, expenditures,
revenue assignments, and transfers should
be designed jointly so that once they are set,
any additional expenditure demands could
be met through taxes rather than grants.507
The more these principles are violated, the
greater the informality around transfers,
and the lower their predictability and stability, the softer the budget constraint gets.508
Getting subnational borrowing right. Capital markets, where sufﬁciently developed,
can bolster subnational accountability.

Where markets are underdeveloped and market discipline is weak, a prior question is
whether subnational governments should
borrow at all. Effective ﬁscal decentralization
should certainly precede ﬁnancial decentralization to avoid giving the signal that the center is underwriting subnational debts.509
Allowing subnational borrowing from public
ﬁnancial institutions can unintentionally send
this signal. In Argentina, Brazil, India, and
Ukraine, specialized development banks and
institutions have provided a backdoor route
to central subsidies when transfers would
have been simpler and more transparent.
Getting subnational regulation right.
Governments ﬁnd it hard not to bail out
lower-tier governments when ﬁnancial
proﬂigacy threatens basic services, risks
spreading to other jurisdictions, or threatens monetary policy or the country’s credit
rating. This has led to the imposition of
top-down regulation, either administrative
controls or rule-based debt restrictions that
mimic the market. Regulation, because it is
vulnerable to political bargaining, usually
needs to be supplemented by checks and
balances on the center itself so that its
stance remains credible. In South Africa
these are provided by the constitution, the
constitutional court, and international capital markets.510 Subnational bankruptcy
arrangements can help. A control board
(that can be invoked only by an independent court) to ﬁnance minimum, nationally
set service levels can protect the center from
having to step in. Where bailouts are
unavoidable, the center can use the opportunity to make regulation more effective. A
comprehensive ﬁscal monitoring and evaluation system that works consistently across
jurisdictions can help greatly in implementing no-bailout and regulation strategies.

Getting administrative
responsibilities right
Political and ﬁscal considerations generally claim far greater attention than
administrative decentralization does.511 In
many instances decentralization has proceeded without explicit stafﬁng strategies,
and a central civil service typically coexists
with subnational and local governments.

Though the 1992 landmark amendments
to the Indian constitution require each
state to create urban and rural local governments and assign functions and revenues, virtually all staff at the local level
remain state employees. In contrast,
Indonesia recently adopted a “big-bang”
approach, moving quickly to transfer
roughly 2.1 million civil servants to subnational district governments.512 Uganda,
in shifting from deconcentration to devolution in the 1990s, established district
service commissions with the authority to
hire and ﬁre personnel—though in practice central policy and administrative
rules have tightly controlled the process so
that it has resembled delegation more
than devolution. That may change as local
capacities grow. Pakistan’s recent threetier devolution envisages the creation of
district and subdistrict cadres: district
health and education cadres have been
created in some provinces, but administrative decentralization still has a long way
to go.
National pay scales, rigid collective bargaining agreements, and disagreements with
national labor unions can severely circumscribe the ﬂexibility that subnational governments have in rationalizing employment,
as seen in many Asian, African, and Latin
American countries.513 Centralized labor
negotiations and bargaining agreements can
act as unfunded mandates that undo ﬁscal
decentralization (as in South Africa). Engaging public sector workers and unions in discussions about different aspects of decentralization can increase local ﬂexibility and
improve provider compacts. At the same
time, administrative devolution needs to
strike a balance between autonomy and uniformity to allow for desirable features such
as interjurisdictional mobility for highly
skilled staff in short supply. It is important
to align the structure of the civil service with
the assignment of service responsibilities to
different tiers—misalignment confuses
incentives, weakens accountability, and creates conﬂicts of interest instead of checks
and balances. In practice this is not easy, and
it takes time.
The twin tasks of devolving administration and building local capacity can be

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

21_WDR_Ch10.qxd 8/14/03 10:19 AM Page 191

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

daunting even under ideal conditions of
budget and stakeholder support. When
budgets are constrained and support is
mixed, public administration reform is
inevitably drawn out, falling behind political and ﬁscal decentralization. So the earlier
the start in building local capacities, the
smoother the process of decentralization is
likely to be.

Building local capacity with
autonomy
Decentralize or build local capacity: which
ﬁrst? In an ideal world subnational governments would be made fully accountable
before they were given authority and autonomy. Decentralization in the absence of adequate local capacity was once considered
undesirable,514 but that view is changing as
experience shows that local capacities
expand best as decentralized systems mature,
even though sequencing remains difﬁcult.
The challenge is to balance political, ﬁscal,
and administrative considerations even
when capacity mismatches occur. Where
local institutions already exist, even informal
ones, the challenge is to deﬁne their responsibilities and legal status and move the informal closer to the formal. Where local institutions do not exist, the challenge is to
construct the underlying legal and political
framework for new institutions.
Fostering capacity is best done in partnership between the center and subnational
governments, with the center providing
incentives for subnational governments to
match demand-driven capacity growth
with supply-side assistance and ﬁnancing
(box 10.5). In this partnership the functions
of central staff also change, from line management to policy formulation, technical
advice, and monitoring. Central staff
require incentives and training to do their
new jobs effectively.

Pulling the pieces together
Decentralization fails or succeeds in the
interplay of its ﬁscal, administrative, and
local capacity attributes. The center’s role is
crucial for all three elements and, more
broadly, for the design and implementation
of decentralization. When there is a soft

budget constraint and the relationships of
voice and client power are weak, subnational governments will have little incentive
to develop local capacity and perform well,
which will make local capture by elites
more likely. Ultimately, the center is both
regulator and facilitator of decentralization. Its challenge is to balance these roles
as it makes and manages the policy framework for the public sector and for service
delivery.

Making, managing,
and implementing good policies
When the policy decisions of politicians and
policymakers at the center of government—
senior decisionmakers and veto holders in
the executive, council of ministers, or cabinet—are uncoordinated, inconsistent, or
badly implemented, the long route of
accountability and service delivery are likely
to suffer. Breakdowns in policy management
can include a range of failures (box 10.6).
Sure signs of breakdown? When political policy decisions are not implemented, partially
implemented, or reversed.515 A study of two
African nations revealed that more than

BOX 10.5

Building local capacity: the role of the center

Devolution is difﬁcult when subnational governments lack skills and institutional capacity.The central government can provide
training in top-down ways. Or it can create
an enabling environment, using its ﬁnance
and regulatory powers to help subnational
governments deﬁne their needs (making the
process demand-driven), to deploy training
from many sources (local or national private
sector), to learn by doing as decentralization
proceeds, and to establish learning networks
among jurisdictions.This second approach is
more consistent with devolution and more
likely to produce capacity tailored to the
many cross-sector responsibilities of subnational governments. It also avoids the pitfalls
of a supply-driven approach.
The center may need to provide capacity support, through both a demand-driven
grant facility (for example, to help
subnational governments contract local
and other expertise) and a supply window
(for example, mobile teams with ﬁnancial
management, technical, and community
mobilization skills). Fiscal support through
block grants or challenge funds can work

on a competitive or matching basis to support local governments that achieve performance benchmarks (implementing a budgeting system, attaining service targets).
Monitoring and evaluation capacity can
also be facilitated by performance-based
incentive grants. Monitoring efforts should
feed into stronger public communication
and outreach efforts so that subnational
governments can beneﬁt from better client
feedback.
Successful capacity building requires a
phased strategy, starting with the stabilization of core responsibilities. Next comes a
transformation phase with restructuring
plans based on a critical examination of service responsibilities and priorities, institutional arrangements, and ﬁnancial and
human resources. Finally, a consolidation
phase seeks to internalize capacity growth
based on constant learning by doing and
adaptation.This is inevitably a drawn-out
process marked by the constant need to
balance greater autonomy and capacity.

two-thirds of cabinet decisions were never
implemented.516 In Zambia genuine support
for reforms introduced by the multiparty
democratic government in the early 1990s
never extended beyond a few cabinet ministers. As a result, special interest groups, who
had not been consulted, slowed implementation to a crawl.517 Such missteps are possible
at each stage of the policy management
process (ﬁgure 10.4).

Getting good policies in education,
health, and infrastructure
Policy management is particularly difﬁcult
in health, education, and infrastructure
because outcomes such as reduced infant
mortality have multiple determinants that
cross sectors and jurisdictions (see crate
1.1); costs come early and impacts much
later; and the spillover effects of services are

strong. Policy management in these sectors
is often an outcome of well-informed bargaining between competing domestic interests, so accounting for domestic political
concerns is important. By contrast, macroeconomic management tends to be the preserve of a few relatively insulated technocrats, with the central bank and ﬁnance
ministry as key veto players, crises having to
be dealt with expeditiously, and domestic
political concerns often not included in
decisionmaking.518
How a cabinet secretariat or presidential
staff that links politicians with policymakers plays its role can be crucial to the efﬁcacy of policy management in these sectors.
Members of these staffs, which often
include elite advisory groups that provide
high-quality policy advice, can be vital gatekeepers. They can use contestability—or the
careful evaluation of alternatives—to
sharpen policy advice. In Thailand the
National Economic and Social Development Board in the prime minister’s ofﬁce
provides independent ﬁscal analysis of
social sector initiatives and has promoted a
coordinated and participatory institutional
response to Thailand’s HIV/AIDS crisis.
Cabinet committees, consisting of subsets
of ministers, their representatives, policymakers, and sometimes outside experts, can
be particularly effective for intersectoral
coordination and implementation and for
identifying contending views and resolving
them before the formal decision process.
Research on cabinet functioning suggests
the conditions that favor high-quality policy
management in dealing with complex multi-

sectoral issues: discipline (decisions are realistic and can be implemented), transparency
(systematic procedures that cannot be
manipulated by individual members and that
emphasize collective responsibility), stability
(no ﬂip-ﬂopping), contestability (consideration of alternatives), and structured choice
(only core issues come before the cabinet).519
Of these conditions, discipline seems most
important. Practices vary. In the Netherlands
all items requiring cabinet approval are speciﬁed in the rules of business, and in Finland
almost every government decision requires
cabinet approval. In Australia the Cabinet
Expenditure Review Committee ensures collective responsibility and contestability for
spending proposals—ministers have every
incentive to test the new spending proposals
of their colleagues so as to maximize the pool
of uncommitted budget funds available for
their own proposals.
More realistic ﬁscal forecasting and discussion rules that allow sensible tradeoffs to
emerge between key service sectors may be
needed to avoid overcommitment at early
stages of the policy management process. A
cabinet ofﬁce that can negotiate feasible policy and legislative programs with line
departments, analyze policy proposals, and
coordinate without itself developing policy
(to avoid conﬂicts of interest) can thereafter
help ensure delivery on policy and budget
proposals on these commitments. In establishing budgets, a multiyear budget framework may help ensure adequate funding and
reduce budget instability if supported by
politicians and the requisite implementation
capacity. Communication, outreach, and
consultation can forestall opposition and
improve implementation plans. Finally, the
compact may need to be strengthened so
that neglect, incompetence, misapplication,
or malfeasance does not prevent executive
decisions from being implemented or cause
those that are implemented to be ﬂawed.

Making strategic choices in public
administration and management
Choosing how to implement good policies is
as important as making them. Countries
have experimented in the past two decades
with different public administration approaches to improving the performance and

accountability of public ofﬁcials and agencies. Analysis suggests that the basic drivers
of performance are merit-based recruitment
and promotion, adequate compensation,
and reasonable autonomy from political
interference.520 As a result of the different
approaches, the share of public employment
in total employment varies widely: for the
period 1997–99 it averaged 38 percent in
transition economies (16 countries), 24 percent in industrial countries (20), and 21 percent in developing countries (23).521 General
government employment in education and
health and in central and subnational government also varies considerably (ﬁgure
10.5). The differences reﬂect the different
roles of the state and public administration
in individual countries, institutions that have
historic roots and cannot be changed
overnight.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

The New Public Management philosophy has dominated the debate on public
administration reforms in recent years.
Implemented principally in Australia, New
Zealand, and the United Kingdom, it recognizes the government’s special role in service provision, ﬁnancing, or regulation, and
the resulting incentive problems. It seeks to
strengthen accountability by exchanging
management ﬂexibility for internal contracting among policymakers and between
policymakers and providers. New Public
Management also seeks to provide a more
transparent accounting system and tighter,
private sector–like ﬁnancial management
controls. In its extreme form civil servants
have no tenure, and their term in ofﬁce and
promotion depend on successful completion of contract-speciﬁed deliverables.
Experience in developing countries has
been mixed, with some improvements in
efﬁciency and uneven effects on equity.522
In the weak institutional settings of many
developing countries, New Public Management reforms may impose high transaction
costs that may outweigh efﬁciency gains.
As the experience with New Public Management suggests, often the problem in
implementing public sector reforms is not
deciding on reform objectives but on how to
get there. In Bolivia agencies were given management ﬂexibility in the early 1990s, but
there were no central controls to enforce
accountability. Public administration problems remained.523 The Bolivian experience
highlights the “catch-22”: central controls are

necessary when the policymaker-provider
relationship is weak and agencies lack competence and effective internal controls. But as
long as external controls are in place, line
agencies lack the incentive to acquire competency and establish internal controls.
The answer? Choosing and sequencing
public sector reforms carefully, in line with
initial capacities, to create ﬁrmer ground for
further reform. Pragmatic, incremental
reforms in weak institutional environments—
strategic incrementalism—can alleviate, if not
fully resolve, accountability problems while
creating the conditions for deeper change by
modifying incentives and building capacity to
respond to the next stage of reforms. Thailand
is considering a “hurdle” approach to reforming its centralized budget system. Line agencies would clear a series of hurdles to qualify
at each level for greater budget autonomy. In
this incremental approach to budget reform,
the dismantling of external controls has to be
synchronized with the building of internal
controls.524 Other countries can follow a more
traditional but still sequenced path of budget
reforms, differentiating between short- and
medium-term measures and building information channels for accountability as the
reforms unfold—another form of strategic
incrementalism (ﬁgure 10.6).
Formality in public sector institutions.
Many aspects of government performance
rest on an ingrained institutional discipline
or formality. Actual behavior follows written
rules, or actual budget outcomes bear a close
resemblance to the legislatively agreed budget.525 Informality emerges in weak institutional settings where incentives and procedures do not match formal rules, rewards,
and procedures.526
This formality gap is most evident in personnel and budget problems. Teacher absenteeism in many countries exposes the stark
differences between explicit rules on recruitment, promotion, pay determination, and
monitoring and the actual, informal arrangement of connections and patronage that
determine who gets hired and even whether
they have to show up at all. Lateral entry to
the civil service, intended to provide ﬂexibility and contestability, becomes a window for
patronage and nepotism when ofﬁcial posts

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

are bought and sold by politicians for private
proﬁt.527 Checks and balances on policymakers are misused when reformers who arouse
opposition are transferred capriciously.528 In
budget management as well a formal process
of policy choices disciplined by budget rules
can differ greatly from the informal process
in which the budget is made and remade constantly during execution. As noted earlier,
several African countries suffer from this formality gap in implementing their mediumterm expenditure frameworks.
What are the practical implications of
formality in public sector performance? The
experience of countries with public management reforms suggests that the presence or
absence of formality should inﬂuence the
direction of reform, even if the objectives are
the same. Where there is no strong tradition
of merit-based civil service employment, the
direction of reform has been to set up checks
and balances to legally deﬁne entry to the
civil service and the responsibilities of civil
servants, and to build a distinct and uniﬁed
corps. Security and stability of tenure and
objectivity in promotion are used to protect
against political interference. Where formality is the norm, the ambition has been to
move in the opposite direction—to reduce
the security of tenure and seniority in promotions and increase individual performance contracting, lateral entry, and rewards
for results. This experience points to an
important formality threshold in making
reform choices.
First-stage and second-stage reforms. This
threshold suggests a useful distinction
between ﬁrst-stage or basic reforms and second-stage or more advanced reforms (ﬁgure
10.7). First-stage reforms provide incentives
to achieve or strengthen formality when the
starting point is a weak institutional setting.
Second-stage reforms build on a foundation
of formality in stronger institutional environments (table 10.3 suggests illustrative
examples of such reforms). In budget management the basics include hardening the
budget constraint as a more top-down
approach to budget formulation and
strengthening implementation of inputoriented line item budgeting. Disseminating
performance information internally and to

195

citizens can give budget management a basic
performance orientation (though well short
of performance contracting). In personnel
management ﬁrst-stage reforms might
include enhancing job security to strengthen
protection from political interference.
Second-stage reforms build on a culture of
following rules and offer more choices. In
budget management second-stage reforms
include a much stronger orientation toward
results and performance auditing, building
on good budget execution capacities in government. In personnel management secondstage reforms include reducing job security,
harmonizing individual rewards with performance targets, and aligning broader terms
and conditions with those in the private sector. But a greater contract orientation is not
the only way to go. Countries such as Canada
and Germany have adopted a process of continuous adaptation of their existing systems
that relies on granting greater ﬂexibility to
achieve stronger results.

Curbing corruption
in service delivery
Many reforms to improve public sector performance and its results orientation cut
across multiple sectors. Curbing corruption
is one. Service delivery is weakened by corruption, and poor people suffer its consequences more than others do.

and social costs of corruption

private gain—is a symptom of weak relationships in the service chain. Both grand

corruption (involving politicians, senior ofﬁcials, and state capture) and petty corruption
(involving lower-level ofﬁcials, administrative procedures, and routine public services)
weaken services. The avenues for corruption
in education, health, and infrastructure are
many; they include absenteeism, patronage,
construction kickbacks, procurement fraud,
sale of lucrative ofﬁcial positions, false certiﬁcation, misuse of facilities, unwarranted
services (unjustiﬁed caesarian deliveries, private payments to government teachers for
after-school tuition), and bribes at the point
of service.529 Bribes are the most common
face of corruption for poor people, as payments to providers to evade approved procedures or to perform stated duties. Once
entrenched, corruption reduces the ability
and incentives of policymakers to monitor
providers, of citizens to monitor politicians,
and of clients to monitor providers.
Many recent studies present empirical
evidence on the costs of corruption.530 Corruption is a regressive tax, penalizing poor
people more than others.531 Poor people
often pay bribes to receive basic public services in education and health, whereas
richer households tend to pay bribes to
receive special treatment in courts, customs,
and tax authorities. Household surveys

show that the poor are the least likely to
know how to get redress when ofﬁcials
abuse their position. Transaction-intensive
discretionary services that are hard to monitor offer particularly broad scope for corruption because providers have a strong
information advantage over clients.
Corruption in its broader sense of the
capture of public resources and decisionmaking affects public spending decisions.
The loss of revenue, diversion of public
funds, and evasion of taxes associated with
such corruption mean that governments
have less to spend on education, health, and
infrastructure. Studies have found that corruption is negatively associated with the
share of public expenditures on health and
education532 and with health and education
outcomes. Politicians may prefer to spend
less on ensuring that primary health and
education services work and more on new
construction and infrastructure, which
offer greater opportunities for corruption.533 And corruption is empirically associated with lower economic growth rates.

Dealing with corruption
There has been rapid growth in diagnostic
tools to measure corruption, assess service
delivery, and make informed judgments

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

21_WDR_Ch10.qxd 8/14/03 10:22 AM Page 197

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

about entry points for reform.534 Diagnostic
surveys, already implemented in some 20
countries, usually consist of three separate but
linked instruments covering households,
ﬁrms, and public ofﬁcials. This allows triangulation of perspectives on the extent, incidence, locus, and causes of corruption.535
Public expenditure tracking surveys and
quantitative service delivery surveys of speciﬁc facilities can yield useful information on
the contours of corruption and identify entry
points for reform. Service delivery surveys can
measure staff incentives and efﬁciency, providing information on the determinants of
service quality and qualitative data on corruption. Together, they can provide a cross-check
on the causes and consequences of corruption
and provide information that strengthens the
voice relationship and client power.
Corruption in service delivery is a symptom of an underlying systemic malaise. Deal-

ing piecemeal with corruption risks treating
the symptom and not the malaise. Curtailing
corruption requires a multipronged strategy
that addresses a number of concerns—political accountability, institutional restraints, citizen voice, effective media, public disclosure
laws, competition, and good public sector
performance (ﬁgure 10.8). A multipronged
strategy is difﬁcult anywhere, but particularly
where corruption is widespread and the institutional setting is weak. Anticorruption diagnostics can shed light on the patterns and
root causes of corruption, thereby helping to
sort reform priorities and suggest suitable
entry points. In transition economies that are
building new public institutions while massively redistributing state assets, opportunities arise for both administrative corruption
and state capture.536 Where administrative
corruption is high but state capture at the
center is not, strengthening accountability

within public administration and deploying
expenditure tracking surveys and other
tools for ﬁnancial accountability might be
the place to start. But where state capture at
the center is high, political accountability
and decentralization might be the better
entry points.
An independent, well-functioning judiciary is vital for combating corruption and
often offers a viable entry point. In enforcing
laws and providing checks and balances on
the power of policymakers and providers,
courts directly strengthen voice. In many
countries, however, courts are themselves a

BOX 10.7

Managing the thorny politics of pro-poor
service delivery reforms

Reform means change and therefore opposition, often political.This is particularly the
case for reform of basic services in which
governments are involved as providers,
ﬁnanciers, or regulators, and for which the
long route of accountability therefore
comes into play.
Institutional reforms in education,
health, and infrastructure service delivery
are particularly complex. Multiple actors,
long timetables, early costs, and late beneﬁts create many known and unknown veto
players and risks. Support for expanding
access is easy to organize (new jobs, new
contracts, new patronage), but improving
quality is hard.
Reforms can be implemented more easily in pro-poor settings because of the consensus on social equity. Managing politics
then often implies curbing unsustainable
populism, promoting universal public services, and building coalitions among the
poor and the middle class so that there is
broad support for reforms.
But in clientelist settings consensus on
reforms may be difﬁcult to reach among
politicians, policymakers, and potential veto
players (government bureaucracies, business associations, labor unions, nongovernmental organizations). Vested interests and
patron-client relationships may have coopted many institutions. Reformers must
then create political room by more
purposefully managing the politics of
reform.
Though each situation is different, experience suggests some basics:

• Setting the terms of the debate, controlling
the agenda, and taking the high road,
including getting ahead of the opposition, using information disclosure and

the media to empower supporters, and
seeking strategic entry points.

• Striking sensible tradeoffs between com-

prehensive and incremental reforms,
seeking early wins for stakeholders, and
supporting reform champions and crossagency teams that can bring along others of like mind.

• Welcoming policy contestability as

inevitable, but using it to mobilize stakeholders, build coalitions, and gain electoral credibility.

• Ensuring broad, sustainable support as

early as possible, and avoiding a backlash
by aiming at universal services that beneﬁt all users, including the poor, rather
than special groups.

• Marginalizing opponents before, during,

and after implementation, particularly
those with veto power, and exploiting
splits in their ranks to move beyond the
static arithmetic of winners and losers.

Managing the politics of reform is often
a top-down technocratic process led by
central design teams and lacking participation, transparency, and occasionally even
legitimacy.This is usually a mistake. Without
good feedback it is difﬁcult to master
changing areas of conﬂict. Making services
work for poor people requires strengthening their voice in order to strengthen
accountability.This reduces, in a positive
way, the room for maneuver by reformers.
Inclusive decisionmaking and implementation processes are both a means and an end
in the management of the politics of propoor service reforms.

corrupt arm of government. Even if judges
are above reproach, lawyers, court clerks, and
other court ofﬁcials on the take can add to
the web of corruption. The ingredients of
reform are many—freedom of information,
greater transparency and sunshine laws, selfregulation through reform-minded bar associations and law societies, updating of antiquated laws and court procedures, and the
independence, competence, and integrity of
judicial personnel—but they are complicated to assemble and need time to take root.
Experience suggests that important progress
can be made if reforms focus on incentives,
institutional relationships, and information
access rather than only on formal court
rules, procedures, and court expansion. Anticorruption legislation that matches the
enforcement capacity of the country, independent supreme audit organizations, and
legislative oversight can help.

Managing transitions:
overcoming reform hurdles
Public sector reforms can arouse stiff opposition from groups that beneﬁt from existing
relationships. How can this opposition be
softened? And how to explain the dilemma of
“considerable reform in political landscapes
seeded with the potential for failure”—
exempliﬁed, for example, by contentious
education reforms in Latin America.537 There
is no easy answer, but a major factor is how
politicians and policymakers manage the
numerous transitions in public sector and
service delivery reforms, engaging with citizens and frontline providers to promote
change. Experience suggests that dealing with
the political economy of such transitions may
be the hardest task for reformers. While each
country’s experience is unique, some general
principles provide a starting point (box 10.7).
But knowing what to push and what to hold
back is an art not easy to learn or teach.
Policy managers must choose appropriately between ﬁrst- and second-stage
reforms. Even reforms such as implementing the budget require considerable leadership, capacity, and coordination across
many parts of government. Choosing second-stage reforms in a weak institutional
setting can be doubly difﬁcult. Not only is

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

21_WDR_Ch10.qxd 8/14/03 10:23 AM Page 199

Public sector underpinnings of service reform

there likely to be signiﬁcant opposition (second-stage reforms represent a greater departure from the status quo than ﬁrst-stage
reforms) but supporters may favor the
reforms for the wrong reasons (anticipating
the possibility of private gain when complex
reforms fail in an informal institutional
environment). So a mismatch of reforms
and initial conditions can lead to the subversion of the reforms from outside and inside.
Even if reformers recognize the need to
start with ﬁrst-stage reforms, there is the
problem of reform traction.538 Embarking
on reform is less of a challenge where traction is high—reformers have considerable
leverage in society and politics, are good
communicators who have sold their vision
to the majority of the population, and the
institutions to be reformed are amenable to
change and salvageable. But in settings
where traction is low, reformers must deal
with their slippery grip on reforms, which
can make it hard to shape the implementation of even ﬁrst-stage reforms.
How then should reformers in lowtraction settings initiate and implement
reforms? The answers, clearly countryspeciﬁc, go beyond the simple principles
enunciated in box 10.7. Above all, initiating
reforms in low-traction settings is a matter
of opportunity and patience. To take advantage of opportunities as they arise, reformers need to build alliances with key stakeholders in advance. They need to encourage
diversity and experimentation and to learn
quickly and systematically from the results.
And they need to create their own opportunities; building on what traction does exist
in their settings.

Evaluating and learning
Monitoring and evaluation give meaning to
the accountability relationships between service clients, policymakers, and providers. Traditionally, governments have associated
monitoring and evaluation with individual
areas of the core public sector—the audit system, discussion of audited ﬁnancial statements by the legislature—but these have
tended to remain unconnected and myopic.
What has been missing is the feedback on
outcomes and consequences of actions at
each stage of the service delivery chain con-

necting policymakers, providers, and clients.
A results-based monitoring and evaluation
system that joins information from more traditional monitoring efforts with information
from the service delivery framework can provide guidance on the institutional reforms
needed to improve service delivery. It can be
particularly useful to embed an evaluation
regime within a poverty reduction strategy so
that it is possible to see what the strategy is
doing for services for poor people.
The technology of monitoring and evaluation is widely known and usually speciﬁc
to the service and delivery mechanism.539
What is more important to focus on are the
underlying incentives for monitoring and
evaluation, and how demand for information can be made to drive the supply. Three
issues stand out: the institutional framework for monitoring and evaluation, the
role of systematic program assessment and
its links back into policymaking, and the
importance of dissemination.
Creating a new information system that
results in greater transparency, accountability, and visibility will alter political power
equations. It can challenge conventional
wisdom on program performance, drive
new resource allocation decisions, and call
into question the leadership of those
responsible. Box 10.8 highlights the importance of understanding the institutional and
political dimensions of a results-based monitoring and evaluation system and how
demand for monitoring and evaluation
should drive the supply, rather than the
other way around. Efforts to improve statistical systems, for example, have often
focused on ﬁxing supply problems by
strengthening national statistical systems to
collect, process, and disseminate data rather
than on understanding the sources of
demand. This has led in some cases to an
oversupply of information: in Tanzania, for
example, health information systems
abound, but it is still difﬁcult to obtain accurate estimates of service delivery coverage.
Without some understanding of how
information is used, those who collect it
may see the process as time consuming and
unrewarding, leading to poor compliance
and low quality. As decentralization proceeds in many countries, it is important to

build decentralized monitoring and evaluation capacity so that central and local systems are complementary.
As emphasized elsewhere in this Report,
systematic program evaluation can be a
powerful tool for showing what works and

what does not. Given the complexity of
public sector reforms and the difﬁculty of
choosing entry points and appropriate
sequencing, governments are constantly
trying new policy and program approaches.
Some of them work well, many produce
mediocre results, and many fail. But unless
there is systematic evaluation of reforms,
there is no way to be sure that they worked
because of the policy or program or because
of other reasons.540 And unless the results
play a major part in the design of subsequent delivery mechanisms, there is no way
to be sure that governments can succeed
when they decide to scale up.
Finally, as chapter 5 and the rest of the
Report emphasize, wide dissemination of
the results of monitoring and evaluation
activities is crucial to improvements in service delivery. If not widely disseminated
inside and outside government through
mechanisms tailored to speciﬁc audiences,
the results of monitoring and evaluation
activities may not live up to their potential
for improving service delivery.

I

n the 1980s the socioeconomic indicators in Ceará, a state of about 7 million
people in northeast Brazil, were among
the worst in the country. The infant mortality rate was around 100 per 1,000 live
births. Fewer than 30 percent of municipalities had a nurse. And essential health services reached only 20–40 percent of the
population. In 1986 the state government
began a massive effort to reduce infant
deaths. It succeeded. By 2001 infant mortality was down to 25 per 1,000 live births.

to recruit, train, and deploy community
health agents. By the early 1990s health
agents were visiting 850,000 families a
month, the ﬁrst public service to regularly
reach nearly all local communities.
The monthly family visits and family
records improved oral rehydration therapy,
breastfeeding, immunization, antenatal
care, and growth monitoring—as well as
treatment of pneumonia, diarrhea, and
other diseases.
By 2001 more than 170,000 community
health agents covered 80 million Brazilians

Health outcomes, 1987–2001
Some of the decreases in infant mortality
and malnutrition can be attributed to the
increased coverage of immunization, oral
rehydration therapy, and breastfeeding (ﬁgure 2). Socioeconomic inequalities in coverage were also reduced, and the greatest
improvements were made among the poorest of the population.541 Output measures—such as immunization, oral rehydration therapy, breastfeeding, and child
weighing—have also improved.
Anecdotal evidence points to impacts in
other states. Implementing the Family
Health Program in the town of Camaragibe
brought infant mortality down from 65 per
1,000 live births in 1993 to 17 at the end of

health agents were gradually expanded to
include a doctor, a nurse, a nurse’s aid, and
ﬁve to six community health agents for
every 800 families.
This Family Health Program was based
on the success of the São Paulo, Porto Alegre, and Niterói municipalities with “family
physicians.” It added follow-up of at-risk
families and home care for chronic diseases
to the existing services. The family physicians and nurses’ aides also provide curative
care and referrals to hospitals. By 2002,
150,000 Family Health teams were reaching
45 million people.

Balancing decentralization
with a results orientation
Mobilizing actors
Using matching funds to motivate municipalities to implement new programs,
Ceará state policymakers struck a balance
between decentralizing responsibilities to
the municipalities and keeping a results
focus through state control over key
aspects of the program.
Strategies were also developed to
strengthen community leverage over
health providers and to strengthen community voice. The widely publicized selection of a large number of community
health agents from the communities
helped to “socialize” the program. Community organizations were involved in the
second round of assessments for the
Municipal Seal of Approval—a program to
give incentives to municipalities to
improve outcomes (box 1).

Financing
Several ﬁnancing mechanisms covered
annual program costs of roughly $1.50 per
beneﬁciary. In line with the 1988 constitution and 2001 health funding laws, municipalities can retain tax revenues but must
spend 25 percent on education and 10 percent on health. The salaries of community
health agents ($60 a month), and the costs
of supervision and drugs are paid directly
by the state. Municipalities are required to
cover only the salaries of nurse-supervisors
($300 a month), but many voluntarily support other costs.
The national government offers matching block grants to municipalities for education and health as an incentive to implement priority programs. The grants for
minimum basic health care amount to 10

Spotlight on Ceará

The Ceará Municipal Seal of Approval

In 1990 Brazil enacted the Statute for Children
and Adolescents, one of the world’s most
advanced laws on child rights, introducing
local rights councils and guardianship councils
to help deﬁne, implement, and monitor public
policies for children.
In 1997 Ceará introduced Municipal Seals
of Approval with support from UNICEF.The
seals were awarded to municipalities based on

reals per person per year, 2,400 reals per
health agent per year for municipalities
implementing the Community Health
Worker Program, and 28,000 to 54,000 reals
per year per team when the municipalities
implement the Family Health Program.
Monitoring and information dissemination
To encourage municipalities to participate,
Ceará state ofﬁcials tried to create a strong
“image” program. Citizens were informed of

performance indicators of child survival and
development and on administrative management of health, education, and child protection.
No monetary award is attached to the
seals, but the municipality may display the seal

schools, and other ofﬁcial services. Mayors,
showing interest in the seal, like being viewed
as “child friendly” and good managers.

its beneﬁts, and they lobbied mayors to join
the program. Implementation was phased
in, beginning with municipalities that
demonstrated interest and readiness, stimulating competition among municipalities.
Innovative social mobilization strategies expanded public awareness of the Seal
of Approval and broadened understanding
of the social indicators needed for certiﬁcation. These included compact discs to
guide radio coverage, elections of “child

mayors,” and scorecards of municipal indicators. The Seal of Approval required that
municipalities have better-than-average
health indicators for the group in which
the municipality was classiﬁed, based on
socioeconomic criteria. Color-coded maps
facilitated monitoring and recorded the
evolution of indicators.
Enforcement through hiring and ﬁring
Although the program was decentralized to
municipalities, a special team attached to
the state governor had control over the hiring and ﬁring of the community health
workers, and over a special fund created for
the program.
Many community health agents were
recruited from the community through a
high-proﬁle selection process that contributed to a sense of ownership and
empowered communities to demand better
services from the mayors. Candidates not
selected become public monitors of the performance of the community health agents.

Donors and service reform

11

chapter

Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.—I fear the Greeks
even when they bear gifts.
Laocoön on the Trojan Horse

In many developing countries, external
donors support service reform. In middleincome or large low-income countries, they
mostly pilot innovations or implement
demonstration projects. If chosen strategically and evaluated properly, these projects
can be powerful. In other low-income countries the story is quite different. Donors supply 20 percent or more of public resources
in more than 60 low-income countries. And
they supply more than 40 percent of public
resources in at least 30 poor countries—such
as Bolivia, Madagascar, Nepal, and Tanzania.
For these countries aid ﬂows are obviously
important for service delivery.
The international community has come
a long way in understanding what makes
aid more effective, focusing on the selection
of recipient countries.543 This chapter suggests that, along with country selectivity, the
way donors provide their aid matters a lot.
Donors still underestimate how difﬁcult
it is to inﬂuence reform without undercutting domestic accountabilities. Too aware of
failures in the key relationships of accountability in recipient countries, donors often
bypass them. This can produce good isolated projects, but it can also weaken the aid
recipient’s internal systems and accountability relationships (chapters 3 to 6). This
chapter suggests that:

•
•

Donors need to pay more attention to
the problems in inﬂuencing service
reform in recipient countries.
They should strengthen the critical relationships among policymakers, providers,
and clients. In circumventing those relationships, they can undermine the delivery of services.

•

•

•

Donors should support recipient institutions by evaluating innovations systematically, by harmonizing and realigning
their ﬁnancial assistance and knowledge
transfers with the recipient’s service
delivery (particularly where aid’s share
of spending is large), and by focusing on
outcomes and results.
In good country environments where
there are genuine reformers, donors
should also integrate their support in the
recipient’s development strategy, budget,
and service delivery system.
In low-income countries coming out of
conﬂict or with weak institutions, donors
should support urgent social and other
services, while identifying mechanisms
that build transparent public institutions
in the longer term. Pooling of aid will
reduce transaction costs.

This is all ﬁne, but the multiple objectives
of foreign aid create incentives for donors to
control their interventions directly rather
than to align them with the recipient’s service delivery systems. Because of these
incentives, reforming aid will not be easy. Yet
for service reform to succeed, donors have to
attach an even higher priority to aid effectiveness and development outcomes.

Aid and accountabilities
Aid differs in important ways from domestically ﬁnanced services. The beneﬁciaries
and ﬁnanciers are not just distinct—they
live in different countries, with different
political constituencies.544 This geographical and political separation—between beneﬁciaries in the recipient country and taxpayers in the donor country—breaks the
normal performance feedback loop in service delivery (ﬁgure 11.1). For example,

beneﬁciaries in a recipient country may be
able to observe the performance of aid
agencies. But they cannot reward or punish
the policymakers responsible for this performance in donor countries. The broken
feedback loop induces greater incentive
biases in aid than in domestic programs. So
aid effectiveness is determined not only by
the performance of the recipient but also by
the incentives embedded in the institutional
environment of aid agencies. Understanding these incentives is central to any reform
of aid to support service delivery better.
The divergence and distance between
constituencies and clients may be important—but there is more. Even if donor constituencies adopted client feedback as a
paramount criterion for aid, there would
still be difﬁculties in exercising external
inﬂuence without undermining local
accountability relationships. To illustrate
the inherent problem of external actors,
consider enterprise ﬁnance. When
ﬁnanciers or venture capitalists want to
inﬂuence an enterprise they are investing in,
they become an equity holder and perhaps
request a seat on the company’s board.
Clearly it would be politically infeasible for
donors to request seats in the recipient’s
cabinet. Yet the inﬂuence that donors exercise on the recipient’s public spending often
resembles that of an equity ﬁnancier.

recipient’s resources, donors affect the com-

pacts between policymakers and provider
organizations (chapter 6) in many ways. By
inﬂuencing spending patterns and budgetary processes, donors interfere directly
with the design of the compact. And by
going straight to provider organizations,
donors sidestep the policymaker as well as
the compact.
Donors affect the recipient’s spending
patterns and budgetary processes in many
ways:545

•

•

•

•

Donors may support only capital spending (construction) and expect the government to supply complementary
inputs (stafﬁng, maintenance). Governments often fail to ﬁnance the complementary inputs.
Donors may fund projects that governments are not interested in. This contradicts ownership, though it can work
where a good pilot project encourages a
new approach through its demonstration effect—or where a one-time intervention is needed.
Donors may give aid to a priority sector and
assume that government spending from its
own resources remains unchanged. This
runs into fungibility because governments
attempt to smooth spending by adjusting
their own allocations.546
Donors may set targets for the share of
spending in particular sectors as conditions for aid ﬂows. Consider the current
donor preference for social sectors, which
appears to have increased both recipients’ public spending on these sectors

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

23_WDR_Ch11.qxd 8/14/03 10:31 AM Page 205

Donors and service reform

and the social sector’s share of aid (from
14 percent of the aid ﬂows in 1991 to 34
percent in 2000).547 But strong donor
preferences can leave other important
areas underfunded or set perverse incentives in the privileged sector. In Zambia
protecting social spending led to deep
cuts in rural infrastructure spending—
possibly creating more rural poverty.548
To avoid such distortions, donors can
discuss priorities with policymakers and
work to shape public expenditure during
the annual budget cycle. But the recipient
has to have a budget process that functions
fairly well.
Many donors see a need to align aid with
the recipient’s compact between policymakers and providers. But there are other
tendencies as well. Global funds, which are
private-public partnerships at the global
level, have chosen to provide funding on a
project basis directly to service providers in
poor countries.549 The new health-related
global funds also develop policies for global
procurement and distribution of commodities, such as mosquito nets, vaccines, and
essential medicines.
In many ways, the delivery of global
funds—from a global source of ﬁnance
directly to the local provider—reﬂects the
need for donors to demonstrate that the
funds are additional to what otherwise
would have been given. But it might also
reﬂect dissatisfaction with the functioning
of the recipient’s relationships of accountability and with aid agencies. But it is not
clear that this is a sustainable solution to the
institutional problems. Evidence from
Uganda indicates that global funds can pit
the recipient’s policymakers—in charge of
the overall spending program—against its
provider organizations, who directly lobby
for off-budget funds at the international
level (box 11.1). Parallel ﬁnancing mechanisms can also undermine efforts to rationalize expenditures, reform government
systems, and increase transparency at the
country level.
Donors interact directly with provider
organizations at various levels. Some aid
agencies choose to work with line ministries. Others choose to engage providers
under local governments. And others go

205

directly to frontline providers, such as
health clinics or schools. Sectoral ministries
independently lobby donors for funding.
From the donor perspective competition
among ministries, departments, and other
organizations permits a better selection
process—because hopeful recipients will do
their best to reveal as much information as
possible to attract donors. The result: recipients’ policymakers lose control of the
expenditure program, because the ﬁnance is
off-budget and the activities bypass the
compact. Incoherent spending allocations
and uneven coverage of services ensue.
Similar competition can occur among
donors, making incentive problems worse.
When the recipient agency knows that if
one donor threatens to withdraw due to the
recipient agency’s poor performance other
donors will step in, few incentives exist for
improving its performance.550
Some donors, including the World Bank,
even circumvent provider organizations by
setting up autonomous or semi-autonomous
project implementation units for their interventions. Advocates of project implementation units recognize that the arrangements
can undermine local capacity building, create
salary distortions, and weaken the compact
between the policymaker and the provider
organization. But they argue that the better
results outweigh the costs. A study of about
100 World Bank projects in the Latin America and Caribbean Region shows otherwise:
that project implementation units have no

The debate over global funds: Uganda

It is like a hungry boy who sees ripe mangoes hanging abundantly from a tree, but
he is not allowed to pick the fruits.The Ministry of Health remains needy, while donor
money hangs around. As part of the budget
and medium-term expenditure framework,
the Ministry of Finance sets a limit to the
amount of money that can be spent on
health—as it does for all sectors—refusing
to earmark excess funds for health from
global funds.The Ministry of Finance argues
that there are a whole host of important
things that poor people need and that
there are not enough resources around to
provide all of them.
But health ofﬁcials insist that the Ministry of Finance is constructing ceilings

below ﬂoors and that it costs much more to
deliver health services than the budget allocation it receives.The Ministry of Finance
counters by saying that the country’s attractiveness to donors depends on its reputation for sound macroeconomic
management. Global funds risk undermining this by providing resources outside the
normal budget process. It is not
government’s intention to turn away additional resources, ﬁnance ofﬁcials say, but it is
important that such resources be
channeled through the regular budget
process.

signiﬁcant positive impact on project outcomes, while the likely sustainability of
results clearly suffered.551 A parallel study in
the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Region
produced similar ﬁndings.552
In Bangladesh donors responded to a crisis by setting up a separate project management unit for the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project—to speedily
address arsenic contamination in drinking
water (chapter 9). The unit bypassed the traditional water engineering departments,
deemed too inﬂexible to respond to the
emergency. Two years later it has fallen far
short of expectations. The government is
expected to close the project shortly, arguing
that the unit, having bypassed government,
was unable to deliver on the ground.
To staff project implementation units,
donors tend to hire the most highly skilled
civil servants, often at salaries many times
what they could earn from the government.553
In Kenya a World Bank agricultural project
paid eight local staff between $3,000 and
$6,000 a month, many times the $250 available to a senior economist in the civil service.554 Another study found that of 20
Kenyan government economists receiving
master’s degree training in a donor-funded
program between 1977 and 1985, 15 were
working for aid agencies or nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs)—or for their projects
by 1994. The study concluded: “elite external
master’s degrees are, in effect, passports out of
the public sector.”555 In countries with many
donors, salaries are likely to be bid up even
more, as donors compete for qualiﬁed staff.
A better choice to improve aid effectiveness is to phase these units out and to work
with the recipient’s provider organizations,
building their capacity. And it should take
place within the compact between the recipient’s policymakers and service providers.
But this requires changes in incentives in aid
agencies (see the last section of this chapter).

Donors affect management of provider organizations in recipient countries in at least
three ways: by the fragmentation of aid in a
large number of donor projects, by the choice
of activities, and by the choice of inputs.

The costs of aid fragmentation
The problem with aid fragmentation is not
that individual projects are misconceived—
it is that there are too many projects for any
to work efﬁciently. When a project’s ﬁxed
costs are high and there are returns to scale,
fragmented aid can be wasteful. Furthermore, when donors each have only a small
share of the total aid in a recipient country,
their stake in the country’s development,
including capacity building, may be
reduced relative to their concern for the
success of their own projects. Fragmentation also imposes high transactions costs on
recipients, with large amounts of ofﬁcials’
time taken up by donor requirements.
Little systematic evidence is available on
fragmentation and its effect on the management of provider organizations. One source,
though limited, is the Development Gateway database, with records on about 340,000
aid projects and programs across the developing world.556 Using the database to quantify the extent of donor fragmentation yields
a mean index value for donor fragmentation
across recipients of 0.87.557 (Index values
increase with the number of donors active in
the country and with greater parity among
donors. Low values indicate a smaller number of donors, or that some donors dominate.558) For example, Tanzania has a high
index value of 0.92, with more than 80 aid
agencies having funded 7,000 projects over
time. A similar index computed from
another data set—annual aid disbursements—suggests that donor fragmentation
is on the rise (ﬁgure 11.2).559
High fragmentation indices could reﬂect
donor specialization in different sectors, so
that fragmentation would be low in each
sector. But mean levels of the index are only
slightly lower within individual sectors: 0.85
for education, 0.77 for health, and 0.78 for
water projects. High fragmentation values
for most recipients show that donors do not
specialize very much, either by sector or by
country. Most donors are active in many
sectors, in most countries: a typical recipient
nation in 2000 received aid from about 15
bilaterals and 10 multilaterals (table 11.1).
How does donor fragmentation affect
the recipient’s provider organizations? As
mentioned, little systematic evidence is

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

23_WDR_Ch11.qxd 8/14/03 10:32 AM Page 207

Donors and service reform

available. One study ﬁnds an association
between rising fragmentation and declining bureaucratic quality in high-aid countries and in Sub-Saharan Africa, controlling for changes in per capita income and
other variables (ﬁgure 11.3).560 This ﬁnding suggests that donors with a small share
of the aid in a country may focus more on
delivering successful projects, even at the
expense of government capacity—for
example, by hiring the most qualiﬁed government administrators to run their projects. This collective action problem may be
less severe where there is a dominant
donor, who has a greater incentive to take a
broader and longer-term view of the country’s development.
High fragmentation means high transaction costs for recipients. Tanzanian government ofﬁcials have to prepare about 2,000
reports of different kinds to donors and
receive more than 1,000 donor delegations
each year. These requirements tax rather
than build provider organizations’ limited
capacities, diverting efforts toward satisfying donor obligations rather than reporting
to domestic policymakers. Recognizing the
adverse effects, donor agencies have recently
initiated measures to curb compliance costs
and streamline operational policies, procedures and practices, focusing on ﬁnancial
management, procurement, environmental
assessment, and reporting and monitoring.
High fragmentation may have an even
stronger impact in low-income countries
with weak policies and institutional environments. This is because the domestic capacity
to implement reforms is typically highly
constrained—both the political capital of
reformers and the technical capacity of the
administration. Fragmented donor interventions create pressure on existing capacity, by
demanding both political and administrative
efforts to implement change across a wide
variety of areas at the same time. Aid ﬂows
are often at low per capita levels, so a large
number of projects may also mean that the
average value of each project is small, leading
to high overhead and transaction costs.
But change has been slow. The emphasis
has so far been to ﬁnd common international standards and principles at the aid
agency level, rather than to adapt donor

behavior to the procedures used by the
recipient’s service providers in their reporting to domestic policymakers. Exceptions
are beginning to emerge, including Tanzania, Bolivia, Vietnam, and Ethiopia, where
donors are planning to help the government
develop a harmonization program rather
than limit it to the donor community.

Donor inﬂuence on choice
of activities and inputs
Donors also inﬂuence the choice of activities within a sector. They tend to be generous with training. In Malawi training
accounts for a staggering $4.5 million, or 10
percent of donor spending on health care a
year.561 It is hard to believe that the return
on this investment matches the cost or that
the government would spend this much on
training if it had the choice. And the real
cost appears to be even higher: staff may be
absent from work for long periods on training courses. Training opportunities are
often a form of incentive for staff. If so, the
funds would likely be better used if the
sponsoring donors provided them directly
to supplement salaries through the budget.
The $4.5 million spent on training health
workers in Malawi would translate on average to a 50 percent increase in salary for all
health care staff.
The input mix in aid-ﬁnanced public
spending often differs from that in recipient
spending. For example, donors provide far

more technical assistance (and project vehicles) than the recipient would buy if it had
the money. In Malawi technical assistance
accounts for 24 percent of donor spending on
health.562 A major obstacle to addressing this
issue is the shortage of data. Many recipient
budgetary systems have much better data on
the input mix for domestically ﬁnanced
expenditures than they do on donor projects,
which are sometimes treated as single lines in
the budget. Donor ofﬁcials have weak incentives to provide full information to recipient
governments. Public expenditure reviews,
often critical of government spending, let
donors off lightly. To improve scrutiny, better
data are urgently needed.

Increase client power
Client power—the relationship between
beneﬁciary and service provider—tends to
be weak in many developing countries. This
has long presented donors with a dilemma.
Should they help strengthen the links
between users and existing providers? Or
should they ﬁnd a way around the recipient’s service delivery system to ensure that
aid-funded services reach poor people? This
becomes even more complicated in heavily
HIV/AIDS-affected countries, those coming out of conﬂict, and those with weak and
corrupt public institutions. Ofﬁcial donor
agencies have followed the example of their
nongovernmental counterparts, approaching communities and user groups directly,
through sharply increased funding for
social funds and self-help projects. Three
main problems surface in these activities: an
undermining of government and other
local capacity, weakened prospects of sustainability, and the capture of beneﬁts by
elites (chapter 4).
In principle, social funds and self-help
projects could operate within the recipient’s
service delivery system. They could also
serve as entry points for the policy dialogue
with policymakers and providers and hence
build local government capacity rather than
undermine it. But like many other projects,
they tend to be operated directly by donors
with little integration.
Most assessments of social funds and selfhelp projects focus on poverty targeting.
Overall, the evidence suggests that centralized

systems do better at identifying poor communities than at identifying poor households
or poor individuals.563 The effectiveness of
targeting varies widely, which suggests the
importance of unobserved attributes of communities. Some studies show that public service delivery—measured by access to infrastructure or outcomes—improved through
community involvement,564 and others, that
performance could be better.565
Yet social funds and self-help interventions continue to face serious challenges of
sustainability. One challenge arises from the
cultural and social context of communities
and their capacity for collective action. It is
not clear that the self-help approach can
beneﬁt fractured, heterogeneous communities that have little capacity for collective
action. Alternative methods of service delivery may suit such poor communities better.
But there is little factual evidence on this
because evaluations typically do not compare social funds and self-help projects with
conventional service delivery mechanisms.
Nor do they take into account the negative
side effects. The sustainability of self-help
projects can be in jeopardy if line ministries
or local governments ignore them once they
are completed. Unless communities can
ensure continuing support for recurrent
costs and staff, they may not be able to sustain their project.
Donors need to disburse funds fast and to
show visible results quickly to supporters or
taxpayers. A recent study in a Sahelian country, also applicable elsewhere, shows that
these needs may be incompatible with
reducing poverty.566 When donors are impatient, when they compete with similar agencies for good projects, when they do not have
the capacity to monitor activities on the
ground, they may choose particular groups
to work with—risking the capture of donor
funds by elites. Impatient donors may even
make the patient donors attach greater
weight to quick results, undermining the
prospects for poverty reduction. This
becomes a serious problem when malevolent
elites capture donor funds for private gain.
But that need not be the case (box 11.2).
Social funds and self-help projects should
be designed for each context, with best-practice templates as initial guides only. Rapid

Donors and service reform

expansion of such projects by donors with
little experience may not be feasible. Rather
than implementing numerous enclave operations in a single recipient country, donors
could pool support openly and transparently
to achieve better results in scaling up and
preventing elite capture—even when bypassing the policymaker-provider relationship in
a failed state or low-income country under
stress.567 Where conditions are right, the
pooling of aid should not stop with the
donors—it should extend to national and
local governments and other providers, private for-proﬁt and not-for-proﬁt.
Donors can also promote other initiatives to enhance client power. They can
encourage citizen monitoring of service
providers, such as report cards and public
expenditure tracking surveys (chapters 5
and 10, and see spotlight on Uganda). They
can help monitor the use of services and
support beneﬁt-incidence analyses to identify the groups missing out. Keep in mind,
however, that involving providers in the
design of the monitoring process is critical
to ensuring buy-in for the results.

Promote voice
Promoting citizen voice through formal
political mechanisms or through informal
advocacy groups or public information campaigns is one of the most difﬁcult endeavors

BOX 11.2

for donors. Yet donors attempt to do it in
many ways—a testament to the importance
of voice in service reform. The attempts
include imposing conditions and setting performance criteria on aid ﬂows where voice is
weak, providing direct support to democratic governance, and actively promoting
transparency and participatory processes.
By imposing conditions donors try to
replace the weak voice of citizens in disciplining policymakers (chapter 5). Yet donor
conditions are fundamentally different from
citizen voice, which is diffuse, after-the-fact,
and a long-term process. In the 1980s structural adjustment loans extended conditions
in projects to a wide spectrum of government economic policies, processes, and public spending. There is ample evidence today
that conditions based on promises do not
work well, because they undermine ownership of the reform program.568
When policymakers are not encouraged
to develop their own positions on, say, privatization of water supply or other services,
but rely on donor conditions in taking
action, they can more easily deny responsibility for a later failure. It is not the quantity
of aid that makes the recipient’s policies
good or institutional reforms happen.
Empirical studies show that aid ﬁnance is
ineffective in inducing policy reform in a
bad policy environment.569 What works

Social Investment Fund: Jamaica

There are more questions than answers on how
self-help projects really work. Do they improve
participation and targeting? Do they build
capacity for collective action? One way to
answer these questions is to analyze how the
process works in a particular political, social, and
cultural setting.
A case study of the Jamaica Social
Investment Fund integrates quantitative and
qualitative data from ﬁve pairs of randomly
selected communities. Each pair has similar
social and economic characteristics, but only
one of the pair participated in the social fund.
The fund typically uses NGOs to mobilize communities to participate.The NGOs work closely
with local elites, such as pastors and teachers.
Project selection is not generally participatory
but is driven by this small, motivated group.
Once construction of a service facility
commences, however, the group is often able to

motivate a larger group to contribute to the
project. And once completed, the service facility
is generally viewed as belonging to the community and there seems to be wide satisfaction
with the outcome. But it also appears that the
positive social beneﬁts from a communitybased intervention may be difﬁcult to sustain in
the long term, particularly in communities beset
by deep divisions.
Quantitative data on 500 randomly chosen
households from the same ﬁve pairs of communities mirror these qualitative ﬁndings. Withincommunity “preference targeting” is poor, with
three of the ﬁve participating communities not
obtaining the project preferred by a majority. By
the end of construction, however, 80 percent of
the community members expressed satisfaction
with the outcome. More educated and
networked individuals dominate the selection
process and are more likely to have their priori-

ties met.The Social Investment Fund also
appears to have improved trust and capacity for
collective action, but the gains are greater for
more educated and networked individuals. So
the process might be characterized as “benevolent capture”: elites dominate the process but in
a way that eventually beneﬁts the community.
Both participating and nonparticipating communities show more community-based
decisionmaking, indicative of a broad-based
effort to promote participatory development.
The Jamaica Social Investment Fund shows
that self-help does not necessarily “empower
the poor” and can be either supply or demand
driven. But community involvement does seem
to make service delivery more effective by
increasing ownership and participation and by
improving the capacity for collective action.

better is choosing recipients more carefully,
based on performance (country selectivity),
and setting conditions that reward reforms
completed rather than those promised.570
Traditional conditionality does not work
well. How can donors then allocate aid so that
it provides a strong incentive for the recipient
to promote citizen voice and undertake service reform and thus increases aid effectiveness? In principle, there is broad agreement
today that, instead of conditions, the aid
compact needs to contain veriﬁable indicators that can measure performance. But, in
practice, the use of performance indicators
has not yet changed the incentives underpinning the relationship between recipients and
donors.571
Few performance indicators used today
measure outcomes; most still measure
inputs and processes. So far the link between
these operational performance indicators
and the outcome targets articulated in
poverty reduction strategies remains vague.
And there are few transparent mechanisms

BOX 11.3

Donors support democratic governance

Most bilateral donors explicitly include promoting democracy among the goals of their
aid programs.The U.S. Agency for International Development alone spends more
than $700 million a year on programs—
supporting free elections, fostering civil society organizations, and strengthening parliaments, judiciaries, and political parties.
Election assistance is the highest-proﬁle
component of democracy promotion. Particularly in postconﬂict situations, numerous
bilateral donors, international organizations—
such as the United Nations, the Organization
of American States, and the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe—and
private organizations send observer
missions and provide assistance to election
administrators. More than 80 international
groups observed the 1996 elections in
Nicaragua. Aid for promoting democracy has
increased from 0.5 percent of total ofﬁcial
development assistance in 1991 to 5 percent
in 2000.
The donor approach to democratic governance—democracy, participation, human
rights, and the rule of law—has striking similarities to the rest of aid: a heroic short-term
effort to get countries through a sudden
takeoff to democracy. Rather than try to
reproduce certain types of institutions,

donors could more actively nurture core
political processes and values, such as representation, accountability, tolerance, and
openness. Legislative aid programs have
often failed due to donors’ lack of knowledge
about the political and personal dynamics of
the institutions they are trying to reshape,
their determination to apply models that do
not ﬁt the local situation, and their focus on
technical solutions (such as new rules for
staffers or Internet access) for deeply political
problems.
To overcome some of these problems,
the Swedish International Development
Agency (SIDA) has initiated a new type of
analysis of the underlying interests and
power relationships as part of a program to
support political institutions in Burkina
Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Mali. In electoral
assistance SIDA has moved to longer-term
programs and closer donor collaboration in
South Africa and Zambia. In Cambodia it
supports a “national issues forum” to air
public debates on topics like corruption and
trafﬁcking in women and children on television and radio across the country.

(1999), Knack (2001), and SIDA.

to allow donors to signal the conditions for a
recipient to expect an increase or reduction
in aid. Initiatives to improve the measurement of results are under way, but it will take
time to establish an effective link between
the volume of aid and performance.
There is also tension between the monitoring and incentive functions of performance indicators. Donors, preoccupied with
ﬁduciary concerns, tend to keep a close watch
on the programs they support—hence the
focus on short-term process undertakings
rather than genuine outcome measures as
triggers for performance evaluation.572 But
this can lead instead to micromanagement,
exactly what the new system of performancebased conditions is intended to avoid. This
tension, if unresolved, makes aid compacts
incoherent.
Many bilateral donors go further and
support electoral participation and democracy directly and use aid to induce and
reward such reforms (box 11.3). For example, donors rewarded Ghana for holding free
elections in 1992, despite the excessive public
spending prior to the elections that resulted
in poor macroeconomic performance.
Donors also support informal mechanisms to strengthen citizen voice. One is to
promote participatory processes in the
development of poverty reduction strategies
and budgetary processes (box 11.4). But aid
agencies and recipient governments sometimes have different views on what form the
participation should take. Aid agencies seldom hold a dialogue with parliamentarians,
stressing instead the extragovernmental
aspects of participation, involving a wide
range of civil society. Members of parliament sometimes view the donor emphasis
on civil society as undermining the legitimacy of elected representatives, particularly
in emerging democracies. They also question the legitimacy of NGOs selected to
speak for “the people.”
Donors have encouraged many lowincome countries to open policy debates
and discussions when preparing poverty
reduction strategies. Governments are
working to bring the views of a wider range
of stakeholders into discussions. Madagascar, Rwanda, and Vietnam now have more
timely information, make greater use of

local languages, and use participation more
than consultation. There is also evidence
that these processes are inﬂuencing a shift
toward broader consultation on government decisions beyond the poverty reduction strategy. But major challenges remain
in regularizing greater openness in government decisionmaking.
Poverty reduction strategies seek to promote stronger citizen voice, with an effective link to public spending. But they also
seek to change the relationship between
recipients and donors by stressing the recipient’s ownership of the reform agenda.
There are often tradeoffs when one instrument is used to achieve multiple goals.
Countries preparing the early poverty
reduction policy papers (PRSP) faced many
challenges in managing the participatory
process and linking their strategy to the
budget, while adhering to tight timetables
for debt relief for which a PRSP was a condition. Experience in many countries suggests that when a government presents a
national development strategy, supported
by broad ownership and well-deﬁned sector
priorities, this contributes in no small measure to attracting broad donor support.
Moreover, it also offers a framework to better align and harmonize donor support.

BOX 11.4

• Not tying the consultations to a single

donor or ﬁnancing instrument. Individual
donors can use the process in their own
monitoring and review procedures.

•

First, evaluate interventions and aid projects for impact. More systematic evaluations of, say, an intervention’s effects on
student learning or health status are critical for scaling up in both middle- and
low-income countries. Evaluation linked
to early steps toward rebuilding state
capacity is important in situations where
donors are working through alternative
service providers due to conﬂict or state
failure.
Second, to reduce the costs of aid fragmentation and to build capacity, work
with other donors to harmonize and

domestic constituencies to use the

public comment, and lobbying.

it is reﬂected in budget plans,

For donors that want to align their aid
delivery with service delivery in recipient
countries, this Report has three important
messages.

•

Donors support transparent budget processes:
Tanzania

Since 1997 Tanzania has conducted an
annual public expenditure review, led by the
government with the participation of donors
and a wide range of civil society. A primary
objective is to review the government’s forward expenditure plans in its medium-term
expenditure framework, to discuss the program with donors, and to conﬁrm the external ﬁnancing. From its inception the initiative
also had the objective of developing a public
consultative process to engage a wide range
of domestic constituencies on the government’s performance and forward plans.The
working group overseeing the process is led
by the Ministry of Finance but includes members from donors and a range of nongovernmental bodies.
Several features of the process show
how donor accountability requirements can
be met in a way that promotes a sustainable
domestic system of accountability:

around the recipient’s own systems.
Where country systems are weak, they
need to be strengthened to meet good
practice standards, not bypassed and
substituted with ring-fenced donor systems and procedures. This is crucial for
aid effectiveness in low-income countries that receive a substantial part of
their public resources as foreign aid. But
it is also relevant in middle-income
countries in sectors where donors are
especially active, as in social protection
in Latin America and elsewhere.
Third, harmonization and realignment
are best done at the country level and by
strengthening the recipient’s existing institutions. In countries with fairly good
expenditure management and genuine
service reforms—where donors and recipients trust each other—budget support
should be considered a viable tool.
Resource pooling can also be effective in
scaling up service delivery and reducing
transaction costs in low-income countries

that are under stress—for example, due
to past or current conﬂict.573

Innovate and evaluate
Large public sector organizations—in both
donor and recipient countries—focus on
inputs and process evaluation rather than
outputs and outcomes (box 11.5). The
incentive to do this in aid agencies is even
stronger because of the broken feedback
loop between taxpayers in the donor country and beneﬁciaries in the recipient country
(ﬁgure 11.1). Outcome and impact evaluations are seldom built into aid projects. Special attention is required to counter the tendency of aid agencies to be input-oriented
and to increase the share of interventions
subject to rigorous impact evaluation. Outcome-oriented international targets, such as
the Millennium Development Goals, can
add to the incentives for aid agencies to
overcome their focus on inputs.
A major difﬁculty in assessing the
impacts of any public program is that beneﬁciaries are rarely selected randomly.
Indeed, most programs are purposely targeted to speciﬁc groups or regions. Isolating
the impacts from the circumstances that led
to participation is then tortuous. Yet not

BOX 11.5

Why aid agencies focus on inputs

The disruption in the feedback loop
between donor country taxpayers and
recipient beneﬁciaries, combined with the
complexity of measuring performance,
results in a focus on inputs in aid agencies.
Budgets, contracts, and expenditures on
projects are easier to monitor and assign
than are the outputs and impacts that the
aid projects produce.
Elected policymakers in donor countries
impose administrative procedures on aid
agencies to restrict their discretionary decisionmaking. In addition, bureaucracies tend
to develop their own procedures, which
increases the complexity. In this sense aid
agencies are like any other large public organization. Extensive consultations with nongovernmental organizations diffuse the risk
of political pressure in donor countries—and
complex tender and contract procedures
defuse criticism by aid service suppliers.With
such an incentive structure, aid agencies allocate comparatively few resources to verify

the results of aid projects or to mainstream
rigorous impact evaluation.The input bias
and the need to handle political problems or
pressures tilt stafﬁng toward generalists and
administrators.
Yet most aid projects include a formal
evaluation requirement. Process
evaluations—such as audits, monitoring,
and veriﬁcations that the intended action
took place—are often conducted well. Outcome evaluations are seldom built in, and if
done at all are contracted later to
consultants. If evaluations are a small part of
these consultants’ foreign aid market, they
also tend toward input bias and may avoid
revealing results that can affect their main
market. Consultants may not consciously
misreport; the market pressure is usually
more subtle. Contractors who work mainly
for aid agencies often become generalists
themselves.

doing so may produce misleading results.
Schemes that select participants randomly
provide the best opportunities for unbiased
impact evaluation. An example is the Education, Health, and Nutrition Program of
Mexico (Progresa), a large government
transfer program (see spotlight). Strong
evidence of its high impact led to an expansion of the program in Mexico and the
adoption of similar programs elsewhere.
Another example is the secondary school
voucher program in Colombia, which
assigned beneﬁciaries by lottery, making it
feasible to compare those receiving vouchers with those who did not.574 A randomly
assigned pilot program for treating intestinal worms in Kenyan schoolchildren has
been similarly evaluated.575
In many operational settings, however,
randomization cannot be applied, and
other methods must be found to create a
matched comparison. Even when data on
beneﬁciaries before and after implementation exist, determining the real effects of a
program or policy change requires data on
matched comparison groups to get at the
counterfactual of what would have happened without the policy. For some
schemes that do not have baseline data, it is
possible to construct an adequate control
group from the postintervention data. But
baseline data are needed for others, such as
rural roads with far-reaching impacts on
poverty, health, and education outcomes.576
Not every program can be evaluated for
impact, so governments and donors should
select programs for evaluation carefully,
focusing on areas where new knowledge is
needed. Interventions rolled out in phases
because of budget and other constraints
offer good opportunities for effective
impact evaluation. Similarly, when a pilot is
required before a large-scale rollout, an
impact evaluation will generate important
information for decisionmakers.

Harmonizing donor support
around recipient systems
Harmonizing is easier where the recipient
has a well-functioning national development strategy and budget process that can
serve as the common framework. But these
are not prerequisites—for even in their

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

23_WDR_Ch11.qxd 8/14/03 10:35 AM Page 213

Donors and service reform

absence harmonization and pooling of aid
can offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts and reduce
transaction costs.577 In low-income countries coming out of conﬂict or in situations
of very weak public institutions, a “budget
within the budget”—with separate accountability mechanisms for donors—or an independent service agency funded by donors,
or a consortium of nongovernmental
providers chosen jointly through a transparent process can be relevant options.578 Both
arrangements can be linked to public sector
reform efforts, which emerge over time. But
to be effective, harmonization requires a
radical realignment of procedures and operational policies in donor agencies, as the
health project in Bolivia shows (box 11.6).
For donor-ﬁnanced services shifting
responsibility—and hence accountability—
toward the recipient would reduce duplication, waste, and transaction costs. It would
also keep donors from crowding into a few
fashionable sectors—and thus lessen concerns about absorptive capacity. And it
would build capacity, improve collective
learning, and create stronger incentives for
monitoring and evaluating impacts and
results.
A common refrain is that recipients need
to improve their ﬁnancial management and
public procurement practices before donors
can align their support around the recipient’s systems. But reality is more nuanced.
First, donors need to ask whether relying on
country systems is riskier than the alternative of ring-fencing. Currently, developingcountry borrowers must produce 8,000
audit reports every year for multilateral
development banks—5,500 of such reports
for the World Bank. Such a fragmentation of
activities cannot increase accountability.
Second, even if it is riskier, this needs to be
set against the more sustainable beneﬁts of
helping to build the recipient’s institutions
and systems. Third, donors need to avoid
the trap of making a given level of capacity a
condition for aligning or pooling aid, when
in many cases the pooling launches efforts
that can get capacity closer to where it needs
to be. That said, there will still be cases in
which donors judge (rather than scientiﬁcally determine) that it would be inappropriate to pool, given the ﬁduciary risks.

213

Sectorwide approaches
Since the mid-1990s many countries have
worked to integrate government and donor
activities within a sector. In the ideal
approach, outlined in early documents on
sectorwide approaches, the government
and its partners would agree on a predictable resource envelope and on a policy
environment consistent with the national
budget and economic strategy.579 They
would then agree on how to assign
resources within this envelope. Procedures
for disbursement would be harmonized,
and funds would be pooled. All activities
would reﬂect a shared view of the priorities
and costs of activities. Differences would be
resolved by compromises in the design of
programs, not in the activities undertaken.
There would be no detectable difference
between the approach taken on government-funded and that taken on donorfunded activities; indeed, that distinction
would wither away.
Sectorwide approaches have been established in several sectors in many lowincome countries—health, education, agriculture, transport, energy, and water.580
Efforts so far are only partial realizations
of the ideal. To some extent determining
what constitutes a sectorwide approach is
still an arbitrary decision. There has been
progress toward pooling funds in recent

BOX 11.6

A case for harmonization in Bolivia

In Bolivia three donors in the health sector
agreed to coﬁnance construction of a building. But the fact that each donor had its own
procurement procedures made it difﬁcult to
ﬁnd a common approach.The donors could
not pool their contribution in a common
fund because the agencies’ rules prohibited
channeling money to another agency. None
of the agencies could accept the procedures
of the others, and two of the agencies were
unwilling to adopt Bolivian rules.
A thematic approach was considered
ﬁrst. One donor would pay for the design,
another the construction works, and the
third would contribute paint, air conditioning, electrical apparatus, and lavatories.
Then, for practical and administrative reasons and to avoid blaming the other agencies if something went wrong, it was
suggested that each donor would pay for

particular ﬂoors, procuring the materials
and hiring builders according to its own
standards and procedures.The idea was
that one donor agency would ﬁnish the ﬁrst
two ﬂoors, after which the second would
build the third ﬂoor, and the third would ﬁnish the building.
After long debates, one of the donors
withdrew from the project. Of the remaining two, the one contributing the smaller
amount accepted the rules of the donor
putting up the bulk of the funds. Only one
contractor would be hired, not the three
previously envisaged, and just one engineer
would supervise construction. One agency
would oversee the entire process.The
process took two years, and the foundation
stone has yet to be laid.

years, however. For the 24 programs tracked
by the Strategic Partnership with Africa in
2002, 41 percent of assistance came through
projects (down from 56 percent two years
earlier), 13 percent through NGOs, 11 percent as common basket, and 35 percent as
budget support. In Ghana’s health program
the pooling arrangements started with “one
donor and minimal funding” but later
reached 40 percent of program resources.581
Preparing and implementing sectorwide
approaches can be a long, drawn-out
process. It can also weaken rather than
strengthen the recipient’s compact between
its policymakers and provider organizations
by taking the sector out of the domestic
decisionmaking process, particularly the
budgetary process, ﬁnancial management
and public procurement.582 Four lessons
have emerged from sectorwide approaches:

•

•

•

•

An institutional analysis of the sector is
recommended beforehand, including
the sector’s relation to the rest of the
public sector.
If the capacity constraint is in the lead
ministry rather than the country, new
personnel can sometimes be found
quickly, as in the Ugandan education
and health sectors.583
Procedures need to be designed with
capacity limitations in mind, particularly at decentralized levels. This will
often involve encouraging public transparency and bottom-up monitoring to
bolster simple but rigorously enforced
upward-reporting requirements. Procurement procedures—often a major
difﬁculty—need to balance rigor with
simplicity.
Capacity constraints are not a reason to
delay a sectorwide approach. Few countries achieve the ideal, but most can beneﬁt from some aspects of the process.

Assessments of sectorwide approaches
have reached mixed ﬁndings. Ratings by the
Strategic Partnership with Africa in 2002
show an average implementation rating for
programs of between 0.42 and 0.58, depending on the sector (on a scale where 0 is poor,
0.33 fair, 0.66 good, and 1 very good). But it
is possible that these relatively poor ratings

also reﬂect the ambitious agenda for sectorwide approaches. A tentative conclusion is
that sectorwide approaches are an important
part of a poverty reduction strategy, not an
alternative, and the full beneﬁts will not be
realized until ﬁnancing mechanisms become
more ﬂexible.

Budget support
The focus on budget support was sharpened by the debt relief for heavily indebted
poor countries, allocating relief to priority
sectors through the recipient’s budget. Budget support restores the compact between
policymakers and providers. It allows contestability in public spending. And it
reduces the costs from fragmentation and
separate project implementation units. Providing funds to the general budget also
offers a better framework for discussing
intersectoral allocations. Advocates of more
funding to one sector have to show that the
sector has higher returns than others at the
margin.584 If funds go to sectors that
demonstrably reduce poverty—directly or
indirectly—donors should be ﬂexible about
budget allocations.
Budget support, like basket funding for a
sectorwide approach, raises questions of
ﬁduciary risk. But there is no clear evidence
that the risk is greater for budget support
than for project aid.585 Needed are transparent systems for procurement and public
information to ensure that the movement
of funds through the system can be publicly
observed and that charges paid for services
are clearly deﬁned. Donors can contribute
best by promoting these systems in the
recipient country. The Utstein group of
donors—the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, and Germany—has been
developing monitoring arrangements along
these lines. The European Union links part
of its budget support to performance, using
a small set of indicators (box 11.7).
What does all this suggest? That aid will
work best where it is provided ﬂexibly to
recipients with sound overall strategies and
well-designed sectoral programs. Flexible
aid can catalyze processes within governments to produce sound strategies, rational
spending programs, and effective services.

Donors and service reform

Knowledge transfers
Donor competition for new ideas can be
good for the recipient. It can also create
confusion, particularly in low-income
countries that have weak capacity. One
solution is to pool knowledge transfers
and joint analytical work at the country
level, including impact evaluations of
interventions and programs. All analytical
work supported by donors should draw
on in-country capacity, including universities, government, and the private sector
(box 11.8).

Poor institutions—post-conﬂict
and “failed” states
In poor institutional environments—as in
post-conﬂict countries or “failed” states—
donors may not be able to rely on conventional channels of service provision because
policymakers and providers lack the capacity or the intent to use resources well.586
Whatever the short-term or even mediumterm delivery vehicle, aid should contribute
in the longer term to rebuilding an effective
service delivery system and public sector.
The temptation to avoid the government is
understandable. But without some clear
and shared donor strategy for rebuilding a
responsive and effective state, the proliferation of nongovernmental and communitybased organizations—and self-help and
social fund initiatives—will lack breadth of
impact and sustainability. Civil society
organizations cannot design national policies or standards. Nor can they substitute in
the long term for the citizen-policymaker
relationship.
The options for donors range from
selectively supporting existing programs,
such as immunization programs operated
by the government or private providers, to
establishing an independent service authority with a temporary mandate to deliver or
regulate basic services.587 In between are
self-help projects and social funds. An independent service authority and a social fund
are ways to deliver services in difﬁcult circumstances, perhaps by wholesaling to a
local consortium of NGOs, religious organizations, and private ﬁrms. Such organizations require institutional autonomy to

Linking budget support to performance

The European Commission is explicitly linking
part of its budget support to performance.
The amount to be disbursed is based on
progress in social service delivery, notably
health and education, and in public expenditure management. Progress is measured by a
small number of performance indicators
agreed to by the recipient and the European
Commission. Indicators are typically drawn
from the recipient’s poverty reduction strategy. For the ﬁrst set of countries, the most frequently used indicators are:

• Planned and actual expenditures in the
social sectors.
• Differences in unit costs of key inputs
between the public sector and the market.
• Use of primary and antenatal health care
services.
• Immunization rates.
• Births assisted by medical personnel.
• Enrollment rates for boys and girls.
• Cost of primary education (private and
public).

After a joint evaluation by government
and donors, a score is calculated for each

indicator: one point if the agreed objective
is attained, half a point if there is evidence
of “considerable positive development,”
and zero if there is no progress. The budget
support provided is the maximum amount
available multiplied by the (unweighted)
average performance score (ranging from
zero to one). The approach is not mechanical but also takes into account external
factors.
The performance-based system highlights the quality of data. According to the
European Commission, the system is not an
end but a means: getting policymakers and
the public in developing countries to pay
more attention to results than to declarations of intentions and conditions set by
donors.
So far, 30 percent of the European Commission’s budget support is linked to performance indicators.This is deliberate,
motivated by the desire to introduce a new
approach gradually and to balance performance rewards and the recipient’s need for
predictable budget ﬁnance.

directly to donors. To deliver on such standards, hiring may have to be outside the
public sector. Again, donors should coordinate and pool their support to reduce waste
and duplication, ﬁnancing both recurrent
and capital expenditures.
Donors face the challenge of ﬁnding a
balance between short- to medium-term
institutional failures and the long-term creation of an effective state that can deliver on
its public responsibilities. Donors have
sought to address short-term service needs
through national and international NGOs,
social funds, United Nations agencies, or a
combination of these providers. What
needs to be given equal emphasis is the
identiﬁcation of country-speciﬁc paths for
strengthening capacity and reduction in
patronage and corruption. Nongovernmental channels for service delivery can thus
play a very important role but should be
seen as a transitional strategy to strengthen
state capacity in the long term.
Even in the weakest states donors and
domestic stakeholders would beneﬁt from

Pooling knowledge transfers

To improve access to infrastructure services for
poor people, several donors have pooled funds
to augment and disseminate knowledge on
infrastructure services.These facilities, administered by the World Bank, provide a source of
knowledge and advice that is “ﬁre-walled” from
the Bank’s lending activities. Donors in the pool
are Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the
United Nations Development Programme.
The Energy Sector Management Advisory
Program, a global technical assistance program,
focuses on energy in economic development,
with the objectives of contributing to poverty
alleviation and economic development, improving living conditions, and preserving the environment. It focuses on:

• Market-oriented energy sector reform and
restructuring

• Access to efﬁcient and affordable energy
• Environmentally sustainable energy produc-

pooling efforts for a better results. Harmonization of aid may not be feasible
through budget support, but agreement on
a common framework and implementation
arrangements for service delivery will help
avoid too heavy a burden on limited domestic capacity. Further, it is important to share
lessons and to recognize that aid may be less
effective when modalities that work in good
policy environments are transferred to
other situations. The ﬂexibility of “eight
sizes ﬁt all” includes a strong emphasis on
country context.

donors were driven solely by the motive to
reduce poverty—and if recipients were perceived to be committed to the same goal.
But the world is more complex. Incentives
in aid agencies and the political economy of
aid in donor countries work against this:

Why reforming aid is so difﬁcult

•

The unintended negative effects of donor
behavior are not a recent discovery. World
Development Report 1990: Poverty (World
Bank (1990)) discussed the role of aid in
poverty reduction, drawing attention to
many similar problems. Why has there not
been more reform? Why, for instance, are
donors so reluctant to channel aid as part of
the recipient’s budget?
Simplifying donor policies, procedures,
and practices and directing aid ﬂexibly
through sectorwide approaches or the budget process would lower the high transaction costs in low-income countries and
allow recipients to pursue their objectives
more efﬁciently. That could be done if

•

•

•

Aid agencies want to be able to identify
their own contributions, often through
distinct “projects,” to facilitate feedback
to taxpayers and sustain political support for aid ﬂows. A new hospital is easier to showcase than the outcome of policy reform or budget support.
Aid agencies, facing disbursement pressures, need to show quick results to taxpayers—and NGOs, to their contributors. This is easier when donors are in
charge of interventions.
Politicians and policymakers in donor
countries cannot dismiss the interest
groups that support them, groups that
may place a high priority on funding likeminded groups in developing countries.
Many donors limit the market for aid
services and supplies to their own
nationals (tied aid). Foreign aid sustains
a large consultancy industry in OECD
countries—estimated at $4 billion a year
for Sub-Saharan Africa, or 30 percent of
aid to the continent.

Donors and service reform

•

•

•
•

Preferences for spending differ among
donors and between donors and recipients. Donors often are most comfortable
with service delivery systems of the type
operating in their own country. For
instance, British and Nordic advisers are
familiar with a clinic-based free health
service and so prefer to support those
systems in low-income countries too.
Fiduciary concerns and incentives in aid
agencies cause donors to focus on monitoring inputs and processes. Again, the
monitoring is easier in project aid where
the donor controls the design and implementation of each intervention.
Donors may want to persuade aid recipients of the value of a different approach
through a pilot project, to show success.
Bilateral donors distribute their aid budgets across a large number of recipients
and sectors, to increase the visibility of
their programs or to leverage or reward
diplomatic support from recipient
nations.588 More specialization among
sectors or recipients, however efﬁcient,
could expose a donor to charges that it is
neglecting, say, a global health crisis or a
regional humanitarian crisis. Such con-

siderations help explain why the typical
bilateral donor in 2000 provided ofﬁcial
development aid (ODA) to about 115
independent nations. Even omitting
recipients that received less than
$100,000, the mean number of ODA
recipients for each of the 22 major bilateral donors was 95.
These multiple objectives create incentives for donors to ﬁnance and directly control their aid interventions. That creates
problems for recipient countries: donors
often do not know (or don’t care) what
other donors and the recipient are doing,
which results in duplication, waste, and
gaps in services.589 These days donors tend
to favor social sector projects over other
public expenditures. If they do not pay
attention to what the others are doing, they
may concentrate too much on higher-priority sectors, leaving sectors with a lower priority, such as rural roads in Zambia, short
of funds. Or there may be gaps in the priority areas simply because nobody is looking
at the big picture. But priorities among
donors vary, and their approaches change
over time.590 So there is some scope—and
hope—for improvement.

34. Even a recommendation to apply interventions that pass a
social beneﬁt-cost analysis test will not be enough. Social beneﬁtcost analysis is concerned with valuing an intervention’s outputs
and inputs at the right set of shadow prices (Bell and Devarajan
(1987) and Dreze and Stern (1987)). Yet the problem is that the
inputs often do not translate to the desired output because of weak
incentives. The same point applies to recommendations of using

1981 and 1985 was 142 deaths per 1,000 births, for children born
between 1986 and 1990 the rate had fallen to 91, almost a 40 percent reduction. Infant mortality in the poorest ﬁfth of the population fell from 154 to 113—almost 30 percent. The decline in infant

capita was about $160 averaged over the 1990s and mortality 190 in
2000. These two countries fall very close to the cross-country
regression line between income and mortality. These data on child
mortality are from UNICEF (2002).

133. The result holds for other outcomes as well. For example,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s
Program for International Student Assessment found that more
spending on education was associated with better test results in a
sample of largely upper income countries (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2001)). However, the association becomes almost zero (and insigniﬁcant from it) once GDP
per capita is controlled for.

137. Rajkumar and Swaroop (2002); Gupta, Verhoeven, and
Tiongson (2002) ﬁnd corruption to be important, but Jayasuriya
and Wodon (2002) do not.
138. For example, the number of countries, and country coverage, in cross-national studies of spending and mortality are: 98 in
Filmer and Pritchett (1999b); 22 in Anand and Ravallion (1993); 76
and 56 in Jayasuriya and Wodon (2002); 22 in Gupta, Verhoeven,
and Tiongson (2002); 32 in Gupta, Verhoeven, and Tiongson
(forthcoming);116 in Gupta, Davoodi, and Tiongson (2002); 32 in
Wagstaff (2002); 35 in Bidani and Ravallion (1997). There is a parallel, although somewhat less developed literature on education
outcomes and spending: for example, Wößmann (2003); Gupta,
Verhoeven, and Tiongson (2002).
139. This discussion is based on Lieberman (2003).
140. Such expenditure incidence studies of health and education spending provide a valuable description, but they cannot tell
the full story. First, they provide a cross-sectional snapshot that is
not the same as who would beneﬁt from the marginal resources
devoted to the sector. Second, while the data are often based on the
best available they are limited—especially when it comes to assessing the costs of each unit of the service provided. Third, the studies
implicitly assume that the value of the expenditure is equal across

all users. Fourth, they do not include the incidence of raising
funds—that is, a fairly regressive pattern of spending might still be
pro-poor if it is ﬁnanced through a very progressive tax system.
Fifth, it is hard to know what a “good” allocation is without comparing it to other types of social spending.

Lampang and Bohol projects in Asia, as well as the Danfa, Kintampo, Kisantu, Kasongo and Institute of Child Health Nigeria projects in West Africa. These best practices were translated into a
coherent set of service delivery strategies, management systems,

(advocacy, lobbying, naming/shaming, participation in policymaking) sense.
225. Goetz and Jenkins (2002) and Schedler (1999). The many
meanings given to accountability—an overused term—often blur.
So, “vertical” accountability (citizens individually or collectively
holding the state to account, as in elections) is sometimes distinguished from “horizontal” accountability within government (a
minister or senior civil servant formally holding another civil servant accountable). Authoritarian states may manifest horizontal
accountability, but not offer much vertical accountability.

India’s public distribution system for basic goods targeted to poor
people. When the system was exploited as a source of patronage,
civil society groups advocating more efﬁcient delivery had no traction for their equity-led agenda, and the poor suffered.

outcomes in better-informed states were socially superior. It could
just as easily be the case that state governments in which media coverage of food crises was widespread devoted more resources to
assistance than they should have, including providing assistance
not only to those who needed it but also to those who didn’t but

327. Much of the debate is about how to properly isolate the
causal impact of variations in class size, mostly from nonexperimental data. This is a problem because if class size is consciously
chosen in ways that cause a correlation between performance and
class size—say, by school administrators who make classes with disruptive children (who would cause low performance) smaller (so
the teacher can better handle the situation) or by students, who,
given choice within a school will choose teachers with better reputations—then the observed, nonexperimental data might show a
negative or zero correlation between class size and performance
even though a truly exogenous shift in class size would improve performance. There is evidence of a reasonably large effect of class size
from a randomized experiment in Tennessee, and “quasi-experimental” evidence from Israel (Angrist and Lavy (1999), South
Africa (Case and Deaton (1999), and Bolivia (Urquiola (2001). But
critics of this evidence argue that reported results are “hit and
miss”—in that, if class size effects are measured in two subjects in
three grades, there are class size effects in some grades and subjects
and not others—with no particular pattern; that the literature is
subject to enormous “publication bias” in that statistically signiﬁcant results are much more likely to be written up and published,
even if they are in fact rare; and that randomized experiments in
which the teachers know the purpose of the experiment are not in
fact a clean test, as teachers will attempt to perform well to justify
smaller class sizes (Hoxby 2000). Hanushek (2002) continues to
emphasize the huge literature in which there is a general lack of a
correlation—with “better” studies less likely to ﬁnd effects—and
points to the “big picture” evidence unlikely to be affected by the
“endogeneity arguments”—the time series in the United States and
OECD countries in which class sizes have fallen substantially while
scores have stagnated, and the lack of cross-national evidence.
Hoxby (2000) produces quasi-experimental evidence from the
United States (Vermont) showing no class size effects and argues
her results are more typical and representative than others.

332. For instance, empirical studies that run standard wage (or
earnings) regressions with a few characteristics (age, gender, education) and include a dummy variable (or interaction terms) for
teachers provide a purely statistical answer to the question, “Does
the wage regression over- or underpredict wages (or earnings) of
teachers?” But even this answer is without a clear interpretation and
these studies do not, in themselves, answer the question, “Are teachers underpaid?’ (Psacharopoulos, Valenzuela, and Arends (1996);
Liang (1999); Filmer (2002); Vegas, Pritchett, and Experton (1999).
In some situations in which these regressions suggested that teachers were “underpaid” the annual output of teachers colleges
exceeded available positions by several-fold (suggesting teacher pay
was adequate), while in others where the regressions suggested
teachers were “overpaid” there were few new teachers and wages
were being increased (suggesting teacher pay was inadequate).

but left the expenditure law unclear on expenditure assignments.

Bank (2002d).

them conceptually can shed more light on the interactions between
them.

decentralization in Benin, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, the
Philippines, Poland, and Uganda.

544. Martens and others (2002) and Ostrom and others (2001).
545. Mackinnon (2003).
546.The literature on fungibility—including Devarajan and
Swaroop (1998); Devarajan, Rajkumar, and Swaroop (1999); and
Feyziogly, Swaroop, and Zhu (1998)—ﬁnds that only a portion of
aid stays in the sector: when the government receives sector-speciﬁc
aid, it shifts its own resources partially to other sectors. Fungibility
suggests that donors should take a more holistic approach to recipients’ public spending.
547. Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
548. World Bank (2001l).
549. For example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis
and Malaria; the Global Alliance for Vaccinations and Immunizations; the Global Vaccine Fund; and the Global Environment Facility. For details on health-related global funds see Kalter (2003).
550. Ostrom and others (2001).
551. Boyce and Haddad (2001).
552. World Bank (2001f).
553. Bräutigam (2000).
554. World Bank (1998a).
555. Cohen and Wheeler (1997).
556. Data for the Development Gateway are provided by the
OECD DAC and other donor sources over several decades. Unfortunately, the database has no indication of the number of projects
ongoing at any given time.
557. A Herﬁndahl index of donor concentration is ﬁrst calculated by summing the squared shares of aid over all donor agencies
operating in the recipient country (O’Connell and Saludo (2001)).
This index, which ranges from 0 to 1, is then subtracted from 1 to
form an index of donor fragmentation, with high values indicating
greater fragmentation (Knack and Rahman (2003)).
558. Index values do not necessarily rise with aid levels or number of projects: doubling each donor’s aid or number of projects
but keeping the number of donors and their activity shares constant leaves the index values unchanged.
559. Data are from the OECD DAC. The trend may overstate the
worsening of donor fragmentation to the extent pooling of donor

227

funds has also increased, because the index calculated on the basis
of disbursements does not distinguish pooled funds from nonpooled funds.
560. Knack and Rahman (2003). The Bureaucratic Quality
Indexes are subjective assessments from the International Country
Risk Guide (ICRG). High ratings reﬂect the “strength and expertise
to govern without drastic changes in policy or interruptions in government services.” Ratings are strongly correlated with more
detailed, independent assessments of “Weberian” bureaucratic
structure and stability (Evans and Rauch (1999)), available for a
subset of countries covered by the ICRG.

562. Picazo (2002).
563. Mansuri and Rao (2003).

578. World Bank (2002r).
579. Harrold and Associates (1995).
580. There have been a number of reviews of the sectorwide
approach, including Brown (2000a), Conway (2000), Foster (2000),
Foster, Brown, and Conway (2000), Jones (1997), Jones and Lawson
(2001), and ; World Bank (2001b).

582. Adam and Gunning (2002).
583. Brown (2000b).
584. Mackinnon (2003).
585. The perception—rather than the reality—of ﬁduciary risk
may reduce political support for foreign aid in the donor country.
But that is a political issue in rich countries, not a service-delivery
issue in poor countries.
586. World Bank (2002r).
587. World Bank (2002r).
588. Most bilateral donors give more aid to countries that vote
similarly to them in the United Nations General Assembly, where
each nation regardless of size has one vote (Alesina and Dollar
(2000) and Wang (1999)).
589. Halonen (2003).
590. See, for example, Tarp and Hjertholm (2000).

Introduction to Selected World
Development Indicators

T

his year’s edition presents comparative socioeconomic data for more than 134 economies in six
tables. An additional table provides data on basic
indicators for 74 economies with sparse data or with populations of less than 1.5 million. Data are for the most recent
year available and, for some indicators, an earlier year is provided for comparison purposes.
The ﬁrst two tables present data on the size of economies
and several indicators on non-income poverty that are
included in the Millennium Development Goals. Four additional tables cover data on special topics related to the main
WDR themes on health, education, service delivery, and foreign aid.
The indicators presented here are a selection from more
than 800 included in World Development Indicators 2003. Published annually, World Development Indicators reﬂects a comprehensive view of the development process. Its opening
chapter reports on the Millennium Development Goals which
grew out of agreements and resolutions of world conferences
organized by the United Nations (UN) in the past decade, and
reafﬁrmed at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 by
member countries of the UN. The other ﬁve main sections
recognize the contribution of a wide range of factors: human
capital development, environmental sustainability, macroeconomic performance, private sector development, and the
global links that inﬂuence the external environment for development. World Development Indicators is complemented by a
separately published database that gives access to over 1,000
data tables and 800 time-series indicators for 225 economies
and regions. This database is available through an electronic
subscription (WDI Online) or as a CD-ROM.

Data sources and methodology
Socioeconomic and environmental data presented here are
drawn from several sources: primary data collected by the
World Bank, member country statistical publications,
research institutes, and international organizations such as

the United Nations and its specialized agencies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Although
international standards of coverage, deﬁnition, and classiﬁcation apply to most statistics reported by countries and
international agencies, there are inevitably differences in
timeliness and reliability arising from differences in the
capabilities and resources devoted to basic data collection
and compilation. For some topics, competing sources of data
require review by World Bank staff to ensure that the most
reliable data available are presented. In some instances,
where available data are deemed too weak to provide reliable
measures of levels and trends or do not adequately adhere to
international standards, the data are not shown.
The data presented are generally consistent with those in
World Development Indicators 2003. However, data have been
revised and updated wherever new information has become
available. Differences may also reﬂect revisions to historical
series and changes in methodology. Thus data of different
vintages may be published in different editions of World
Bank publications. Readers are advised not to compile data
series from different publications or different editions of the
same publication. Consistent time-series data are available on
World Development Indicators 2003 CD-ROM and through
WDI Online.
All dollar ﬁgures are in current U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. The various methods used to convert from
national currency ﬁgures are described in the Technical
Notes.
Because the World Bank’s primary business is providing
lending and policy advice to its low- and middle-income
members, the issues covered in these tables focus mainly on
these economies. Where available, information on the highincome economies is also provided for comparison. Readers
may wish to refer to national statistical publications and publications of the OECD and the European Union for more
information on the high-income economies.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Classiﬁcation of economies
and summary measures
The summary measures at the bottom of each table
include economies classiﬁed by income per capita and by
region. GNI per capita is used to determine the following
income classiﬁcations: low-income, $735 or less in 2002;
middle-income, $736 to $9,075; and high-income, $9,076
and above. A further division at GNI per capita $2,935 is
made between lower-middle-income and upper-middleincome economies. See the table on classiﬁcation of
economies in this volume for a list of economies in each
group (including those with populations of less than 1.5
million).
Summary measures are either totals (indicated by t if
the aggregates include estimates for missing data and nonreporting countries, or by an s for simple sums of the data
available), weighted averages (w), or median values (m)
calculated for groups of economies. Data for the countries
excluded from the main tables (those presented in Table 7)
have been included in the summary measures, where data
are available, or by assuming that they follow the trend of
reporting countries. This gives a more consistent aggregated measure by standardizing country coverage for each
period shown. Where missing information accounts for a
third or more of the overall estimate, however, the group
measure is reported as not available. The Technical Notes
provides further information on aggregation methods.
Weights used to construct the aggregates are listed in the
technical notes for each table.

From time to time an economy’s classiﬁcation is revised
because of changes in the above cutoff values or in the economy’s measured level of GNI per capita. When such changes
occur, aggregates based on those classiﬁcations are recalculated for the past period so that a consistent time series is
maintained.

Terminology and country coverage
The term country does not imply political independence but
may refer to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics. Data are shown for
economies as they were constituted in 2002, and historical
data are revised to reﬂect current political arrangements.
Throughout the tables, exceptions are noted.

Technical notes
Because data quality and intercountry comparisons are often
problematic, readers are encouraged to consult the Technical
notes, the table on Classiﬁcation of economies by region and
income, and the footnotes to the tables. For more extensive
documentation see World Development Indicators 2003.

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

Technical notes
These technical notes discuss the sources and methods used
to compile the indicators included in this edition of Selected
World Development Indicators. The notes follow the order
in which the indicators appear in the tables.

Sources
The data published in the Selected World Development
Indicators are taken from World Development Indicators
2003. Where possible, however, revisions reported since the
closing date of that edition have been incorporated. In addition, newly released estimates of population and gross
national income (GNI) per capita for 2002 are included in
table 1.
The World Bank draws on a variety of sources for the statistics published in the World Development Indicators. Data on
external debt are reported directly to the World Bank by
developing member countries through the Debtor Reporting
System. Other data are drawn mainly from the United Nations
and its specialized agencies, from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), and from country reports to the World Bank.
Bank staff estimates are also used to improve currentness or
consistency. For most countries, national accounts estimates
are obtained from member governments through World Bank
economic missions. In some instances these are adjusted by
staff to ensure conformity with international deﬁnitions and
concepts. Most social data from national sources are drawn
from regular administrative ﬁles, special surveys, or periodic
censuses.
For more detailed notes about the data, please refer to the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators 2003.

Data consistency and reliability
Considerable effort has been made to standardize the data,
but full comparability cannot be assured, and care must be
taken in interpreting the indicators. Many factors affect data
availability, comparability, and reliability: statistical systems
in many developing economies are still weak; statistical
methods, coverage, practices, and deﬁnitions differ widely;
and cross-country and intertemporal comparisons involve
complex technical and conceptual problems that cannot be
unequivocally resolved. Data coverage may not be complete
for economies experiencing problems, such as those deriving
from internal or external conﬂicts, affecting the collecting
and reporting of data. For these reasons, although the data
are drawn from the sources thought to be most authoritative, they should be construed only as indicating trends and
characterizing major differences among economies rather
than offering precise quantitative measures of those differences. Also, national statistical agencies tend to revise their
historical data, particularly for recent years. Thus, data of
different vintages may be published in different editions of

World Bank publications. Readers are advised not to compile such data from different editions. Consistent time series
are available from the World Development Indicators 2003
CD-ROM.

Ratios and growth rates
For ease of reference, the tables usually show ratios and rates
of growth rather than the simple underlying values. Values
in their original form are available from the World Development Indicators 2003 CD-ROM. Unless otherwise noted,
growth rates are computed using the least-squares regression
method (see Statistical methods below). Because this method
takes into account all available observations during a period,
the resulting growth rates reﬂect general trends that are not
unduly inﬂuenced by exceptional values. To exclude the
effects of inﬂation, constant price economic indicators are
used in calculating growth rates. Data in italics are for a year
or period other than that speciﬁed in the column heading—
up to two years before or after for economic indicators and
up to three years for social indicators, because the latter tend
to be collected less regularly and change less dramatically
over short periods.

Constant price series
An economy’s growth is measured by the increase in value
added produced by the individuals and enterprises operating
in that economy. Thus, measuring real growth requires estimates of GDP and its components valued in constant prices.
The World Bank collects constant price national accounts
series in national currencies and recorded in the country’s
original base year. To obtain comparable series of constant
price data, it rescales GDP and value added by industrial origin to a common reference year, currently 1995. This process
gives rise to a discrepancy between the rescaled GDP and the
sum of the rescaled components. Because allocating the discrepancy would give rise to distortions in the growth rate, it
is left unallocated.

Summary measures
The summary measures for regions and income groups, presented at the end of most tables, are calculated by simple
addition when they are expressed in levels. Aggregate growth
rates and ratios are usually computed as weighted averages.
The summary measures for social indicators are weighted by
population or subgroups of population, except for infant
mortality, which is weighted by the number of births. See the
notes on speciﬁc indicators for more information.
For summary measures that cover many years, calculations are based on a uniform group of economies so that the
composition of the aggregate does not change over time.
Group measures are compiled only if the data available for a
given year account for at least two-thirds of the full group, as

(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

29_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd 8/14/03 4:13 PM Page 265

Selected World Development Indicators

deﬁned for the 1995 benchmark year. As long as this criterion is met, economies for which data are missing are
assumed to behave like those that provide estimates. Readers
should keep in mind that the summary measures are estimates of representative aggregates for each topic and that
nothing meaningful can be deduced about behavior at the
country level by working back from group indicators. In
addition, the estimation process may result in discrepancies
between subgroup and overall totals.

Table 1. Size of the economy
Population is based on the de facto deﬁnition of population,

which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship—except for refugees not permanently settled in the
country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the
population of their country of origin. The values shown are
midyear estimates for 2002. Population estimates are usually
based on national censuses, but the frequency and quality of
these vary by country. Errors and undercounting occur even
in high-income countries; in developing countries such
errors may be substantial because of limits in the transport,
communications, and other resources required to conduct a
full census. Intercensal estimates are usually interpolation or
extrapolations based on demographic models.
Surface area is a country’s total area, including areas
under inland bodies of water and some coastal waterways.
Population density is midyear population divided by
land area in square kilometers. Land area is a country’s total
area excluding areas under inland bodies of water and
coastal waterways.
Gross national income (GNI—formerly gross national
product or GNP), the broadest measure of national income,
is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any
product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation
of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. Data
are converted from national currency to current U.S. dollars
using the World Bank Atlas method. This involves using a
three-year average of exchange rates to smooth the effects of
transitory exchange rate ﬂuctuations. (See the section on statistical methods below for further discussion of the Atlas
method).
GNI per capita is gross national income divided by
midyear population. GNI per capita in U.S. dollars is converted using the World Bank Atlas method. The World Bank
uses GNI per capita in U.S. dollars to classify economies for
analytical purposes and to determine borrowing eligibility.
PPP Gross national income, which is GNI converted to
international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP)
conversion factors, is included because nominal exchange
rates do not always reﬂect international differences in relative prices. At the PPP rate, one international dollar has the

265

same purchasing power over domestic GNI that the U.S. dollar has over U.S. GNI. PPP rates allow a standard comparison of real price levels between countries, just as conventional price indexes allow comparison of real values over
time. The PPP conversion factors used here are derived from
price surveys covering 118 countries conducted by the International Comparison Programme. For Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development countries data
come from the most recent round of surveys, completed in
2000; the rest are either from the 1996 survey, or data from
the 1993 or earlier round, which have been extrapolated to
the 1996 benchmark. Estimates for countries not included in
the surveys are derived from statistical models using available data.
PPP GNI per capita is PPP GNI divided by midyear population.
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth is
based on GDP measured in constant prices. GDP is the sum
of value added by all resident producers plus any product
taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output.
Growth in GDP is considered a broad measure of growth of
an economy. GDP in constant prices can be estimated by
measuring the total quantity of goods and services produced
in a period, valuing them at an agreed set of base year prices,
and subtracting the cost of intermediate inputs, also in constant prices. Growth is calculated from constant price GDP
data in local currency.

Table 2. Millennium Development Goals:
eradicating poverty and improving lives
Share of the poorest quintile in national consumption is
the share of consumption (or, in some cases, income) that
accrues to the poorest 20 percent of the population. Data on
personal or household income or consumption come from
nationally representative household surveys. The data in the
table refer to different years between 1987 and 2001. Footnotes to the data indicate whether the ranking are based on
per capital income or consumption. Each distribution is
based on percentiles of population-rather than of households-with households ranked by income or expenditure per
person.
Prevalence of child malnutrition is the percentage of
children under ﬁve whose weight for age is less than minus
two standard deviations from the median for the international reference population ages 0–59 months. The reference
population, adopted by the World Health Organization in
1983, is based on children from the United States, who are
assumed to be well nourished. Estimates of child malnutrition are from national survey data. The proportion of children who are underweight is the most common indicator of
malnutrition. Being underweight, even mildly, increases the
risk of death and inhibits cognitive development in children.

Moreover, it perpetuates the problem from one generation
to the next, as malnourished women are more likely to have
low-birth-weight babies.
Primary completion rate is the total number of students
successfully completing (or graduating from) the last year of
primary school in a given year, divided by the total number of
children of ofﬁcial graduation age in the population. The primary completion rate reﬂects the primary cycle as nationally
deﬁned, ranging from three to four years of primary education (in a very small number of countries) to ﬁve or six years
(in most countries) and seven or eight years (in a relatively
small number of countries). For any country it is therefore
consistent with the gross and net enrollment ratios. The
numerator may include coverage children who have repeated
one or more grades of primary school but are now graduating successfully as well as who entered school early. The
denominator is the number of children of ofﬁcial graduation
age, which could cause the primary completion rate to exceed
100 percent. There are other limitations that contribute to
completion rates exceeding 100 percent, such as the use of
estimates for population, different times of the year that the
school and population surveys are conducted, and other discrepancies in the numbers used in the calculation
Ratio of female to male enrollments in primary and secondary school is the ratio of the number of female students
enrolled in primary and secondary school to the number of
male students. Eliminating gender disparities in education
would help to increase the status and capabilities of women.
This indicator is an imperfect measure of the relative accessibility of schooling for girls. With a target date of 2005, this is
the ﬁrst of the targets to fall due. School enrollment data are
reported to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics by national
education authorities. Primary education provides children
with basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills along
with an elementary understanding of such subjects as history, geography, natural science, social science, art, and
music. Secondary education completes the provision of
basic education that began at the primary level, and aims at
laying foundations for lifelong learning and human development, by offering more subject-or skill-oriented instruction
using more specialized teachers.
Under-ﬁve mortality rate is the probability that a newborn baby will die before reaching age ﬁve, if subject to current age-speciﬁc mortality rates. The probability is expressed
as a rate per 1,000. The main sources of mortality date are
vital registration systems and direct or indirect estimates
based on sample surveys or censuses. To produce harmonized estimates of under-ﬁve mortality rates that make use
of all available information in a transparent way, a methodology that ﬁts a regression line to the relationship between
mortality rates and their reference dates using weighted least
squares was developed and adopted by both UNICEF and
the World Bank.

Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who
die from pregnancy-related causes during pregnancy and
childbirth, per 100,000 live births. The data shown here have
been collected in various years and adjusted to a common
1995 base year. The values are modeled estimates based on
an exercise carried out by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF). In
this exercise maternal mortality was estimated with a regression model using information on fertility, birth attendants,
and HIV prevalence. This cannot be assumed to provide an
accurate estimate of maternal mortality in any country in
the table.
Births attended by skilled health staff are the percentage
of deliveries attended by personnel trained to give the necessary supervision, care, and advice to women during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period, to conduct deliveries on their own, and to care for newborns. The share of
births attended by skilled health staff is an indicator of a
health system’s ability to provide adequate care for a pregnant women. Good antenatal and postnatal care improves
maternal health and reduces maternal and infant mortality.
But data may not reﬂect such improvements because health
information system are often weak, material deaths are
underreported, and rates of maternal mortality are difﬁcult
to measure.

Table 3. Expenditures on education and health
Public expenditure per student is the public current spend-

ing on education divided by the number of students by level,
as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
Data on education are compiled by the UNESCO Institute
for Statistics from ofﬁcial responses to surveys and from
reports provided by education authorities in each country.
The data on education spending in the table refer solely to
public spending—government spending on public education plus subsidies for private education. The data generally
exclude foreign aid for education. They may also exclude
spending by religious schools, which play a signiﬁcant role in
many developing countries. Data for some countries and for
some years refer to spending by the ministry of education
only (excluding education expenditures by other ministries
and departments and local authorities).
Recurrent spending on primary teacher salaries is the
total amount spent on primary as a percent of total recurrent spending on primary education (the latter including
spending on personnel other than teachers). The data refer
to the primary education level of the education system only.
For countries with a ﬁve or six year primary system, the data
are for the ofﬁcial primary cycle. For countries with primary
systems either longer than 6 years, or shorter than 5 years,
the data are an estimate of a hypothetical 6-year equivalent
system (although based on actual enrollment, teacher,
spending data, etc. through grade 6 in that country). The

Selected World Development Indicators

data are estimates for 2000 based on the latest years for
which data are available. The data are derived from Bruns,
Mingat, and Rakatomalala (2003). Incidence of education
expenditures (lowest and highest quintiles).
Incidence of education and health expenditures (lowest
and highest quintiles). Average expenditure incidence studies relate household data on the use of public services by different quintiles of the population to average spending on
those services by the government. Results from these studies
provide a cross-sectional snapshot of who beneﬁts from
public spending on services. Note that this is not necessarily
the same as who would beneﬁt from the marginal resources
devoted to the sector. The data are accompanied by several
caveats. First, while the data are often based on the best
sources available, they are often limited when it comes to
assessing the unit costs of services. Second, cross-country
comparability is hampered by the fact that studies differ in
the detail to which they differentiate average spending: for
example some use a uniform estimate, some estimate separate unit costs for urban and rural areas, some for different
provinces, and so on. Third, since the value of spending
might differ for different populations (for example spending
on urban dwellers might go much further towards providing
quality services than an equal amount spent on people in
remote rural areas) the label “expenditure incidence” is distinguished from “beneﬁt incidence”. Fourth, the results do
not include the incidence of raising funds. A fairly regressive
pattern of spending might still be pro-poor if it is ﬁnanced
through a very progressive tax system. Fifth, it is hard to
know what a “good” allocation is without comparing it to
other types of social spending. Details on the sources for
these results, as well as a disaggregation by types of expenditures, are available in Filmer (2003) WDR Background Note.
Public health expenditure consists of recurrent and capital spending from government (central and local) budgets,
external borrowings and grants (including donations from
international agencies and nongovernmental organizations),
and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds. The data
in the table are the product of an effort by the World Health
Organization (WHO), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank
to collect all available information on health expenditures
from national and local government budgets, national
accounts, household surveys, insurance publications, international donors, and existing tabulations.
Private health expenditure includes direct household
(out-of-pocket) spending, private insurance, spending by
non-proﬁt institutions serving households (other than
social insurance), and direct service payments by private
corporations. The data in the table are the product of an
effort by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), and the World Bank to collect all available infor-

267

mation on health expenditures from national and local government budgets, national accounts, household surveys,
insurance publications, international donors, and existing
tabulations.
Total health expenditure is the sum of public and private
health expenditure. It covers the provision of health services
(preventive and curative), family planning activities, nutrition activities, and emergency aid designated for health but
does not include provision of water and sanitation. The data
in the table are the product of an effort by the World Health
Organization (WHO), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank
to collect all available information on health expenditures
from national and local government budgets, national
accounts, household surveys, insurance publications, international donors, and existing tabulations.

Table 4. Service indicators
Primary teacher absence rate is the percentage of primary
school teachers who were absent from a random sample of
schools during surprise visits.
Absenteeism of public servants from their jobs has long
been discussed as an impediment to effective public service
delivery in developing countries, yet there has been relatively
little systematic empirical evidence on this issue. As background research for this World Development Report, several
country studies were conducted. A multi-county study
Bangladesh, Ecuador, India (20 States), Indonesia, Peru, and
Uganda (Chaudhury and others 2003). Additional studies
with virtually identical methodologies were conduncted in
Papua New Guinea (NRI and World Bank 2003) and Zambia
(Habyarimana and others 2003).
The common survey methodology was built around
unannounced visits to a nationally representative random
sample of primary schools and primary health care centers.
The study used clustered random sampling: after stratifying
each country (or Indian state) geographically, districts were
randomly selected on a population-weighted basis, and then
facilities were randomly selected in each district. Enumerators visited each facility and, after verifying workers’ schedules, recorded which of them were absent.
The ﬁgures in the table are preliminary calculations,
based on data from surveys conducted mostly in late 2002
and early 2003. Further research will reﬁne the calculations,
in some cases drawing on data from additional visits to each
facility. In addition, these facility surveys have collected a
wealth of information now being used to probe the causes of
teacher and health personnel absence in the different countries.
Note that these studies did not measure “absenteeism,”
which is a term that is usually used to imply unjustiﬁable or
unexplained absence, but instead reported on rates of
“absence.” That is, they reported the number of staff who

WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004

were supposed to be on duty but were in fact absent from the
facility - without regard to the reasons for absence. Many
personnel were doubtless absent for valid reasons, such as
authorized leave or ofﬁcial duties. Nevertheless, we report
the absence rates for two reasons: ﬁrst, because the reasons
for absence given by facility directors were typically not veriﬁable; and second, because even authorized absences reduce
the quantity and quality of public services in these primary
schools and primary health centers.
Primary pupil-teacher ratio is the number of pupils
enrolled in primary school divided by the number of primary school teachers (regardless of their teaching assignment). The comparability of pupil-teacher ratios across
countries is affected by the deﬁnition of teachers and by differences in class size by grade and in the number of hours
taught. Moreover, the underlying enrollment levels are subject to a variety of reporting errors. They are based on data
collected during annual school surveys, which are typically
conducted at the beginning of the school year. They do not
reﬂect actual number of attendance. And school administrators may report exaggerated enrollments, especially if there
is a ﬁnancial incentive to do so. While the pupil-teacher ratio
is often used to compare the quality of schooling across
countries, it is often weakly related to the value added of
schooling systems (Behrman and Rosenzweig 1994). The
data are from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, which
compiles international data on education in cooperation
with national commissions and national statistical services.
Trained teachers in primary school: are the percentage
of primary school teachers who have received the minimum
organized teacher training (preservice or in service) required
for teaching. The share of trained teachers in primary
schools measures the quality of the teaching staff. It does not
take account of competencies acquired by teachers through
their professional experience or self-instruction, or of such
factors as work experience, teaching methods and materials,
or classroom conditions, all of which may affect the quality
of teaching. Since the training teachers receive varies greatly,
care should be taken in comparing across countries. The
data are from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, which
compiles international data on education in cooperation
with national commissions and national statistical services.
Health personnel absence rate is the percentage of medical personnel at primary health clinics who were absent
from a random sample of schools during surprise visits. (See
the technical notes on the primary teacher absence rate for
further information).
Child immunization rate is the percentage of children
under one year of age receiving vaccination coverage for four
diseases—measles and diphtheria, pertussis (whooping
cough), and tetanus (DPT). A child is considered adequately
immunized against measles after receiving one dose of vaccine, and against DPT after receiving three doses.

Tuberculosis treatment success rate is the percentage of
new, registered smear-positive (infectious) cases that were
cured or in which a full course of treatment was completed.
Data on the success rate of tuberculosis treatment are provided for countries that have implemented the recommended control strategy: directly observed treatment, short
course (DOTS). Countries that have not adopted DOTS or
have only recently done so are omitted because of lack of
data or poor comparability or reliability of reported results.
Physicians are graduates of any faculty or school of medicine who are working in the country in any medical ﬁeld
(practice, teaching, research). Data are from the WHO and
OECD, supplemented by country data.
Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public,
private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation
centers. In most cases beds for both acute and chronic care
are included. Data are from the WHO and OECD, supplemented by country data.
Inpatient admission rate is the percentage of the population admitted to hospitals during a year. Data are from the
WHO and OECD, supplemented by country data.
Access to an improved water source refers to the percentage of the population with reasonable access to an adequate amount of water from an improved source, such as a
household connection, public standpipe, borehole, protected well or spring, or rainwater collection. Unimproved
sources include vendors, tanker trucks, and unprotected
wells and springs. Reasonable access is deﬁned as the availability of at least 20 liters a person a day from a source within
one kilometer of the dwelling. The data are based on surveys
and estimates provided by governments to the Joint Monitoring Programme of the WHO and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The coverage rates for water are
based on information from service users on the facilities
their households actually use rather than on information
from service providers, who may include nonfunctioning
systems. Access to drinking water from an improved source
does not ensure that the water is safe or adequate, as these
characteristics are not tested at the time of the surveys.
Access to improved sanitation facilities refers to the percentage of the population with at least adequate access to
excreta disposal facilities (private or shared but not public)
that can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect contact with excreta. Improved facilities range from simple but
protected pit latrines to ﬂush toilets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facilities must be correctly constructed
and properly maintained. The data are based on surveys and
estimates provided by governments to the Joint Monitoring
Programme of the WHO and United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF). The coverage rates for sanitation are based
on information from service users on the facilities their
households actually use rather than on information from
service providers, who may include nonfunctioning systems.

Table 5. Foreign aid recipient indicators
Net ofﬁcial development assistance or ofﬁcial aid cover net
concessional ﬂows to developing countries, transition
economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
and to certain advanced developing countries and territories
as determined by the Development Assistance Committee
(DAC) of the OECD. The ﬂows are from members of the
DAC, multilateral development agencies, and certain Arab
countries. Data on aid are compiled by DAC and published
in its annual statistical report, Geographical Distribution of
Financial Flows to Aid Recipients, and in the DAC chairman’s
annual report, Development Co-operation. The 2001 data
exclude aid from the World Food Programme because the
organization implemented an annual program budget in
2002, and the 2001 data are not yet consistent with the DAC
reporting system.
Aid dependency ratios Net ofﬁcial aid or ofﬁcial development assistance as a percentage of GNI, gross capital formation and central government expenditure and aid per
capita provide a measure of the recipient country’s dependency on aid. They are calculated using values in U.S. dollars
converted at ofﬁcial exchange rates. Gross capital formation
consists of outlays on additions to the ﬁxed assets of the
economy, net changes in the level of inventories, and net
acquisitions of valuables. Central government expenditure
includes both current and capital (development) expenditures and excludes lending minus repayments. For deﬁnitions of population and GNI, please see table 1.
Donor fragmentation index A Herﬁndahl index of
donor concentration is calculated by summing the squared
shares of aid over all donor agencies with positive gross disbursements of ofﬁcial development assistance (ODA/OA) in
the recipient country during the year. This index, which
ranges from 0 to 1, is then subtracted from 1, to form an
index of donor fragmentation, with high values indicating
greater fragmentation. Data, and list of donor agencies, are
from the OECD DAC’s Geographical Distribution of Financial Flows to Aid Recipients.

Table 6. Aid ﬂows from Development Assistance
Committee members
Net ofﬁcial development assistance and net ofﬁcial aid
record the actual international transfer by the donor of
ﬁnancial resources or of goods or services valued at the cost
to the donor, less any repayments of loan principal during
the same period.
DAC maintains a list of countries and territories that are
aid recipients. Part I of the list comprises developing countries and territories considered by DAC members to be eligible for ODA. Part II comprises economies in transition:
more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the
countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced

269

developing countries and territories. Flows to these recipients that meet the criteria for ODA are termed ofﬁcial aid.
Measures of aid ﬂows from the perspective of donors differ from recipients’ perceived aid receipts for two main reasons. First, aid ﬂows include expenditure items about which
recipients may have no precise information, such as development-oriented research, stipends and tuition costs for aidﬁnanced students in donor countries, or payment of experts
hired by donor countries. Second, donors record their concessional funding (usually grants) to multilateral agencies
when they make payments, while the agencies make funds
available to recipients with a time lag and in many caes in the
form of soft loans where donors’ grants have been used to
reduce the interest burden over the life of the loan. All data
in this table—including GNI, population, general government disbursement—come from and are calculated by the
OECD.
Data are shown at current prices and dollar exchange
rates.
Aid as a percentage of GNI shows the donor’s contributions of ODA or ofﬁcial aid as a share of its gross national
income.
Average annual percentage change in volume and aid
per capita of donor country are calculated using 2000
exchange rates and prices.
Aid as a percentage of general government disbursement shows the donor’s contributions of ODA as a share of
public spending.
Untied aid is the share of ODA that is not subject to
restrictions by donors on procurement sources.

Table 7. Key indicators for other economies
Population is based on the de facto deﬁnition of population,
which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship—except for refugees not permanently settled in the
country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the
population of their country of origin. The values shown are
midyear estimates for 2002.
Surface area is a country’s total area, including areas
under inland bodies of water and some coastal waterways.
Gross national income (GNI) is the sum of value added
by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net
receipts of primary income (compensation of employees
and property income) from abroad. Data are in current U.S.
dollars converted using the World Bank Atlas method (see
the technical notes for Table 1 and the section on statistical
methods).
GNI per capita is gross national income divided by
midyear population. GNI per capita in U.S. dollars is converted using the World Bank Atlas method.
PPP gross national income (GNI) is gross national
income converted to international dollars using purchasing

power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GNI as a U.S. dollar has in the United
States. (See the technical notes for Table 1).
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth is
based on GDP measured in constant prices. GDP is the sum
of value added by all resident producers plus any product
taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output.
Growth is calculated from constant price GDP data in local
currency. (See the technical notes for Table 1).
Life expectancy at birth is the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at
the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.
Reduce child mortality—under-ﬁve mortality rate is
the probability that a newborn baby will die before reaching
age ﬁve, if subject to current age-speciﬁc mortality rates. The
probability is expressed as a rate per 1,000.
Primary completion rate is the number of students successfully completing the last year of (or graduating from)
primary school in a given year, divided by the number of
children of ofﬁcial graduation age in the population.
Adult illiteracy rate is the percentage of adults ages 15
and above who cannot, with understanding, read and write a
short, simple statement about their everyday life.

Statistical methods
This section describes the calculation of the least-squares
growth rate, the exponential (endpoint) growth rate, and the
World Bank’s Atlas methodology for calculating the conversion factor used to estimate GNI and GNI per capita in U.S.
dollars.
Least-squares growth rate. Least-squares growth rates are
used wherever there is a sufﬁciently long time series to permit a reliable calculation. No growth rate is calculated if
more than half the observations in a period are missing.
The least-squares growth rate, r, is estimated by ﬁtting a
linear regression trendline to the logarithmic annual values
of the variable in the relevant period. The regression equation takes the form
ln Xt = a + bt,

which is equivalent to the logarithmic transformation of the
compound growth equation,
Xt = Xo (1 + r)t .

In this equation, X is the variable, t is time, and a = log Xo
and b = ln (1 + r ) are the parameters to be estimated. If b* is
the least-squares estimate of b, the average annual growth
rate, r, is obtained as [exp(b*)–1] and is multiplied by 100 to
express it as a percentage.
The calculated growth rate is an average rate that is representative of the available observations over the entire period.

It does not necessarily match the actual growth rate between
any two periods.
Exponential growth rate. The growth rate between two
points in time for certain demographic data, notably labor
force and population, is calculated from the equation
r = ln (pn /p1 )/n,

where pn and p1 are the last and ﬁrst observations in the
period, n is the number of years in the period, and ln is the
natural logarithm operator. This growth rate is based on a
model of continuous, exponential growth between two
points in time. It does not take into account the intermediate
values of the series. Note also that the exponential growth
rate does not correspond to the annual rate of change measured at a one-year interval which is given by
(pn – pn – 1)/pn – 1.

World Bank Atlas method. In calculating GNI and GNI per
capita in U.S. dollars for certain operational purposes, the
World Bank uses the Atlas conversion factor. The purpose of
the Atlas conversion factor is to reduce the impact of
exchange rate ﬂuctuations in the cross-country comparison
of national incomes.
The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the average of a
country’s exchange rate (or alternative conversion factor) for
that year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years,
adjusted for the difference between the rate of inﬂation in
the country, and through 2000, that in the G-5 countries
(France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States). For 2001 onwards, these countries include
the Euro Zone, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. A country’s inﬂation rate is measured by the change
in its GDP deﬂator.
The inﬂation rate for G-5 countries (through 2000), or
the Euro Zone, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
States (for 2001 onwards), representing international inﬂation, is measured by the change in the SDR deﬂator. (Special
drawing rights, or SDRs, are the IMF’s unit of account.) The
SDR deﬂator is calculated as a weighted average of the G-5
countries’ (through 2000, and the Euro Zone, Japan, the
United Kingdom, and the United States for 2001 onwards)
GDP deﬂators in SDR terms, the weights being the amount
of each country’s currency in one SDR unit. Weights vary
over time because both the composition of the SDR and the
relative exchange rates for each currency change. The SDR
deﬂator is calculated in SDR terms ﬁrst and then converted
to U.S. dollars using the SDR to dollar Atlas conversion factor. The Atlas conversion factor is then applied to a country’s
GNI. The resulting GNI in U.S. dollars is divided by the
midyear population to derive GNI per capita.

Selected World Development Indicators

When ofﬁcial exchange rates are deemed to be unreliable
or unrepresentative of the effective exchange rate during a
period, an alternative estimate of the exchange rate is used in
the Atlas formula (see below).
The following formulas describe the calculation of the
Atlas conversion factor for year t:
et*

 p
1
= e t − 2  t

 pt − 2

 p
ptS $ 
+ et −1  t
ptS−$2 
 pt −1


ptS $ 
+ et 
ptS−$1 


and the calculation of GNI per capita in U.S. dollars for
year t:
Y $t = (Yt /Nt)/e*t

where et* is the Atlas conversion factor (national currency to
the U.S. dollar) for year t, et is the average annual exchange
rate (national currency to the U.S. dollar) for year t, pt is the

271

GDP deﬂator for year t, pt S$ is the SDR deﬂator in U.S. dollar terms for year t, Yt $ is the Atlas GNI per capita in U.S.
dollars in year t, Yt is current GNI (local currency) for year t,
and Nt is the midyear population for year t.

Alternative conversion factors
The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness
of ofﬁcial exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the ofﬁcial exchange rate
is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from
the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. This applies to only a
small number of countries, as shown in Primary Data Documentation table in World Development Indicators 2003. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology
and elsewhere in the Selected World Development Indicators
as single-year conversion factors.
