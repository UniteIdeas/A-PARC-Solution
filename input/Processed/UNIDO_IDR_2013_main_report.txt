Foreword

Since the eruption of the
financial crisis in 2008,
much of the public debate
has focused, after decades
of silence, on development
economics: how to sustain growth, create lasting
jobs, generate incomes and
enable the accumulation
of wealth, thus eradicating
the scourge of poverty and preventing social polarization and fragmentation. The rising number of unemployed people in industrialized economies, the unrest
in the streets of Northern Africa, the increasingly
vocal demands from voters in emerging economies
and the discussion towards a new international agenda
for development, all point in the same direction – at
the central role that productive activities and jobs have
in the life of individuals and countries.
Yet, despite a legitimate wish for the contrary, jobs
simply do not fall like manna from heaven. They arise
out of economic development, from private entrepreneurs and governments generating new businesses and
economic activities. Sustained job creation requires
structural change, or the ability of an economy to
constantly generate new fast-growing activities characterized by higher value added and productivity and
increasing returns to scale.
Since the industrial revolution, manufacturing
has been at the core of structural change, consistently
creating higher levels of output and employment, and
leading to an unprecedented growth in incomes. The
rising incomes led, in turn, to greater demand for
manufactured goods and a relative decline in spending on agricultural products. Productivity gains raised
demand further as prices of manufactures declined
even more relative to those of other goods and services. Accompanying these changes were major shifts
in the labour force and population from agriculture
and rural areas, initially into manufacturing and to

urban areas, and later into services. This experience
has repeated itself across the globe, wherever countries
have achieved a mature stage of economic and social
development.
For developing countries aiming to maintain
growth while sustaining job creation, manufacturing
offers an opportunity not only to rebalance the economy towards higher value-added sectors but also to
provide a relatively wide employment base with higher
labour productivity. The transition from agriculture to
services, especially for low-income countries, offers the
opportunity to achieve only the first objective, not the
second.
UNIDO’s Industrial Development Report 2013
provides a solid foundation to correctly frame the
debate on jobs in the world today. Manufacturing
remains an important employer, accounting for
around 470  million jobs worldwide in 2009 – or
around 16 percent of the world’s workforce of 2.9 billion. Moreover, the report provides a detailed and
largely path-breaking account of how structural
change has taken place over the last 40 years.
One of the key findings of this report is that
countries need to move from lower tech to higher
tech sectors, from lower value-added to higher valueadded sectors and from lower productivity to higher
productivity sectors. The structural change analysis
performed for this report indicates that while conditions may vary significantly across time and space and
technological change may still bring large surprises,
the trends of the past are very likely to stretch into the
future. There is much to learn from understanding
history and what drove it. And there is much to learn
by developing countries from countries both slightly –
and further – ahead of them.
The report highlights how, nearly 40 years
after Member States of UNIDO issued the Lima
Declaration at the Second General Conference of
the Organization in 1975, in which they expressed
their firm conviction of industry’s role as a dynamic

instrument of growth essential to the rapid economic
and social development of the developing countries,
particularly the least developed countries, the underlying principles have stood the test of time: industrialization remains an indispensable route to development. Industry increases productivity and generates
income, reducing poverty and providing opportunities
for social inclusion. As countries further develop their
industries, the motivation to increase value added
drives a greater application of science, technology and
innovation, encourages more investment in skills and
education and provides the resources to meet broader
development outcomes.
As the global community embarks on formulating a new development agenda to build on the foundation laid by the Millennium Development Goals,
the report underscores the need for integrating inclusive and sustainable industrial development into this
new agenda. This calls for an expansion of productive
capacities and a growth of responsible value addition
to encourage increased job creation and income generation, while respecting planetary boundaries and
ensuring an efficient use of scarce resources. It is only
through inclusive and sustainable industrial development that countries around the world, be they industrialized or developing, will be able to achieve the
socially equitable and ecologically sustainable economic growth that generates employment and income,
and creates the wealth to achieve wider developmental
goals for health, education and human rights.
Structural transformation of the economy lies at
the heart of this process, together with conscious and
considered measures to encourage economic growth,
enhanced productivity and the development of technology, innovation, infrastructure and trade. The
report provides ample guidance on how to initiate and

sustain such a process – by exploring the key drivers
of structural change and providing practical policy
options for governments of countries at different levels
of development.
The state can use policy instruments to target key
drivers. Education and skills, for example, would be
underprovided in a pure market-driven environment
as employers have too few incentives to allocate funds
for these public goods. Similarly, limited returns on
investment, lack of competitive finance and coordination failures make technology and innovation prone
to market failures, resulting in underinvestment. Such
market failures can be addressed through targeted
policy measures to reduce input costs where the market is unable to provide a reliable supply system of lowcost and high-quality material inputs critical to local
industries.
It gives me great pleasure to present this report at
this early stage of my tenure as Director General of
UNIDO. I am particularly pleased that the report
underlines the critical need for international cooperation to achieve the structural change and economic
growth required to combat poverty, and reaffirm the
commitment of my Organization to fulfil its unique
mandate in support of this effort. I am grateful to
the UNIDO staff and the international experts that
joined hands to produce this report, and look forward
to seeing it become a key component in the development debate.

Glossary

Backward linkage. Input-output production relation
between suppliers and purchasers from the viewpoint of purchasers.
Bilateral investment treaties (BITs). Agreements
between two countries to promote and protect
investments in each other’s territories.
Capital goods. Goods used in the production of other
goods and services.
Commodification. Transformation of goods into
undifferentiated products whose prices are increasingly determined by greater application of a market
mediation characterized as perfect competition.
Corporate social responsibility. Ethical and moral
responsibilities that corporations have in addition
to their responsibilities to comply with law and
regulations.
Decoupling. Weakening or breaking the link between
environmental effects and economic activity so
that output increases with a less than commensurate increase (or with a decrease) in energy consumption (Von Weizsäcker 1989; Enevoldsen,
Ryelund and Andersen 2007). Absolute decoupling in industry is when the decrease in material,
energy and pollution intensity is greater than the
growth rate in manufacturing (OECD 2002;
Spangenberg, Omann and Hinterberger 2002).
Relative decoupling is when the growth rate of
manufacturing value added is higher than that of
industrial energy consumption.
Deindustrialization. Long-term decline in manufacturing relative to other sectors. Typically measured
in terms of a share of manufacturing employment
in total employment.
Elasticity. Percent change in one due to 1 percent
change in another. For example, the growths of
value added, employment and labour productivity
as per unit increase in GDP per capita can be measured as percentage change in these variables due
to 1 percentage point increase in GDP per capita.
Income elasticity of demand is percentage change

in demand due to 1 percentage point change in
income.
Externalities. Costs or benefits that accrue to unrelated third parties. When it is a benefit reaped by
third parties, it is called a positive externality.
When it is a cost imposed on third parties, it is
called a negative externality. Externality is a market failure that provides rational for industrial policy. Hausmann and Rodrik (2003, 2006) identify
three main types of externalities that are particularly relevant for new activities to emerge: coordination externalities, as specific new industries or
activities require simultaneous, large investments
to become profitable; information externalities,
as “discovery” of new activities requires an investment whose returns cannot be fully appropriated
by the investor; and labour training externalities,
as firms regard labour mobility as a disincentive to
invest in on-the-job training, thus reducing technological spillovers.
Gross cell product. A measure of geographical concentration, based on the output per area of 1 degree
longitude by 1 degree latitude.
Induced effects. Impact on household spending due
to changes in income.
Industrial energy efficiency. The ratio of the useful
or desired output of a process to the energy input
into a process; for a higher aggregated level (sector,
economy or global), the ratio of the amount of economic activity produced from one unit of energy.
Industrial energy intensity. The amount of energy
used to produce one unit of economic activity
across all sectors of an economy; related to the
inverse of energy efficiency but only at the sectoral,
economy or global level.
Industrial policy. Any type of intervention or government policy that attempts to improve the business
environment or to alter the structure of economic
activity towards sectors, technologies or tasks that
are expected to offer better prospects for economic

growth or societal welfare than would occur in the
absence of such intervention – that is, in the market equilibrium (Warwick 2013).
Informal economy. It is part of the economy that is
operated outside the purview of government, thus
not taxed and included in statistics.
Input-output multiplier effects. Effects leading
to an increase in output, which is greater than
the amount of initial final demand. For example,
demand for 100 vehicles would increase total output of the economy greater than the value of 100
vehicles because the demand increases not only the
output of direct inputs to vehicle production but
also the output of indirect inputs (inputs to suppliers, inputs to the suppliers’ suppliers and so on).
Intermediate goods. Goods used as inputs in the production of other goods and services
Labour intensity. Relative proportion of labour used
in production. It is approximated in this report as
the number of employment per unit of value added.
Manufacturing-related service / producer-related
service. Service activities whose demands
arise largely from manufacturing production.
Wholesale, retail, transportation services for goods
and business services (including, for example, renting services of machinery and equipment, research
and development, and computer and related services) are considered major components of manufacturing-related services.
Manufacturing value added. See value added.
Non-manufacturing industries. Industries that
comprise mining and quarrying, construction and
public utilities (electricity, gas and water).
Purchasing power parity (PPP). A concept that
determines the relative values of two currencies in
terms of purchasing power. PPP-based GDP shows
what goods and services produced in one country
would cost if they were sold in the United States.
Since non-tradable services of similar quality are
priced lower in low-income countries than they are
in the United States, their PPP-based GDPs usually become higher than their GDPs based on market exchange rates.

Private return to education. Private rate of returns to
education is calculated using after-tax earnings differentials and only those educational costs actually
borne by the student or their family (Amin and
Awung 2005).
Process innovation. Innovation that alters the system
of production to reduce costs or improve quality.
Product innovation. Innovation that alters the product mix by creating either genuinely new products
or products adapted from existing designs.
Skill-biased technological change. Technological
change that does not lead to proportional change
in the demand for unskilled and skilled labour but
results in greater demand for skilled labour.
Social return to education. Social rates of return
are based on before-tax earnings differentials or
total earnings and the total resources the society
incurred on education (Amin and Awung 2005).
Structural change. Change in the long-term composition and distribution of economic activities. A
normative perspective of structural change often
emphasizes desirability in the direction of change.
For example, Ocampo (2005), Ocampo and Vos
(2008) and UNDESA (2006a) define structural
change as the ability of an economy to continually generate new dynamic activities characterized
by higher productivity and increasing returns to
scale.
Technological levels of manufacturing industries.
Manufacturing industries can be grouped into
three technological categories – low tech, medium
tech and high tech. They are based on research and
development intensity relative to value added and
production, following the technology classification
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD 2005). In this report
high tech and medium-high tech of the OECD
classification are combined and called high tech,
and medium-low tech industry of the OECD classification is called medium tech.
Total factor productivity. A variable that represents
the amount of output not accounted for by the
amount of factor inputs, such as labour and capital.

services such as payments for contract and commission work and repair and maintenance, compensation of employees, operating surplus and
consumption of fixed capital. Manufacturing
valued added is the contribution of the entire
manufacturing sector to GDP (manufacturing
net output).

Glossary

Unit labour costs. Cost of labour per unit of output.
It is calculated as the ratio of labour costs to real
output.
Value added. A measure of output net of intermediate consumption, which includes the value of

The role of manufacturing
and structural change

Manufacturing – with around 470 million jobs in 2009, or one in six jobs globally – still matters for employment generation. In 2013, there likely are more than half billion jobs in manufacturing.
Manufacturing employment is rising in developing countries and falling in developed countries, but the declines in
developed countries are mitigated by the growth of manufacturing-related services.
Least developed countries have immense potential for industrialization in food and beverages (agroindustry), and
textiles and garments, with good prospects for sustained employment generation and higher productivity.
Middle-income countries can benefit from entering the basic and fabricated metals industries, which offer a range of
products necessary for investment and are demanded by the more advanced industries and which are facing rapidly
growing international demand.
Developed countries have great possibilities for investing and innovating in high-tech industries and for sustaining
jobs in these industries’ related services.
Industrialization improves not only the number of jobs but also their quality in all countries.
Manufacturing concentrates in cities at early stages of development and “suburbanizes” at later stages. Cities thus
remain crucial for industrialization in developing countries.

Jobs do not fall like manna from heaven. They arise
from the process of economic development and from
the efforts of entrepreneurs and governments to generate new enterprises and economic activities. Sustained
job creation requires structural change, that is, the
ability of an economy to constantly generate new
fast-growing activities characterized by higher value
added and productivity as well as increasing returns
to scale. Manufacturing offers greater opportunities
than other sectors to accumulate capital, exploit economies of scale, acquire new technologies and – more
fundamentally­– foster embodied and disembodied
technological change. It is thus the core of economic
growth and structural transformation.
Since the industrial revolution, manufacturing has driven output and employment, sparked
by improvements in mechanization and leading to
unprecedented incomes. The higher incomes have led
to greater demand for manufactured products and a
relative decline in spending on agricultural goods.
Productivity gains raised demand further as the prices
of manufactures declined even more relative to those
of other goods and services. Accompanying these

changes were major labour force and population shifts
from agriculture and rural areas into manufacturing
and urban areas, and later into services.
The role of manufacturing changes as structural
change evolves. At lower incomes the application of low
capital-intensive technologies allows for improvements
in both productivity and employment. As the capital
intensity of technology increases, productivity gains
dominate and employment shifts towards manufacturing-related and other services. Manufacturing remains
an important employer, with around 470 million jobs
worldwide in 2009 – or around 16 percent of the world’s
workforce of 2.9 billion – a figure far higher than many
might expect (Figure S1). Manufacturing must therefore
have more than half a billion jobs in 2013.
For developing countries aiming to maintain
growth while sustaining job creation, manufacturing
offers an opportunity not only to re-balance the economy towards higher value-added sectors but also to
provide a relatively wide employment base with higher
than average labour productivity. This contrasts with
a direct transition from agriculture to services, especially for low-income countries. Services offer the

opportunity to achieve only the first objective, not the
second. Least developed countries, mainly in Africa,
have openings in low-tech labour intensive industries
like agroindustry, textiles and apparel (see also Lin
2012). Middle income countries could benefit from
entering medium-tech industries such as basic and
fabricated metals. Although they do not generate large
amounts of employment they are high-productivity
industries and can generate resources for investment.
Their products include steel, bricks, cement, boilers,
metallic structures, hand tools and plastics, most of
them intermediate goods in high demand by more
advanced industries and enjoying growing international demand. Manufacturing also offers the potential to boost wages and incomes, helping to create a
domestic market.
The impact of manufacturing structural change on
employment also has a spatial dimension. Shifts in the
relative shares of industries go hand in hand with geographical shifts in the location of people, often driven
by trade. Historically manufacturing moved from the
United Kingdom to Continental Europe and to the
2

United States and later to Japan. Today it is moving
towards East Asia, including the Republic of Korea
and mainland China. Yet employment is not equally
distributed between emerging and traditional industrial powerhouses. And within countries manufacturing is usually more geographically concentrated in
cities during the structural change from agriculture to
manufacturing, reflecting agglomeration economies.
However, this trend has reversed somewhat in developed economies – which are “suburbanizing” – as services become more important.
The impact of within-manufacturing structural
change – the shift from low-, to medium-, to hightechnology industries – on employment varies by
type of industry. Low-tech industries produce vast
employment opportunities and some possibilities for
capital accumulation. Medium- and high-tech industries offer opportunities for capital accumulation but
generate less employment than do low-tech industries.
High-tech industries offer, in addition, openings for
innovation and new knowledge and skill development
and thus the capacity to invent new industries and

produce employment opportunities.

Drivers of structural change in manufacturing

Costs, as well as technology and demand, remain critical drivers of structural change and industrial development.
Matching the type of skills to the structure of industry as incomes grow can drive industrial structural change.
Product innovation results in structural transformation and generates employment through the creation of new business opportunities.
Resource efficiency, emerging as a major driver of structural change and industrial development, will be even more
important in the future.
The impact of the drivers of structural change on sustaining employment depends on the industrial policies adopted.

Traditional and emerging drivers
The previous section depicted structural change across
sectors and within manufacturing industry and the
relationship to employment. But what are the drivers
of this structural change? And how do they sustain
employment through structural change? Certainly the
interactions are extremely diverse, complex and nonlinear. This section discusses the reasons for structural
change in manufacturing.
In principle, structural change in any sector in
any country is governed by the conditions of demand
and supply for products and services that interact
with each other. Supply-side conditions generally
include wages, skills, technological change, industrial
organization and the overall business environment,
which also determine the competitiveness of industry.
Demand-side conditions include demand for imports
and exports as well as foreign direct investment (FDI).
Often, some of these drivers work through both
demand and supply.
Wages are both a constraint on and a result of
the process of structural transformation. They are

a constraint in that high wages may push investors
away from a project, particularly in labour-intensive
industries, although most investors do not take investment decisions on wages alone but also look into
other factors like productivity, infrastructure, logistical facilities and supplies (cost and availability). Too
high wages may prompt a withdrawal of investment,
leading to deindustrialization and falling employment, while attractive wages may generate more and
new work opportunities. Wages are also a result of the
process of structural change – as workers move up to
higher value-added industries and raise their productivity, they receive higher salaries.
Skills need to be attuned to the structure of the
industry and change over time as industrialization
proceeds (Table S1). Most sophisticated industrial sectors require different types of skills than less advanced
ones. Advanced industries require highly specialized manufacturing skills with a focus on technical
subjects such as engineering and mathematics and
strong technical and vocational education and training. Intermediate industries require a low base of

engineering and scientific skills, and early industries
need literacy, numeracy and simple technical and
managerial training. However, as these set of skills
are cumulative, it takes time to build the skill base for
structural transformation.
Improvements in technology raise productivity
and hence are a major driver of structural change, yet
their effect on employment is negative as they normally
increase the capital intensity of industry and reduce
labour needs. More generally, however, innovation usually favours structural change through shifts in production processes and the generation of new products (and
eventually industries), but their impact on employment varies. Most process innovation aims to increase
efficiency or save on inputs and so reduce labour, but
product innovation (by creating new business opportunities) normally leads to more jobs. What matters for
employment is the net effect of both dimensions.
The organization of industry affects processes of
structural transformation through a mix of firm size;
4

extent of economies of scale in production; degree of
production fragmentation across value chains; and
the nature of spatial distribution and clustering of
production within national economies. An industrial
organization geared towards large firms and sectors
will make it harder for the economy to shift to more
advanced industries, while a more balanced combination, which includes a significant proportion of small
and medium-sized enterprises, may allow for more
economic flexibility and potential for advancement as
well as generate more employment.
International trade promotes structural transformation through demand-side effects including
expanding the size and scope of local business, which
do not need to rely solely on the domestic market to
grow further. Supply-side effects include the potential for substituting imports as local producers capture markets initially served by imports; exposing
local firms to foreign competition and technology,
which may lead to significant productivity gains; the

“

Countries need to move from lower- to

higher-tech, from lower value-added to higher
value-added, and from lower-productivity to
higher-productivity sectors, industries and
activities if they want to develop industrially

and other commodities. Efficient use of inputs, therefore, has clear economic advantages, boosting competitiveness and generating resources for investing in
further growth and structural transformation.
Drivers as necessary conditions
As said at the start of this report, jobs do not fall like
manna from heaven – and neither of course is structural change imposed this way. Yet one of the key
themes of this report is that countries need to move
from lower- to higher-tech, from lower value-added
to higher value-added, and from lower-productivity
to higher-productivity sectors, industries and activities if they want to develop industrially. The structural change analysis for this report indicates that
while conditions may vary greatly across time and
space and that technological change may still throw
up huge surprises, the regularities from the past are
very likely to stretch into the future. There is much
to learn from understanding history and what drove
it. And developing countries can learn much from
countries that are ahead of them – far ahead or even
just slightly.
The impact of drivers on structural change, however, has not been, and will not be, unambiguous.
Wages can support – or hinder – employment generation depending on how they are set. The timing of the
availability of skills seems to be crucially important
to support the emergence of new jobs. Technology
sheds labour if it is process oriented but generates
labour if it is product oriented. International trade
does not always lead to a virtuous circle of structural
change and employment, as the contrasting experiences of East Asia and Latin America illustrate. A
simple examination of each of the drivers will reveal
that their impact may go in either direction, which is
complicated by the fact that drivers often interact with
each other before generating an impact.
The state (alongside the private sector) needs to
work hard at ensuring that the drivers have a positive impact on employment generation while transforming the economy. Through government policy
targeting key drivers, such as education and skills,

possibility of capturing valuable externalities and
dynamic returns to scale; and by generating opportunities for attracting additional FDI. Yet the evidence
suggests that the impact of international trade is
ambiguous and depends on additional economic and
policy conditions.
Global value chains (GVCs) help structural transformation by segmenting the production process and
facilitating the relocation of production. In producing a final product in one location, there may be little
scope for changing the capital–labour ratio, but once it
becomes possible to fragment production into a series
of stages there will inevitably be some that are more
labour intensive than others and, with low transport
and communication costs, it may be cost effective to
locate these in a low-wage economy. Technologically,
participating in value chains makes industrialization
“easier and faster” but at the same time locally “less
meaningful”, as firms in developing countries can link
to international production networks and draw on the
technological and marketing prowess of the lead firms
in these chains while not making the effort themselves
(Baldwin forthcoming). GVCs’ impact on employment tends to be positive, though it also depends on
whether local production has been displaced.
FDI influences structural change by encouraging
the development of clusters and exploitation of cluster
economies (when domestic investment is unavailable).
It promotes diversification into new sectors, particularly when it is attracted to new high-tech sectors, and
through spillover effects, which make local firms more
competitive and attract local firms into new activities.
FDI does not, however, automatically generate structural change, as spillovers only work if local entrepreneurs are involved.
Resource constraints have traditionally not been
a driver of structural change but, given the polluting
impact of industrialization in the past, environmental protection will become a key driver in the future.
Further, wasteful production and consumption patterns – along with continued soil degradation, deforestation and overfishing – are already exacerbating
water shortages and escalating prices for food, energy

Executive summary

appropriability and/or international trade, governments can set in motion a virtuous rather than a
vicious circle involving structural change. Well-run
interventions can promote industrial growth and
employment, as confirmed by the results of recent
impact evaluations for high-income countries. By promoting positive structural change at all development
stages and by overseeing close coordination with
other policies so that there is consistency in action,

governments can have a major impact on sustaining
employment generation. But developing countries
should not simply emulate high-income countries,
and may well benefit from showing flexibility in
experimenting, learning and evaluating.
Drivers are thus necessary conditions for successful
structural change but will require a good set of wellcoordinated government policies in order to make
industrialization work for employment generation.

National and international industrial policy
Key messages
•	
•	
•	
•	

Achieving sustained employment generation requires industrial policies to focus on the structural transformation of
the economy.
The state can promote industrial policy either as a regulator, financier, producer or consumer. It should oversee
close coordination with other policies as they can undermine the objectives of industrial policy if they are misaligned.
For industrial policy to be effective, the policy-making process is as important as the policy content.
International cooperation in the areas of labour standards, investment and sustainable economic development targets after 2015 is key to ensure that industrialization generates much needed high-quality jobs.

Promoting structural change
Industrial policy – the main objective of which is to
“anticipate structural change, facilitating it by removing obstacles and correcting for market failures”
(Syrquin 2007) – should seek to promote such change
at each stage of development, in four main ways: as a
regulator establishing tariffs, fiscal incentives or subsidies; as a financier influencing the credit market and
allocating public and private financial resources to
industrial projects; as a producer participating directly
in economic activity through, for example, state enterprises; and as a consumer guaranteeing a market for
strategic industries through public procurement programmes (Peres and Primi 2009).
At an early stage of industrialization (from agriculture to low-technology manufacturing), industrial policy should primarily aim to align agricultural
and industrial policies and create or support labour-­
intensive and resource-based manufacturing with low
entry barriers; towards the middle-income stage, by
improving manufacturing’s efficiency and productivity
6

and through diversifying and upgrading the economic
structure; and at an advanced stage through technological innovation, pursuing both differentiation by raising quality and innovation by launching new products
and services, including green technology.
Targeting key drivers of structural change
The state can use policy instruments to target key
drivers. Education and skills, for example, would be
underprovided in a pure market-driven environment
as employers have too few incentives to provide funds
for them. Similarly, limited appropriability, lack of
competitive finance and coordination failures make
technology and innovation prone to market failures,
resulting in underinvestment (Martin and Scott
2000). And as a reliable supply system of low-cost and
high-quality material inputs is critical to local industries, countries sometimes use policy instruments to
reduce input costs.
The targeting of key drivers requires close coordination with other policies – notably on competition,

“

Coordination is particularly important

because competition and industrial policies
are often viewed as mutually conflicting

Developing skills
Most governments agree that human capital is a crucial driver of economic growth. Some of the elements
in successful skill policies are: appreciating the complexity of industrial skill needs; matching short-term
needs and long-term goals; creating skills gradually
and sequentially; matching supply and demand; and
aligning skill policies with the broader socio-economic agenda.
At the “hard end”, manufacturing employers are
not just looking for technical skills but also for cognitive, social and behavioural skills. Some consider team
work and problem solving key for blue-collar workers,
and critical thinking crucial for white-collar workers

(Bodewig 2012). Many of these soft skills have to be
developed at an early age, hence the importance of
supporting policies that establish the learning foundations of the future workforce. Beyond that stage, the
last few decades have seen a strong emphasis on technical and vocational education and training (TVET)
to meet the demand for industrial skills. Private sector involvement – through, for example, inter-firm
linkages and university–private sector collaboration,
including on-the-job training – is crucial because this
is the most efficient way to link skills to the labour
market (DFID 2011).
Still, lack of financing for high-quality TVET
remains a bottleneck, but it remains important to produce training for the informal sector, both to develop
that sector and to strengthen the link between the
informal and formal sectors, making it easier for
workers to move to the latter.

Executive summary

trade and FDI, and exchange rates – that play an
important complementary role to industrial policy.
Failure to ensure synergies may counteract policy
objectives. Coordination is particularly important
because competition and industrial policies are often
viewed as mutually conflicting, as the former typically
aims to foster rivalry between firms in an industry (for
greater efficiency and economic welfare), while the latter frequently gives a market advantage over competitors to favoured domestic sectors or industries.
Coordination among trade and FDI policies
helped, for example, former low-income countries
such as the Republic of Korea to catch up, and today
despite restrictions imposed by bi- and multilateral
trade policy agreements, governments still have some
space to use trade-related instruments for industrial
policy, especially non-tariff barriers (Chang 2003).
They can also use export-promotion instruments that
support exporters’ access to competitive financing,
research and development (R&D) and training.
Measures such as close monitoring of the real
exchange rate and keeping it undervalued to support
the tradable sector, primarily manufacturing (including manipulation of the nominal exchange rate), have
featured in almost all successful catch-up countries
(for example, Rodrik 2008a). They are also crucial in
preventing the current account deficit from becoming
unsustainable (McCombie and Thirlwall 2004).

Getting industrial policy to work
Carefully chosen and implemented interventions can
promote industrial growth and employment, as confirmed by evidence from the results of impact evaluations for high-income countries published in 2010 and
2012. For instance, subsidies to manufacturing firms
can increase employment at comparably very low cost
per job (Criscuolo et al. 2012). Well-allocated firmlevel subsidies can also boost total factor productivity
(Aghion et al. 2012), and tariffs that account for the
varying skill levels among industries have the potential
to boost economic growth (Nunn and Trefler 2010).
These types of studies must be interpreted with
great caution, however. First, many were not performed thoroughly enough and hence an assessment
of their internal validity suggests that causal relationships between policy instruments and observable
impacts are hard to establish. Second, the findings on
the achievements or failures that can be distilled from
international experiences cannot easily be generalized
because of country heterogeneity.
One upshot, though, is that evidence-based and
realistic industrial policy run in a consensual way,
which is key for effectiveness, irrespective of the
7

Each country has to go through its own

learning process – combining industrial
policy experimentation with rigorous impact
evaluation to generate an evidence base on

Executive summary

concrete instruments used. Thus those making such
policy should:
•	 Use – do not fight – the political system. A fact of
political life is that no policy will be underwritten
unless those in power agree to it.
•	 Strengthen political leadership. This will set a
national transformation agenda that aims, in lowincome countries, to create and nurture productive activities or, in middle-income countries, to
advance technologically.
•	 Encourage public–private dialogue. This will help
both in designing interventions that draw on expert
knowledge in the private sector and in ensuring
that all key stakeholders support decisions.
•	 Boost industrial policy management capabilities.
These have to be strengthened considerably among
key actors in developing countries in a pragmatic
and concentrated way.
International experience with policy instruments
can provide interesting lessons, but developing countries are unlikely to succeed with simple emulation of
high-income economies because a strategic approach to
forming industrial policy has to be tailored to national
circumstances. Each country has to go through its
own learning process – combining industrial policy
experimentation with rigorous impact evaluation to
generate an evidence base on which industrial policy
measures work, and which do not, in a given context.

Cooperating internationally
International cooperation on structural change is
required to prevent any “race to the bottom”, where
firms in rich countries could be tempted to relocate
to low-income countries with lower labour costs, less
restrictive labour laws, and weaker monitoring of
labour conditions and environmental impacts. At the
same time, to address these challenges, national regulators need a measure of policy autonomy, a position
that may be at odds with international cooperation
through trade agreements.
Cooperation is also required for the fairly new area
of “private sustainability standards”, which emerged
once social activists discovered that reputation was
a firm’s tangible asset that they could easily harm.
Another key legal instrument for international cooperation is the bilateral investment treaty, which can
allay concerns of expropriation.
As the world examines how to move beyond the
Millennium Development Goals after 2015, it can
look to build a framework with goals anchored in the
three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – of sustainable development. Generating new
employment is a pivotal global social concern as well
as challenge, and the post-2015 agenda offers a new
opportunity for states to recouple considerations for
sustainable manufacturing and employment with the
focus on human development.

Trends in manufacturing valued added and in manufactured exports
Manufacturing value added
The world’s manufacturing value added (MVA)
reached an all-time high of $8,900  billion in 2012
(16.7 percent of global GDP), recovering fully from
the sharp contraction of 2008–2009 caused by the
global economic and financial crisis. MVA’s share in
GDP in industrialized countries fell from 16.4 percent
in 1990 to 15.0  percent in 2012, when it rose from
16.5 percent to 21.3 percent in industrializing countries. (See Annex 8 for classification of industrialized
and industrializing economies.)
8

Between 1992 and 2012 global MVA nearly doubled, averaging 3 percent annual growth. While industrialized countries’ MVA expanded by a mere 1.8 percent a year, below their 2.1 percent GDP growth for
the period, MVA in industrializing countries rose
more than three-fold, at an annual rate of 6.4  percent, faster than their 5.0 percent GDP growth rate
(Table S2). The outcome was a near-doubling in industrializing countries’ share in world MVA, from 18 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in 2012 and a mirroring
retreat of industrialized countries from the world’s

Manufacturing in industrializing countries is geographically highly concentrated, with the five leading
economies accounting for 70.9 percent of total production in 2012, up from 52.7 percent in 1992. The high
and sustained MVA growth in China over this period
(11.4 percent on average) is behind its emergence as
the factory of the world: in 2012, 50 percent of industrializing-country manufactured goods was produced
in China. Of all other large industrializing-economy

manufacturers, only India (7.4 percent average annual
MVA growth) kept pace with China’s expansion. It
gained MVA share to become the second leading manufacturer among industrializing economies, superseding Mexico and Brazil, which saw their MVA shares
fall by more than half from 11.7 percent and 10.5 percent in 1992 to 5.7 percent and 4.9 percent in 2012.
Turkey’s steady MVA growth (4.5 percent on average
a year over 1992–2012) enabled it to preserve its position as the fifth largest manufacturer among industrializing economies.

Executive summary

Manufactured exports
A feature of the current organization of manufacturing
is the increased use of international production networks to carry out different stages of the production
process across borders, made possible by large scales of
production, advances in technology (especially microelectronics) and affordable transport costs.
The result of this production sharing has been
a larger increase in trade than the corresponding
increase in MVA. World exports grew by 6.4 percent
annually between 2007 and 2011 to reach $16.7 trillion in 2011, more than 80 percent of it consisting of

manufactured products. In the same period, world
output expanded on average by just 1.5 percent a year,
as many countries were hit hard by the economic crisis
in 2008–2009.
In 2011 world manufactured exports peaked at
$13,469 billion, growing faster than MVA and GDP
over 2007–2011 (Table S3). They recovered fully from
the contraction that followed the crisis, due mainly to
the expansion in exports from large industrializing
countries such as China and India.
Industrialized countries’ manufactured exports
grew by just 3.7  percent annually over 2007–2011,

Section 1  Industrial structural change and manufacturing employment

Ever since the industrial revolution, manufacturing has been the “engine of growth” for output
and employment, sparked by major technological
change and mechanization and leading to unprecedented and sustained long-term economic growth
and rising incomes. The higher incomes led to an
increase in demand for manufactured products and
a relative decline in spending on agricultural goods.
Productivity gains raised demand further as prices of
manufactures declined even further relative to other
goods and services. Accompanying these changes were
major labour force and population shifts from agriculture and rural areas, initially into manufacturing
and to urban areas, and later into services. This selfreinforcing industrial development process lasted for
decades, if not centuries, as a result of which what have
become today’s developed economies generated hundreds of millions of jobs in industry.
Indeed, manufacturing still matters greatly for
employment today: broadly defined to include formal
and informal activities and manufacturing-related

14

services, it accounted for around 470 million jobs in
2009 – or one out of six jobs on the planet.
In this first section, three chapters look at the elements that make manufacturing an engine of growth.
Chapter  1 analyses the trends of structural change
(also called structural transformation) over the last
50 years. Chapter 2 then focuses on spatial differences
among countries and regions, and within countries.
And Chapter 3 looks more closely at structural change
in manufacturing itself.
Some key findings are that manufacturing employment is growing in developing countries and decreasing in developed countries, though that decline is
mitigated by growing manufacturing-related services
employment. And while many developing countries
have immense potential to industrialize in agroindustry, textiles and garments – industries that offer
prospects for sustained employment generation and
productivity gains – developed countries have great
scope for pursuing high-tech innovation and sustaining related services jobs.

Chapter 1

Structural change and
employment trends
This chapter attempts to make sense of the trends of
structural change over the last 50 years. Structural
change unfolds over time but is best analysed through
the structure of countries’ economies with the same
income level, even if that is attained at different points
in time. The structural change of an economy is not
just associated with the growth of that economy, but
lies at its very core, because it corresponds to a transition from lower to higher productivity sectors. Up
to roughly the income level of advanced economies,
one can grasp such a transition by looking at shifts
from one sector to another (mainly from agriculture
to industry and services), but at higher incomes, average employment-to-output ratios converge and further
evidence of structural change can only be seen within
sectors.
For developing countries aiming to maintain
growth while creating sustainable jobs, manufacturing offers an opportunity not only to rebalance the
economy towards higher value-added sectors but
also to provide a relatively wide employment base
with higher labour productivity. This contrasts with
a direct transition from agriculture to services, especially for low-income countries, which offers the
opportunity to achieve only the first objective, not the
second. Manufacturing can be an important absorber
of labour while paying above-average wages.
The employment effect of manufacturing is
stronger than conventional statistics derived from
industry surveys suggest, which usually count only
formal sector jobs in firms above a certain size and
exclude self-employed and unregistered workers. Nor
do those statistics cover manufacturing-related jobs in
services, notably those jobs that have been unbundled
from manufacturing and that statistically used to be
counted in manufacturing but are now in services.
At most, the conventional data caught half the total
number of jobs directly and indirectly created by manufacturing, but when the sector is broadly defined to
include formal, informal and manufacturing-related

services, manufacturing worldwide in 2009 provided
almost 470  million jobs, employing around 16  percent of the world’s workforce of 2.9 billion, a figure far
higher than many commentators might expect.
The quality of jobs – wages, conditions of work
and rates of female employment – is also an important
contribution of manufacturing. The chapter closes
with a review of manufacturing’s comparative performance in these areas.
Industrialization, structural change
and economic growth
Industrialization in the long run
The United Kingdom in the 18th century was the first
country to develop manufacturing. Only in the early
19th century (after the United Kingdom had already
demonstrated significant increases in productivity)
did Belgium, France and Switzerland, followed by the
United States, enter their own paths of manufacturing
development. After this a few other latecomers (notably
Germany, Japan and Russia) joined the group of industrializing nations, while the developing world (colonies
and non-colonies) remained oriented towards primary
production (Gerschenkron 1962; Maddison 2007).
This sustained process lasted for decades, even centuries, for the United Kingdom (Box 1.1), with data
suggesting that manufacturing jobs in factories grew
from around 22 percent of total employment in 1841
to more than 35 percent in 1960 (Matthews, Feinstein
and Odling-Smee 1982). In the United States – where
data can be traced back even further – manufacturing employment grew from around 6 percent of total
employment in 1800 to around 36 percent in 1960,
a period when the population increased 33-fold.
Moreover, not only did the rate of employment rise,
but its quality in terms of wages, labour conditions
and skill levels also improved.
At the start of the 20th century, the world economy
was already divided into industrial rich economies and

Box 1.1	
Self-reinforcing industrial development

Structural change and employment trends

Manufacturing has been the engine of growth for output and employment since the industrial revolution. The
mechanization of manually based economic activities­
– such as the production of textiles or iron making –
as well as increasing power generation, and growing
regional and international trade facilitated by improvements in transport, led to unprecedented, sustained
long-term economic growth and rising incomes. Continually rising incomes, in turn, led to greater demand
for manufactured products and relatively lower outlays
on agricultural goods.
The manufacturing industry began to benefit
from scale factors and from continued technological
change, resulting in a rapid rise in productivity. Productivity gains raised demand as prices of manufactures
declined even further relative to other goods and services. Manufacturing employment initially grew in the
newly mechanized economic activities as unit costs of
labour fell. Later, as the income elasticity of demand
for textiles and iron products decreased and their
capital intensity grew, labour shifted to other emerging
industries, which saw rising demand and productivity
growth. Accompanying these trends were major labour
force and population shifts from agriculture and rural
areas, initially into manufacturing and to urban areas,
and later into services.

agricultural poor economies. Industrialization had
become synonymous with wealth, economic development, technological leadership, political power
and international dominance (Szirmai, Naudé and
Alcorta 2013). Countries failing to industrialize or,
even more significantly, countries experiencing deindustrialization, such as India prior to independence,
were perceived to be on an unsustainable development
trajectory.
After World War II more countries began to enter
the catch-up phase, thanks to the greater opportunities for technology transfer and the industrial policies
of “developmental states”. Countries that failed to
maintain robust growth of the manufacturing sector
or where industrial policies were deliberately reversed,
as in Latin America, failed to keep the momentum
16

behind the catch-up phase, curtailing broader social
welfare gains (Bértola and Ocampo 2013).
Structural change and economic
development
A large body of empirical evidence shows that manufacturing can be catalytic in transforming the economic structure of agrarian societies. In fact, the very
concept of economic development is intrinsically
linked to the changes in the structure of economic
activity that take place as countries become richer.
But the concept of structural change is open to
many interpretations and has been used extensively in
the literature without a clear consensus on its meaning. From a strictly positive perspective, structural
change would be defined as any long-term change in
the composition of an aggregate. This would typically
refer to the relative importance of sectors in the economy or to changes in the location of economic activity
(Syrquin 2010).
The term has also been approached from a normative perspective that emphasizes desirability in the
direction of change. Desirability might be defined
according to different sectoral characteristics, among
which the level and dynamism of productivity and
the scope for technological opportunities are typically
the most important. Authors such as Ocampo (2005),
Ocampo and Vos (2008) and UNDESA (2006a)
define structural change as the ability of an economy
to constantly generate new dynamic activities characterized by higher productivity and increasing returns
to scale. On this second approach, structural change
emerges as a central feature of the development process and an essential element in explaining the rate and
pattern of growth. It can impede growth if its pace is
too slow or its direction inefficient but can contribute
to growth if it improves the allocation of resources
(Syrquin 2010). As Justin Yifu Lin points out: “All
countries that remain poor have failed to achieve
structural change, that is, they have been unable to
diversify away from agriculture and the production of
traditional goods into manufacturing and other modern activities” (Lin 2012, p. 3).

“

All countries that remain poor have been

unable to diversify away from agriculture
and the production of traditional goods into
manufacturing and other modern activities

Other developing countries took a different path.
In the largest Latin American economies – Argentina,
Brazil and Mexico – the structure shifted from agriculture towards services (and to a lesser extent, nonmanufacturing industries). Taking the period’s end
points, manufacturing’s share remained unchanged,
but throughout the period it showed an inverted U
shape (Tregenna 2013).
This difference is seen in two developing economies that in 1960 had the same GDP per capita: the
Republic of Korea and Ghana (Figure 1.1). In 1960
their structures were quite similar (the main difference was that manufacturing’s share in the Republic
of Korea was 5 points higher than in Ghana, and agriculture’s share was 6 points lower).
Forty-five years later, these structures had changed
radically. The Republic of Korea had transformed
its structure, heavily reducing agriculture’s share by
increasing that of manufacturing, but in Ghana agriculture remained the largest sector. Tellingly, and in
line with a more normative understanding of structural change, the economic performance of the two
countries was radically different, such that in 2005
Ghana’s GDP per capita was only a tenth of that of
the Republic of Korea. The country that changed the
structure of its economy saw far stronger GDP per
capita growth than the one that did not.
The above suggests two conclusions. First, any
average across a heterogeneous sample of observations
(such as resource-rich countries, small countries, large
countries or regional groups) lends itself to identifying
a pattern over time that is not particularly representative of any single country’s performance. Second, and
more significant, the degree of heterogeneity inside
the sample may become even greater as time passes,
precisely as an outcome of structural change.
It is therefore instructive to look at how structural
change takes place by looking at the changing importance of sectors at different incomes instead of different moments in time. The approach now proposed in
this subsection provides a way to visualize structural
change by controlling for important features that
shape differently the pattern of structural change of

Structural change and employment trends

In the rest of this subsection we will stick to the
first, positive definition and analyse the patterns of
the last half century, looking exclusively at the changing contribution to gross domestic product (GDP)
of the major sectors: agriculture, non-manufacturing
industries,1 manufacturing industries and services. In
the next subsection we will focus on manufacturing’s
role in economic development, and therefore interpret
structural change from the normative perspective, as
the reallocation of resources from low-productivity
activities towards manufacturing.
A first approach is to analyse the changing importance of these four sectors’ shares in GDP at different
points in time for different countries (Table 1.1).
The last two rows provide a general impression of
the main trends of structural change over the last half
century in 68 developing and 21 advanced economies.
In 1950 almost 40 percent of developing countries’
GDP originated in agriculture and only 12 percent in
manufacturing. Fifty-five years later the share of agriculture had dropped to just 16 percent of GDP. In the
interim, manufacturing industries had first increased
their share in GDP (peaking at around 17 percent in
the early 1980s) but that share later fell. Throughout
these years services showed a steady increase, gaining
more than 10 percentage points.
In contrast, in 1950 advanced economies were
already based heavily on manufacturing (at almost
30  percent of GDP) and agriculture accounted for
only a minor share (16 percent). These economies, too,
became much more services oriented, but manufacturing showed a steady decline and by 2005 it had almost
the same share as in developing countries.
One feature that stands out in Table 1.1 is the wide
variety of patterns, even within developing countries.
At mid-century in China, Indonesia, the Republic of
Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, for example, agriculture accounted for at least 40  percent of GDP, and
manufacturing for 14 percent at most. Fifty-five years
later, agriculture accounted for only 3–13  percent
of GDP and manufacturing for more than 25  percent, underlining the huge shift from agriculture to
manufacturing.

countries as they become richer. A complementary
view to the more traditional analysis of structural
change over time, it has the advantage of providing a unique picture to illustrate the general pattern
of structural change, without averaging the important differences in structure that arise from different
incomes and two country-specific characteristics (natural resources and population).
This approach pools countries together not according to any prior definition of development (such as
advanced versus developing) but according to their
income at any point in time (Box 1.2). Structural
change can then be seen as the set of transformations
that takes place as countries become richer, regardless
of the time it occurred and its speed. With our previous example, the Republic of Korea and Ghana would
be pooled together in 1960 (when they had similar
incomes and economic structure) but not in 2005

(with a 10-fold difference in GDP per capita and dissimilar structures).
At very low incomes (for some countries in the
sample a contemporary feature, for others a feature of
the early 1960s), agriculture accounts for a relatively
high share of GDP, typically larger than manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries together. This
situation is reversed as income grows: manufacturing starts gaining ground and reaches a peak of about
20  percent of GDP at roughly $14,000. 2 In other
words economic development is associated with a near
tripling of the share of manufacturing in the economy,
largely at the expense of agriculture, whose share
shrinks dramatically (Figure 1.2).
After the peak the share of manufacturing starts
declining and at very high incomes is comparable to
earlier stages of development (describing an inverted
U shape). As incomes rise, even in the initial stages
of development, services’ share keeps growing and
agriculture’s declines. Non-manufacturing industries show a sharp increase at very low incomes, but
after peaking at around $4,000 they maintain a stable share. Overall, the graph does not display significant changes at higher incomes or for high-income
countries.
A key point is that structural change viewed at such
an aggregate level with only sectors masks important
features of what happens inside each sector (manufacturing is discussed in Chapter 3), including important
breaks and heterogeneities within the timespan and
sample of countries considered. Regression results
reveal significant time breaks over 1963–2007 and the
significance of population size and natural resources
on the patterns of structural change (Chapter 3). The
masking of these features should not be read as invalidating the underlying econometric analysis, but their
omission from the analysis would. The above figure
depicts a pattern with all else being equal – if time,
population size and resource endowments are kept
constant. The following figures depict what happens
when they are not.
To begin with, according to our econometric
results, the following periods seem to have shown a

seem to have remained statistically stable
for the 20 years before and after that

Box 1.2	
A few methodological issues

Structural change and employment trends

The approach used can be challenged on methodological
grounds. First, criticisms might be raised over comparing
different countries at different points in time. Second, the
pattern of structural change might itself change over time,
especially over half a century. Finally, pooling together
countries that are extremely heterogeneous by population size and natural endowments might draw a misleading picture in which important characteristics that shape a
country’s structure are averaged, ruling out the possibility of seeing the detail of structural change within each
sector.
To tackle the first issue, each country’s income at
each point in time is assessed using a measure that strips
out the impact of inflation (constant prices rather than
current prices) and in a manner that enables comparison
across countries where costs of living are very different1
and may reflect short-term distortions in exchange rates
(countries are characterized by income according to their
GDP per capita in 2005 purchasing power parity dollars).
So despite its limits, this approach should minimize the
potential biases of comparing the income of, say, a country in 1963 and another in 2007.
The second and third issues are more problematic,
and can only be addressed through econometric techniques that allow a statistical test for the significance of
a wide range of variables. In the following analysis, the
sectoral shares of GDP at different incomes are calculated

significantly different pattern of structural change
across incomes: 1963–1980, 1981–1990 and 1991–
2007. In other words the patterns of structural change
significantly shifted twice in the 1980s but seem to
have remained statistically stable for the 20 years
before and after that. Readers familiar with global economic trends will not be surprised by such a conclusion, as many of the features of economic globalization
picked up strongly in that decade.3
For the exposition’s sake, we show only the figures
for the two end points, 1963–1980 and 1991–2007,
and we focus on incomes up to $25,000, as that allows
us to concentrate on the earlier, more interesting, part
of the graph.
Most important for this chapter, the patterns in
the two periods in Figure 1.3 are strikingly in line
with that in Figure 1.2: structural change remained a
20

using regression analysis, which allows for exploring
whether these countries can be pooled together, and
whether there are some time- or country-specific characteristics that should be considered when evaluating
the general patterns of structural change. This approach
allows for studying whether these patterns are stable over
time and across countries with different characteristics.
The analysis is undertaken for a large panel dataset
of 100 countries over 1963–2007, though not all countries are represented for all years. Fixed effects are introduced to account for the fact that each country enters the
sample several times and that the observations for some
countries (especially high-income ones) are more numerous. For reasons of space, the details on the econometric
approach and main regression results are not presented
here. 2 The focus instead is on the resulting charts, which
show each economic sector’s estimated share at different
per capita incomes, and thus the main structural transformations as countries become richer.

process with broadly comparable features – with slight
differences. In the earlier period (1963–1980) manufacturing reached its peak at a lower per capita income
than in the second period (1991–2007), at $14,000
instead of $16,000. Moreover, manufacturing’s share
at this earlier period peak was much higher, at 24 percent of GDP instead of 20 percent. But looking at the
lowest incomes (less than $3,000 per capita), industrialization seems to set in faster in the more recent
period.
Taken together, these elements appear to suggest
that, bar the lowest income countries, industrialization has become more elusive in the new international context, a fact also documented in the literature (see, for example, Fagerberg and Verspagen 2002
and Szirmai and Verspagen 2010). In addition, the
role of manufacturing in a country’s economy seems

to have eroded over the last half century, which is
again compatible with the widely held idea of global
deindustrialization.

Two other characteristics specific to the countries
in the large sample are natural resource endowments
and population size. As stressed in the literature,
these elements might have an important impact on
the pattern of structural change. To study them, we
have to split the regression sample to avoid analytical
problems. Countries are identified as rich in natural
resources based on a proxy variable calculated as the
difference between exports and imports of crude natural resource commodities and expressed in per capita
terms.4 Countries with at least $4,000 on this measure are defined as rich in natural resources.5 Countries
with a population of more than 12 million are classified as large.
Our analysis supports the idea that these particular country characteristics are important. Both natural resource endowments and population size seem to
have a significant impact on the transformations that
take place in the productive structure as countries
become richer (Figure 1.4).
Once more, the patterns are in line with the
aggregate picture. Both cases see a shift from agriculture towards services and industry at low incomes;
later, industry starts declining and services become
dominant. The importance of manufacturing and the
income level at which the turning point takes place are
quite different though.
With natural resource–rich countries, the importance of manufacturing at any level of income is lower
than in the aggregate picture. The decline in its share
starts at much lower income ($13,000). The importance of non-manufacturing industries is larger. And
the maximum is only reached at very high income
($25,000). These trends are in line with a large body
of literature that highlights the potential bottlenecks
arising from a rich natural resource base, where the
economy’s incentives might be biased towards nonmanufacturing industries (or agriculture), to manufacturing’s detriment, leading to a “natural resource
curse” or “Dutch disease” (see, for example, Palma
2005).
Large economies show exactly the opposite trend:
manufacturing accounts for a much higher share of

GDP at all incomes and the turning point is reached
only at $24,000, when manufacturing accounts for
almost 25 percent of GDP. This pattern is sustained
with a lower share of services at all incomes. The
greater importance of manufacturing in large economies is probably related to their larger domestic market, which enables them to exploit economies of scale
even at low levels of development.
Manufacturing and economic growth
Although the positive perspective simply refers to
a change in the composition of an aggregate (in this
case, the sectoral composition of GDP), the normative
perspective expands this definition by including the
notion of desirability in the direction of that change.
Shifts in the economy from low-productivity activities
with limited opportunities for technological change
22

and value-added gains towards high-productivity
activities with larger opportunities for innovation and
value-added expansion would thus become the core
of structural change and – more broadly – economic
development.
Once structural change is understood from this
latter perspective, manufacturing becomes one of the
main engines of economic growth, and thus any shift
of resources from low-productive activities (such as
rural agriculture or urban informal services) towards
manufacturing entails an important structural change
bonus, in what some authors have labelled “growthenhancing structural change” (McMillan and Rodrik
2011).
The literature presents several arguments to support the idea that manufacturing is the main engine of
economic growth. Perhaps the most influential came
from Nicholas Kaldor in the 1960s. In his view the
capacity to generate dynamic, increasing returns and
thus greater productivity through expanded production was at the core of manufacturing.
Following this line it has been argued that manufacturing is the main driver of productivity growth.
Compared with other sectors, manufacturing provides greater opportunities to accumulate capital,
exploit economies of scale, acquire new technologies
and – more fundamentally – foster embodied and
disembodied technological change. So, not only the
level but also the dynamism of productivity is higher
in manufacturing than in other sectors and thus the
shift of resources into manufacturing entails static and
dynamic structural change bonuses (Szirmai, Naudé
and Alcorta 2013).
The dynamism of manufacturing also has key
effects on the rest of the economy. Manufacturing has
a pulling effect on other sectors arising from productive linkages. Its development stimulates, for example,
the demand for more and better primary goods (in
agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining) and services
(such as banking, insurance, communications, trade
and transport).
Manufacturing also generates externalities in technology development, skill creation and learning that

are crucial for competitiveness. For instance, manufacturing is the main vehicle for technology development and innovation (Chapter 4), representing today’s
hub for technical progress. Empirical evidence shows
that manufacturing is the sector receiving by far the
most investment in research and development (Lavopa
and Szirmai 2012). It is well established that this type
of investment has positive externalities that go far
beyond the productivity gains achieved in the same
sector, contributing widely to productivity growth
in other sectors and thus fuelling overall economic
growth. Locational externalities (agglomeration
effects – Chapter 2) arising through spillovers on the
labour market, supplier networks and other areas of
knowledge are also more likely to arise from manufacturing than from other sectors (Weiss 2013).
The above theoretical arguments are backed up
by a large body of empirical studies that has demonstrated a close positive link between economic
growth and structural change towards manufacturing. Econometric evidence from 131 developing countries in 2000–2005 suggests that economic growth is
correlated with manufacturing value-added growth
(UNIDO 2009). A more sophisticated analysis of 89
developed and developing countries in 1950–2005
found that the share of manufacturing is positively
related to economic growth and that this effect is
more pronounced for poorer countries, confirming the
“manufacturing as an engine of growth hypothesis”
(Szirmai and Verspagen 2010; Figure 1.5). The findings from these authors are in line with those reported
by Rodrik (2007), which indicate that growth accelerations are closely associated with rapid increases in
the share of manufactures in total exports or with an
increase in the share of manufacturing employment in
total employment.
A clear positive correlation is seen between the rate
of per capita growth and of the increase in manufacturing’s share in total GDP. The country groups that
achieved the fastest growth during the period are the
countries where the shift towards manufacturing has
been most intensive. China, the first Asian newly

examples. Though for a shorter period (1995–2007),
transition economies also seemed to adjust to this
pattern: they showed steep increases in their share of
manufacturing in GDP while growing very fast. At
the other extreme are country groups (mainly in Latin
America) that show exactly the opposite trend: they
deindustrialized during the period and achieved very
modest rates of GDP per capita growth.
The above analysis confirms a pattern familiar
to economic thinking and explored in the World
Economic and Social Survey 2006 (UNDESA 2006a).
For developing countries growth and development are
not about pushing the technology frontier but rather
about changing the structure of production towards
activities with higher productivity. Economies can
achieve this type of structural change by absorbing

existing technologies, producing manufacturing
goods and services for world markets and rapidly accumulating physical and human capital.
Slightly more recent empirical work also suggests
that manufacturing plays a fundamental role in sustained rapid growth. The Report of the Commission
on Growth and Development identified 13 economies
that managed to sustain very rapid growth of at least
7  percent for 25 years or more after World War II:
Botswana (1960–2005), Brazil (1950–1980), China
(1961–2005), Hong Kong SAR China (1960–1997),
Indonesia (1966–1997), Japan (1950–1983), the
Republic of Korea (1960–2001), Malaysia (1967–
1997), Malta (1963–1994), Oman (1960–1999),
Singapore (1967–2002), Taiwan Province of China
(1965–2002) and Thailand (1960–1997; World Bank
2008).
The sample is remarkably diverse, including countries from all developing regions, some rich in natural
resources, others not; some among the most populated

countries in the world, others with a population below
500,000 (World Bank 2008). Yet despite these differences, a striking fact – surprisingly not mentioned in
the report – is that all but three were driven by manufacturing industries (Figure 1.6).6
In 8 of the 13 economies manufacturing shows the
fastest growth, implying that this sector has increased
its share in total GDP over the period – that is, the
economy has shown a structural change towards
manufacturing. In Brazil and Malta manufacturing and services grew at almost the same rate, and in
only Botswana, China and Hong Kong SAR China
did manufacturing show slower growth than services.
These success stories reinforce the above argument for
the key role of manufacturing industries in sustaining
growth.

Manufacturing is the engine of growth

exercise showed that countries with natural resource
wealth follow a rather peculiar path of structural
change, we excluded from the sample the countries
richest in such resources.9 (See Effects of time, demographic and geographical conditions on manufacturing
development in Chapter 3.)
Due to space limitations, we show only specific
shares in the range of $1,000–$15,000, real purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita. Three average shares
are also presented for three groups of countries: low
and lower middle income, upper middle income and
high income.10
Based on the above share values, the ratios in
Figure 1.7 have been derived.
The relative nature of the indicators used in

which is the best direction of structural change at

as the engine of growth – its larger opportunities for
productivity gains compared with other sectors of the
economy. We analyse how the relative productivity of
each major sector (here taken to be agriculture, manufacturing, non-manufacturing industry and services)
evolves as countries develop.
Relative productivity is here simply defined as the
ratio between the output–labour ratio of each sector and that of the whole economy. This coefficient
is obtained by dividing the share of manufacturing in GDP by the share of manufacturing in total
employment.7
To get figures of this coefficient by income, we estimate the average (weighted) shares of each sector in
GDP and total employment for all countries and years
that fall in that income range (Table 1.2). In the light
of the previous evidence showing structural breaks
over the last 50 years, we restrict the analysis to the

each level of development. The higher the series, the
better the productivity gains: reallocation of resources
(labour in this case) from one sector below to another
above will lead to aggregate productivity gains.
As expected, non-manufacturing industries show
the highest relative productivity at all levels of development, mainly driven by the high capital intensity
of mining and public utilities. But the size of this
sector is limited, as is its capacity to absorb labour.
In most ranges of income the second-highest relative
productivity is achieved by manufacturing industries,
especially at GDP per capita of $2,000–$10,000 PPP,
which underlines the importance of manufacturing
in middle-income economies. And at very low income
($2,000–$4,000 PPP), the relative productivity of
manufacturing rises while that of agriculture and
services falls, revealing that manufacturing delivers
dynamic as well as static productivity gains.11
At initial stages of development, services show
extremely high relative productivity, most probably driven by non-market services such as public
26

administration, health or education. But immediately
thereafter, this coefficient drops dramatically, mainly
in line with the increase of low-productive services
such as wholesale and retail trade and personal services. Subsequently, the relative productivity of services converges to the national average.
At high incomes ($17,000 and above) in fact, the
relative productivity of the three major sectors (manufacturing, non-manufacturing industries and services)
converge to the national average. At this stage, agriculture’s share is already too small for this inter-sectoral
structural change to drive productivity, and so structural change within sectors becomes fundamental.
The key at this stage is not shifting resources further
towards manufacturing but achieving productivity
growth within manufacturing (from low- to high-tech
industries – Chapters 3 and 4). By the same token
structural change within services also becomes a leading driver of productivity growth. (As we see next,
development also entails an important structural shift
from lower productivity non-tradable services towards
higher productivity tradable services.)
Some argue that the “middle-income trap” is
fundamentally a failure to achieve this sort of structural change within sectors. Recent evidence suggests that countries that have shown rapid growth at
low incomes but are unable to move towards more
sophisticated industries or services tend to be stuck at
middle-income levels and incapable of joining the rich
nations (see, for example, Felipe, Abdon and Kumar
2012 and Lee 2013).
This subsection ends with a sectoral comparison of
relative labour productivity in which the service aggregate is opened further to disentangle – at least partially­
– its heterogeneity. The service subsectors range from
highly productive, tradable information and communications technology (ICT) professional services
to low-productive, self-subsistence, non-tradable personal services such as street vending. In particular,
we distinguish three subgroups in the International
Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 3:
tradable services, non-tradable services and non-market services.12

has the highest relative productivity while employing
a substantial number of workers. That is, manufacturing manages to combine high relative productivity
with a strong capacity to absorb labour. At the other
extreme are the largest labour-absorbing sectors, agriculture and non-tradable services, but they show much
lower relative productivity.
In a scenario such as in Figure 1.8, labour shifts
from agriculture and non-tradable services towards
manufacturing and tradable services will entail a
structural change bonus and gains in aggregate productivity – the core of the structural change pattern
described above. As countries develop, however, relative productivity across sectors tends to converge to
the national average (see Figure 1.7). The more disaggregated pattern for the restricted sample of advanced
economies confirms this pattern (Figure 1.9).
Differences in relative productivity are now almost
negligible, though the ordering of sectors is very similar to that of the 14 emerging countries’. In these
advanced economies the share of tradable services in
employment increases dramatically, even surpassing

Structural change and employment trends

But the information needed to analyse the relative productivity at such a disaggregated level within
services is unavailable in the data source used so far in
this subsection. Therefore, the analysis is restricted to
a sub-sample of 40 countries with data from the World
Input-Output Database (Timmer 2012). This database provides comparable value added and employment data by sector at the ISIC two-digit level for 14
emerging countries and 26 advanced economies.13
Figures 1.8 and 1.9 also indicate the relative size of
each sector in the whole economy, which is depicted
by the width of each bar and defined by the number of
workers of each country.
Figure 1.8 shows that in the 14 emerging economies the service aggregate disguises heterogeneous
subsectors. The most productive jobs of the economy
are in extremely modern tradable services (mainly
finance and professional activities) and – to a lesser
extent – in some non-manufacturing industries (typically capital-intensive mining or public utilities). These
sectors absorb a small (sometimes negligible) share of
workers, however. After these sectors, manufacturing

effects that in turn contribute to higher demand and
additional employment. On the supply side, by stimulating aggregate growth, especially through knowledge spillovers, manufacturing has additional impacts
on overall employment creation (Lavopa and Szirmai
2012).

Manufacturing growth and
employment
Structural change can be achieved in various ways, but
using three themes most commonly explored in the
growth-accounting literature, it is seen to be triggered
by a shift in labour from the lower to the higher productivity sector (labour-intensive structural change),
by a shift in capital (through an increase in the capital–labour ratio), or by an improvement in overall
technology (understood broadly as total factor productivity) – or a combination of all three. A cursory
look at Table 1.2 shows, for example, that the direct
absorption of workers by manufacturing is quite
limited, as its share in total employment oscillates at
10–20 percent of total employment.
Despite this, manufacturing is still fundamental to the labour market. Manufacturing jobs tend
to be more productive than others, and so tend to
be better paid and to offer better labour conditions,
such as security and employment benefits. This particular feature of manufacturing lies at the heart of
the growth-enhancing structural change argument.
Further, manufacturing’s strong productive linkages
with other sectors lead to a much greater impact on
employment creation due to indirect effects. A job in
manufacturing is typically associated with more jobs
in other sectors.
Beyond that are the “induced effects” – among the
most important means for manufacturing to stimulate
jobs – broadly defined as the external effects of investment in manufacturing other than productive linkages. These external effects take place on the demand
and supply sides. On the demand side the net increases
in incomes received by workers in jobs directly or indirectly created through investment in manufacturing
are re-spent, generating Keynesian-type multiplier

Direct jobs created in manufacturing:
formal and informal
This subsection aims to quantify the number of jobs
created in manufacturing around the world over the
last 40 years, but faces two methodological problems.
First, sector-disaggregated employment data are limited, especially in developing countries and over a long
period. Second, even when there are data, comparability among countries may be affected by different
definitions for employment status, type of occupation,
coverage and so on. Still, two main sources of information can be used: industry surveys and general household surveys.
Most countries carry out industry surveys. They
typically provide reliable data on the number of manufacturing employees working in formal enterprises
and over a long period. But depending on country they
may well cover only those firms employing at least 5
or 10 workers, and exclude self-employed workers and
unregistered employees, thus heavily underestimating
the real number of jobs created in manufacturing.
The number of manufacturing jobs can also be
estimated from household surveys (or population censuses). They generally cover all types of jobs but their
data reliability on coverage and international comparability, as well as the number of countries using them,
are much more patchy. The estimates in this subsection combine both sources to provide a picture as close
to reality as possible for manufacturing jobs (Box 1.3;
Figure 1.10).
At the beginning of the period the global formal
sector in red had around 140 million jobs, and showed
a steady increase until the end of the 1980s. After an
interruption of five years (between 1990 and 1995)
when manufacturing jobs stagnated, the series continued growing up to a peak in 2007, before the global

capture – and refers to a definition of informal that goes
far beyond unregistered jobs. In fact, many of the jobs
captured by this procedure are registered workers in small
enterprises, which are not captured in industrial surveys
as these generally include firms above 10 employees.
Because International Labour Organization data are
far weaker before 1995, we only estimate informal jobs for
1995–2009. For earlier years we extrapolate back using
the formal–informal ratio for 1995. But even within the
period with more reliable data (1995–2009), more than half
the countries are still missing. In these cases gaps have
been filled using the closest available data (in terms of
formal–informal ratio), either from the same country in a
different year or, if missing, from a different country with
similar characteristics (region or income).

Structural change and employment trends

We first calculate, for each year, the number of manufacturing jobs according to the UNIDO Database (UNIDO
2012a), which comprises data based on industry surveys
for 166 countries back to the 1960s. The jobs obtained
using this source could be generally described as formal
manufacturing jobs, because they are typically in the formal part of the economy. The estimates are then complemented with data from household surveys and population
censuses, as published in the International Labour Organization databases LABORSTA (ILO 2011a) and ILOSTAT
(ILO 2013), to calculate a rough estimate of the number of
jobs not captured by the first source.
For every country and year with data, the difference
between the two sources is calculated to give the number
of what may be termed informal manufacturing jobs. Yet
this method gives only a very rough approximation of the
true number of informal jobs – by definition very hard to

was used before that year. The estimates suggest that
focusing exclusively on formal jobs leaves out a large
(and increasing) portion of all jobs created in manufacturing. In 1995 there were some 130 million informal jobs, at around 40 percent of the total; by 2009
the figure had climbed to 187 million and the share to
48 percent. Jobs in this case involve much more than
what a traditional definition of “informal” would
contain, because workers not subject to labour legislation are included as are those working in small and
medium enterprises and the self-employed. The rise of
many emerging economies as new hubs in the world
production of manufactures (Chapter 2) is an important factor in this trend.
Taken together, formal and informal manufacturing jobs accounted for almost 388 million jobs worldwide in 2009, having grown at an average annual rate
of 1.6 percent since 1970.
Manufacturing-related jobs in services
Failure to capture informal jobs in manufacturing
is not the only way by which manufacturing jobs are
typically underestimated. Perhaps more important,
in view of the global economic transformations of the
last few decades, is the unbundling of certain production processes that statistically used to be included in
manufacturing but are now included in services.
In fact, it could be argued that the very distinction between manufacturing and services has become
blurred (Manyika et al. 2012). Not only are manufacturing firms increasingly outsourcing their non-core
operations, such as warehousing, transport, human
resource management and information technology,
but manufactured products are increasingly bundled
with a host of services and after-market functions
(such as telephone help-lines, extended warranty and
repair and retail services). Indeed, the function of
services in the manufacturing process has been sorely
neglected in historical and contemporary accounts of
economic development.
These operations partly reflect the move by companies towards a “core competence” model of organization (Prahalad and Hamel 1990). Manufacturing

30

firms have tended to shed many of their service
functions, which became separate entities in their
own right and thus appear in the national accounts
under “producer services” instead of being previously
concealed under “manufacturing” itself. These “outsourced” service firms co-produce and provide services for other manufacturing firms, thus improving
the efficiency and diffusion of service knowledge to a
wider variety of client firms.
A broader understanding of the interconnections
between manufacturing and producer services is necessary to fully assess the impact of manufacturing in
employment creation. With these interactions considered, manufacturing employment becomes more
important than often appreciated.
Take the automotive industry. Logistics and warehousing, once the preserve of the car manufacturers
themselves, have been outsourced to such an extent
that the manufacturers now fully depend on a wide
array of third-party service firms. These companies
provide the support to distribute parts and warehouse
components, transport parts and finished products to
the international market, and cope with changes in
production such as just-in-time manufacturing. And
this is before the burgeoning business of advanced car
sales operations, which provides after-market services
ranging from repair to maintenance and to purchase
finance, is taken into account.
The following section attempts to quantify the type
of manufacturing-related jobs in services just described.
Once again, the accuracy of estimates depends heavily
on data availability. Precise estimates would demand
industry- and country-specific case studies, which go
far beyond the scope of this report. Instead, a more
pragmatic approach is used, though undoubtedly less
exact and based on input-output tables at country
level. In particular, the proportion of inputs going to
manufacturing industries from different service activities are used to calculate the share of employment in
these activities that could be regarded as manufacturing-related jobs. For instance, if 20 percent of the business service industry’s output goes to manufacturing,

summed the regional figures to obtain the global total.
Since the data from this source are only from 1995, for
previous years (as previously) we extrapolated back,
applying the ratio of formal jobs to manufacturingrelated jobs of 1995 to the total formal jobs between
1970 and 1994 (Figure 1.11).
In 1995 manufacturing-related jobs in services
employed 73 million workers. Over 1995–2009 these
jobs grew much faster than those in direct formal
manufacturing (reflecting the outsourcing approaches
discussed above) reaching 95 million by 2009.
Thus manufacturing – broadly defined to include
formal, informal and manufacturing-related services–
offered almost 470  million jobs in 2009, employing around 16  percent of the world’s workforce of
2.9 billion (477 million in the peak year of 2007 over
1995–2009).16
One key message from this exercise is that any
assessment of the scale of manufacturing’s employment creation based purely on data from industry surveys will heavily undercount the true size.
Employment data from this type of source represent,
at best, half the total number of jobs directly and

as manufacturing related, thus excluding any indirect
job creation due to multiplier effects.14
For the transport and wholesale industries, we
included both the proportion of their services due
to manufacturing and their services due to receipt of
manufacturing inputs in calculating their manufacturing-related employment (for example, transport
in delivering natural resource commodities to manufacturing as well as delivering manufacturing goods
to retailers) because these services depend highly on
manufacturing activities.
The proportion of inputs used to calculate the
manufacturing-related jobs in services is taken from
the World Input-Output Database, which provides
detailed input-output data for 40 countries from six
regions between 1995 and 2009 (Timmer 2012).15
Based on this source we estimated the number of
manufacturing-related jobs created for each direct job
in manufacturing, by country and region. We then
applied the regional ratios to the total formal manufacturing jobs by region from the UNIDO database
(UNIDO 2012a) and obtained figures for the total
number of manufacturing-related jobs in services. We

indirectly created by manufacturing (and see Regional
shifts in manufacturing-related services in Chapter 2
and Manufacturing-related services employment in
Chapter 3).
Scattered evidence gathered in Lavopa and Szirmai
(2012) suggests that manufacturing is the sector with
much stronger linkages and much larger employment
multipliers in an economy: for every job created in
manufacturing, their evidence points to two or three
created outside manufacturing. This is much higher
than our estimates on manufacturing-related jobs in
services, because we intentionally calculated them
more conservatively: they include only certain sectors,
do not include second- or third-round effects (inputoutput multiplier effects) and do not include incomeinduced effects.
We can thus conclude that the real impact of manufacturing on employment creation is much higher
than portrayed in Figure 1.11.
Quality of jobs
Manufacturing jobs possess some characteristics
that make them more desirable than other types of
employment, including higher productivity from a
macroeconomic viewpoint and higher wages, better working conditions, more opportunities for skill
upgrading and many jobs for women from a social
viewpoint.
Higher productivity jobs are normally associated with higher wages. Historical evidence for the
advanced economies and the successful newly industrialized countries shows that wage gains associated
with industrializing structural change have greatly
helped pull large sections of the population out of poverty (Weiss 2013). Manufacturing is also important
for absorbing workers with modest skills and providing them with stable jobs and good benefits – as the
sector where “the world’s middle classes take shape
and grow” (Rodrik 2011).
Some employment-intensive industries seem particularly well suited for this purpose, such as garment
industries in many low-income countries (Fukunishi
et al. 2006; Fukunishi 2012; Chapter  4). These

32

industries provide wages that are generally higher,
rural opportunities with low entry barriers for less
educated workers (especially females) and a relatively
easy promotion to better positions.
Many individuals see manufacturing as a major
source of good jobs. Besides offering higher wages, it
typically provides better employee benefits and security than jobs in other sectors and tends to develop
higher skills than equivalent jobs in the rest of the
economy (Lavopa and Szirmai 2012).17
Returning to the 14 emerging economies discussed
above (see Figure  1.8), manufacturing is the largest
sector for employment, paying above-average wages
(Figure  1.12). Although mean labour incomes are
much higher in tradable services, the sector employs
only a small portion of the workforce. Non-market
services and non-manufacturing industries also pay
very good wages, but their capacity to absorb labour
is also limited. Non-tradable services and agriculture
are the main employers of the economy, but their
labour incomes are much lower than in other sectors.
Manufacturing thus possesses the advantage of being

Manufacturing is an important

source of good jobs for women

Female employment in manufacturing
Manufacturing industries can foster jobs for women:
33  percent of manufacturing workers are female, a
higher share than in agriculture (28 percent) and nonmanufacturing industries (9  percent), though lower
than in services (47 percent; Figure 1.14). In view of
manufacturing’s often better labour conditions, these
data suggest that manufacturing is an important
source of good jobs for women.

During the 1980s the female share in manufacturing rose in all regions (apart from four non-European
high-income economies). But from the mid-1990s it
started to decline in higher income economies and in
the Middle East and North Africa, though it continued growing in the lower middle- and middle-income
economies of Latin America and the Caribbean as
well as in South Asia (Table 1.3). The share remained
constant or declined from the mid-1990s in highly
export-oriented manufacturing sectors in East Asia,
including the more mature and higher income exporters (Hong Kong SAR China, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan Province of China) as well as
followers Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines (but
not Thailand).18
This East Asian “defeminization”, commented
on by many observers, is explained by technological change as part of an upgrading progress while
exporters move into technologically more sophisticated and higher value goods. This shift typically
requires higher capital–labour ratios and a higher
ratio of skilled to unskilled workers. It can be
explained either as a response to perceived demand

at the same time an important absorber of labour
while paying above-average wages.
The picture is less clear for the 26 advanced economies. Although manufacturing still pays above-­average
wages (and is second on relative labour incomes), tradable services are a larger employer that pays even better
wages (Figure 1.13).
These figures stress again the potential benefits
(in this case, wages) that arise from the movement of
labour from agriculture and non-tradable services into
manufacturing, especially at low and lower middle
incomes.

or to competition from lower wage economies.19
The link between upgrading and declining female
employment shares occurs either where female workers have less access to skill training and education or
where a form of gender discrimination exists, when
firms prefer to train or employ male workers for specific tasks.
The impact of technology on female employment
trends is ambiguous, however, as some evidence suggests that recent trends in technology-creating economies may be shifting towards greater use of female
rather than male workers on the grounds that cognitive skills are more valuable than physical skills and
that skill-intensive (typically ICT-based) technologies
may gradually increase the relative demand for female
labour. (See, for example, the analysis of the United
States labour market in Welch 2000.) How long any
such trends will take to emerge in technology-importing economies is unclear. The evidence suggests that
high export growth based on labour-intensive goods
can have a potentially strong initial effect on female
employment, but that as the export product mix
moves into more technologically sophisticated goods
this employment effect weakens.
Unlike East Asia, in South Asia (India and
Pakistan) as well as in Latin America and the
Caribbean, female employment shares continued to

rise in most countries until 2007. For South Asia the
dominant explanation seems to be that manufacturing exports stayed at modest levels of technological
sophistication, with continuing expansion of simple
labour-intensive exports. For the Latin America and
the Caribbean it was the relative lack of success of
export manufacturing because, in the context of lowproductivity growth, firms attempted to reduce costs
by replacing male workers with lower wage female
workers (Tejani and Milberg 2010). Some reasons for
these variations are grounded in the changing geography of manufacturing employment, examined in
detail in the next chapter.

defined in terms of GDP per capita at constant
2005 PPP values, a correspondence has been done
to establish thresholds that deliver the most similar classification of countries as the World Bank’s

Chapter 2

Structural transformation and
the changing geography of
manufacturing employment
As countries develop over time, the structure of their
economy (and thus employment) changes, as seen in
Chapter 1. This chapter looks at the spatial shifts in
manufacturing employment between regions and
countries, as well as within countries, stemming
from the structural transformation or change. With
developed countries becoming richer and many less
developed countries being lifted out of poverty, recent
decades have seen an important shift in the distribution of manufacturing around the globe. Although
North America, Industrialized Europe and Japan still
account for around 40 percent of global manufacturing value added, the rise of value added in East Asia
and the Pacific, particularly China, over the last few
decades has been dramatic – a shift even more prominent than in manufacturing employment (World
Bank 2013b; for a list of countries see Annex 8).
Although these trends generally confirm the prediction that the share of manufacturing should first
rise and then decline with income, other forces such as
comparative advantage also affect how quickly or slowly
structural change takes place in a given country. Trade
and comparative advantage may explain, for example,
why some high-income countries such as Germany
maintain an important manufacturing sector. The
scope of trade in shaping the geographical distribution
of manufacturing activity has become more prominent
in recent decades with the entry of some important
middle-income countries such as China and the Russian
Federation into the World Trade Organization, and the
increasing fragmentation of the value chain.
As relative productivity is an important driver of
specialization and trade, agglomeration economies are
important in explaining how manufacturing locates
across space. The emergence of some countries like
China, the Republic of Korea and Singapore as manufacturing hubs is related to agglomeration economies at
the country level. Yet this type of spatial clustering is
usually more prominent within countries, because some
forces that encourage geographical concentration are

much stronger at the small geographical scale of regions,
cities or towns than at the large geographical scale of
countries. Within the United States, for instance, the
Midwest used to be an important manufacturing region
before turning into a “Rust Belt” and being replaced
by other regional clusters, such as China’s eastern seaboard. (Not all of China is becoming a factory; many of
its regions remain based on agriculture.)
When looking within countries, manufacturing
tends to become geographically more concentrated
during the structural change from agriculture to
manufacturing, but the trend reverses when services
become more important, for two main reasons. First,
agriculture is land intensive, but this is less true of
manufacturing and even less so of services. So when
manufacturing replaces agriculture, manufacturing tends to cluster, but when services become more
important manufacturing tends to disperse.
Second, the structural change is driven partly
by productivity gains and innovation. In the early
stages of industrialization, when there are high gains
from knowledge clusters, manufacturing concentrates. Later, as manufacturing matures, those gains
become smaller, and it often moves to areas where
land is cheaper. For example, in the last half century
in advanced economies such as the United States and
Western Europe, manufacturing has been relocating
to less congested areas, making it geographically more
dispersed. In less advanced economies this is less true,
and manufacturing continues to have a strong presence in urban areas. There is thus a link between a
country’s level of development and the geographical
concentration of its manufacturing.
The overall trend of manufacturing to move to less
congested areas in advanced economies needs to be
qualified in three ways. First, although manufacturing
firms are moving out of cities, they are “suburbanizing”
rather than “ruralizing”. They still have a strong motive
to stay quite close to cities. Second, not all manufacturing subsectors are moving out of cities – the cost
37

Structural transformation and the changing geography of manufacturing employment

of remoteness is greater in high-tech than in low-tech
manufacturing. Third, the increasing fragmentation
of the value chain implies that specialization is becoming more functional than sectoral. This fragmentation
allows the more complex parts of manufacturing to
remain in cities and the more routine-like parts to relocate to cheaper places. Once again, cities remain attractive for the knowledge-intensive part of manufacturing.
Of course, it is not only economic development
that leads to spatial concentration or urbanization –
the opposite is true as well. Cities are laboratories for
learning and knowledge creation. Wages are higher in
urban environments because people are more productive. And the longer people stay in cities, the more productive they become. The highly interactive environment stimulates knowledge acquisition – most young,
innovative firms are in dense economic clusters and a
disproportionate share of patents is generated in cities.
All of this leads to a self-reinforcing process in which
economic development leads to urbanization, and
urbanization leads to economic development.
But urbanization does not only have to do with
productivity. People may also prefer living in cities
because they enjoy the amenities there, and in some

African countries, for example, we are witnessing rising urbanization without a structural transformation.
This reflects cities being not just production centres
but also consumption centres.
Shifts in manufacturing employment
between regions and countries
One region has been the big winner in the employment shifts in direct manufacturing, based on the
“traditional” approach to counting jobs in the sector
– East Asia and the Pacific.1 But the view for jobs in
manufacturing-related services is more nuanced.
Shifts between regions in direct
manufacturing
In Industrializing Europe, which includes transition
economies, formal manufacturing jobs fell by more
than half from about 33 million in 1970 to 7 million
in 2010 (Figure  2.1). Industrialized Europe shows
a less dramatic rate of decrease in the period, from
40 million to 31 million. In North America the drop
was similar, from nearly 20 million to 14 million.
Countries in East Asia and the Pacific are the big
winners (Box  2.1): they gained around 66  million

South and Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean (Box Figure 2). The phasing out of the Multifibre
Arrangement (replaced in 1995 by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Textiles and Clothing) intensified the
shift.
The reasons for the shift between the two industries
differ – mainly the drive to conquer large emerging markets in the automotive industry (see Chapter 3) and cheap
labour in textiles and apparel (Staritz 2011).
For both, most higher value activities like product
development, design and branding have stayed put. This
may change in the coming years, however, in response
to a growing tendency for the more complex activities to
move to emerging markets as they upgrade their skills and
technology. Automotive multinationals, for instance, have
been allowed to set up design and engineering centres
in China on the condition of technology sharing and can
thus comply better with local customer requirements (in
line with different preferences and purchasing conditions).
In textiles and apparel the Indian industry is increasingly
carrying out original design manufacturing – that is, it is
covering all steps involved in production, including design,
purchasing, cutting, sewing, trimming, packing and distributing (Frederick and Gereffi 2010).

Structural transformation and the changing geography of manufacturing employment

Two major global employers – automotive (high-tech) and
textiles and apparel (low-tech) – show similar geographical
shifts to Asia in manufacturing jobs, though at a different
pace and for different reasons.
The automotive industry, which here covers the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers as well
as of other transport equipment (34+35 ISIC Revision 3), is
still strongly represented in industrialized countries, having shifted fewer jobs to developing regions (Box Figure 1),
though the trend to low-cost countries is picking up. In
absolute terms North America and Industrialized Europe
are still generating a good many automotive jobs but
relatively are losing to countries such as China and India,
which show rapidly rising employment.
The textile and apparel industry is the more labour
intensive, tradable and easily accessible of the two due
to its low entry costs and simple production technology,
which has led to a more dramatic employment shift. (The
industry refers here to the manufacture of textiles as well
as the manufacture of apparel, and dressing and dyeing of
fur – 17+18 ISIC Revision 3.) Jobs had already moved from
North America and Industrialized Europe to Japan in the
1950s; in later decades the shift continued to low-income
countries, notably those in East Asia and the Pacific,

Shifts between countries in direct
manufacturing
This subsection looks at the data at a more disaggregated level. The top 10 countries by share of global formal manufacturing jobs accounted for around 70 percent of the total throughout the period, though this
fairly constant share masks underlying geographical
shifts (Table 2.1).
China, which replaced the Soviet Union at the top
in 1990 and kept that spot in 2010, increased its share
hugely, from 10 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 2010,
for an increase of about 55 million formal jobs. India
moved up from eighth in 1970 to third in 2010, nearly
doubling its share to 6 percent by adding about 7 million formal jobs. Brazil, which started at number 13
in 1970, moved into the top five by 2010, having more
than doubled its share from 1.5  percent to 4.0  percent, and increased jobs by about 5.6 million.3 Other
countries moving into the top 10 include Bangladesh,
Indonesia and Viet Nam.
In the other direction, France, Germany, Japan,
Italy, Poland, the Russian Federation and the United
Kingdom fell within or even out of their top 10 slots.
The Russian Federation, for example, lost nearly
23 million formal manufacturing jobs between 1991
and 2010 (given the break-up of the Soviet Union any
comparison with 1970 would be meaningless), and
by 2010 had only around 8 million formal workers in
manufacturing. Its global share dropped from 11 percent to 4 percent in this period. The United Kingdom
lost around 5.7  million formal manufacturing jobs
between 1970 and 2010 (its share falling from 6 percent to only 1 percent), and Japan gave up 3.6 million
(losing half its share, from 8  percent to 4  percent).
The losses in France, Germany and Poland were more
modest. The United States continued to hold second position but still lost nearly 5.5  million formal

manufacturing jobs as its share fell by more than half
from 13 percent in 1970 to 6 percent in 2010.
Regional shifts in manufacturing-related
services
The positive impact of manufacturing on output
and employment in services has increased in recent
decades, especially in industrialized countries. This
greater service intensity of manufacturing stems
from greater demand for coordination across locations (because of outsourcing, for example) and from
changes in technology and organization (Falk and
Jarocinska 2010). If we thus take a broader view of
manufacturing and include manufacturing-related
services, the decline of manufacturing in industrialized countries is mitigated somewhat, as will be shown
below. Table 2.2 shows that manufacturing-related
services have seven subcategories.
Based on the typology of services that identifies
their relation to manufacturing, renting of machinery
and equipment and other business activities (ISIC:
71–74) – or business services for short – seems to be
most closely linked to manufacturing production, followed by trade, financial intermediation and transport and inland transport (ISIC: 51, J, 52, 60) with a
medium linkage to manufacturing. Real estate activities, post and telecommunications, other supporting
and auxiliary transport activities as well as sale, maintenance and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles
(ISIC: 70, 63, 64, 50) show a low linkage to manufacturing, whereas hotels and restaurants as well as air
and water transport (ISIC: H, 62, 61) show the lowest
linkage.4
Manufacturing-related services still play an important role in industrialized countries (Figure 2.2):
their jobs remained stable at around 32 million during 1995–2009. Business services especially, such as
design, research, engineering, branding, advertising
and marketing, are still increasing and mitigate the
decline of manufacturing employment in industrialized countries. Looking at the share of employment in
manufacturing-related services, industrialized economies have increased their share from 24  percent in

1995 to 29 percent in 2009 (of total manufacturing
and manufacturing-related services employment).
Within the same period (1995–2009), the industrializing countries show a strong increase from nearly
34  million to around 51  million manufacturingrelated services jobs (see Figure 2.2). East Asia and the
Pacific, especially China, is the “power region” within
the industrializing countries, as their manufacturingrelated services jobs increased from nearly 24 million
jobs in 1995 to more than 31 million jobs in 2009 (see
Figure 2.2). The region showed strong gains in all categories (except financial intermediation), notably in
business services and transport. Increasing transport
could also be linked to rising intra-regional trade and
the increasing participation of regional countries in
international production sharing.
Although growth of direct manufacturing
employment in Latin America and the Caribbean
is not as pronounced as in some other regions, particularly Asia, the growth in manufacturing-related
services employment there has been quite dynamic,
possibly because it uses such employment more for
manufacturing production than other regions (see
Figure 2.2). Business services, wholesale, transport
and financial intermediation made strong gains during 1995–2009.

Overall, regional employment growth patterns in
manufacturing-related services confirm that manufacturing and manufacturing-related activities are shifting geographically to Asia, particularly to East Asia
and the Pacific. At the same time, however, business
services in Industrialized Europe and North America
have stayed fairly stable, mitigating a little the drop
in direct manufacturing jobs in those regions (see
Figure 2.2).
Shifts among regions and countries in
manufacturing trade
The evolution of net manufactured exports among
regions and over time confirms the broad employment
patterns presented above. (The relationship between
manufacturing trade and employment is considered
in greater detail in Chapter 5.) Over 1970–2011 net
manufactured exports of East Asia and the Pacific
soared from $2  billion to $653  billion (Figure  2.3).
Another region that saw dramatic gains was
Industrialized Europe (from $14 billion to $359 billion). But North America saw the balance of its net
manufactured exports crash from a positive $4  billion to a $814 billion deficit. Industrializing Europe,
Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East
and North Africa, South and Central Asia and SubSaharan Africa also recorded widening net deficits,
though less dramatically.
These trends not only reflect structural transformation and changing comparative advantage but also
changing trade balances, and so have to be interpreted
with caution. Regions that were running increasing trade surpluses, such as East Asia and the Pacific,
may be increasing net exports in general and not just
in manufacturing. Similarly, regions with widening
trade deficits may see decreasing net exports across the
board.
Changes in the country distribution of manufactured exports have been largely led by China, which
moved from 12th place in 1990 to the top spot in
2011, vastly increasing its net manufactured exports
from nearly $1  billion to $604  billion (Table  2.3).
Again, this reflects not only China’s emergence as

a manufacturing powerhouse but also its widening
trade surplus with the rest of the world.
Strong increases in net manufactured exports are
also displayed by Thailand and some high-income
countries, such as Germany, Japan and the Republic
of Korea, and to a lesser extent by Italy and the
Netherlands. These are all countries whose pace of
structural change out of manufacturing and into
services has been slower than expected given their
GDP, probably still retaining some advantage in

manufacturing and thus allowing them to maintain
a strong manufacturing export sector. Some of these
countries, such as Germany and Japan, have thus suffered smaller losses in manufacturing employment
than other countries with similar incomes.

Industrialized Europe has the expected picture of
a small trade deficit in low-tech net exports in 2011
and a large surplus in resource-based (mainly due to
Russia’s high surplus), medium- and high-tech net

Shifts in the global structure of production
and trade through global value chains
The geographical shift in manufactured exports has
been boosted by the worldwide fragmentation of production, increasingly organized along global value
chains (GVCs) and global production networks.5
A value chain can be thought of as the “full range of
activities that firms and workers do to bring a product

from its conception to its end use and beyond” (Gereffi
and Fernandez-Stark 2011, p. 4). Different tasks, such
as product design and development, production, and
marketing and distribution, are carried out in different
countries that, rather than specialize in different final
goods, specialize in different tasks or stages of the production process (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg 2008).
The rise of GVCs and the global pattern of production is readily seen in trade in intermediate goods,
a widely used indicator of participation in GVCs.
Such trade accounted for half of global trade in 2011,
reflecting an increase over 1970–2011 from around
$152  billion to $6,922  billion, or nearly 10  percent
annually (Figure 2.5).
By region the shares of Industrialized Europe and
North America declined by 25 percentage points during 1970–2011 (Figure 2.6). The share of East Asia

and the Pacific increased – reflecting rising manufacturing capacity and related trade in intermediates –
from 13 percent in 1970 to 35 percent in 2011.
The more pronounced role of Asia in global manufacturing production and trade is largely driven by

China (Figure 2.7). China, the largest exporter and
importer of intermediate goods in Asia, shows very
high growth rates, far above the regional average,
both for exports (with the Republic of Korea) and for
imports (with Hong Kong SAR China and India).
Shifts in manufacturing employment
within countries
The structural change leads to shifts in manufacturing
activity not only between regions and countries but
also within countries.
Structural change and geographical
concentration
According to Marshall (1920), agglomeration economies have three possible sources. First, information
and knowledge are more easily transmitted at short
distances. These localized knowledge spillovers make
it more attractive for firms to locate close to each
other. Second, the geographical concentration of
industry generates a localized market for specialized
skills. This labour-market pooling gives further incentives to firms to locate near each other. Third, the spatial clustering of a particular industry creates a market for specialized suppliers, which in turn increases
the productivity of all the cluster’s firms. These three

centripetal forces generally work simultaneously when
industries cluster.
During the structural change out of agriculture,
manufacturing tends to become geographically more
concentrated. In advanced economies services are now
replacing manufacturing in urban areas as industrial
production plants move out to less congested areas. So
to analyse the relation between structural change and
geographical concentration in countries, we need to
look at manufacturing and services together, because
both are associated with increases in urbanization.
Urbanization as proxy
With urbanization as a proxy for geographical concentration, the relation between the non-agricultural
employment share and the degree of urbanization is
positive and linear (Figure 2.8). 6 On a linear regression the slope is equal to 0.8. This implies that a 1 percentage point increase in the share of manufacturing
and service employment is associated with a 0.8 percentage point increase in urbanization. Thus, there is a
strong positive correlation between structural change
and urbanization.

If we focus exclusively on the share of manufacturing, the relation with urbanization has an inverted U
shape (Figure  2.9). Countries with intermediate
levels of manufacturing employment have the highest urbanization: these correspond to the advanced
economies in which the structural change into services has led to a decrease in the share of manufacturing employment. Countries with low or high shares
of manufacturing employment are less urbanized, but
the effect is not symmetric: the least urbanized have
the lowest shares of manufacturing, and are usually
the countries still heavily based on agriculture.
Rather than comparing the degree of geographical concentration in different countries at different
stages of their structural change, we can also follow a
country over time. The prediction is that as a country
moves through its first and second transformations,
the degree of geographical concentration increases.

greater spatial concentration of economic activity

Geographical concentration in different
industries
Manufacturing and services
As innovation is a particularly important driver of
the spatial concentration of economic activity, the
tendency towards clustering is stronger in sectors that
benefit more from innovation. Recent evidence for the
United States, for example, shows that services, which
benefit more than manufacturing from information

and communication technologies (ICTs; Hobijn and
Jovanovic 2001), have become more concentrated in
the past few decades, unlike more mature industries,
which have become increasingly dispersed (Table 2.4
and Box 2.2).
For example, in 1970 a county in the United States
at the 70th percentile had 81 percent more manufacturing employment than a county at the 30th percentile, but by 2000 this difference had fallen to 74 percent, suggesting that manufacturing employment was
becoming increasingly dispersed in the United States.
But in services the difference between the counties at
the 70th and 30th percentiles rose from 29 percent
to 52 percent, indicating that services were becoming
more concentrated. Thus although manufacturing is
still more concentrated than the various service industries, the difference is narrowing (Desmet and RossiHansberg forthcoming).
Producer-related services
The increased spatial dispersion of manufacturing is
less dramatic when we account for “producer-related
services”, such as wholesale, retail, and finance,

out at 0.57, 0.43 and 0.14, respectively (meaning that
Pakistan, for example, produces 80 percent of its GDP
on 57 percent of its land).
Given the evidence on structural change and
urbanization presented earlier, we would expect the
relation between structural change and geographical
dispersion of GDP to be negative, which is indeed the
case (Figure 2.10).8 Countries with a larger share of
manufacturing and services in value added are geographically less dispersed. The structural change is
thus associated with greater spatial concentration of
economic activity.

insurance and real estate (FIRE), which are important
partly because of demand from manufacturing. These
services included, it is no longer true that all activity

(in the United States at least) is moving to less congested areas (Table 2.5).
Manufacturing employment: patterns of
dispersion
As economic activity becomes more clustered, land
rents increase, giving rise to congestion costs. This
caps the size of geographical clusters and cities. The
incentive to locate in cities and other high-density
locations thus depends on the strength of agglomeration economies and the importance of congestion
costs.
In advanced economies, as seen, agglomeration
forces in manufacturing have become weaker, giving
an incentive to manufacturing firms to move out of
cities to cheaper areas – “suburbanizing”. But in less

Box 2.2	
The dynamo and the computer
The title of this box draws on the work of David (1990),
which compared the many similarities between electricity
and ICT. Electrification in the early 20th century spawned
important productivity gains and innovation in manufacturing, whereas ICT in the late part of the century proportionately benefited services. As the incentive to geographically cluster is greater in highly innovative sectors,
we would thus expect a tendency towards spatial concentration in manufacturing in the early 20th century and in
services in the late 20th century.
And this is exactly what we do see. For the United
States in 1900–1920 manufacturing’s spatial growth
pattern is almost identical to that of services in recent
decades – and very different from that of manufacturing today (Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg 2009). Focusing on medium-size locations, the upward-sloping curve
for manufacturing in 1900 –1920 and for services in
1970–2000 suggests a tendency towards greater geographical concentration: larger locations grow faster
than smaller locations (Box Figure 1). In more mature
industries, such as manufacturing in 1970–2000, the
incentive to cluster is much weaker. Thus we see spatial
dispersion, as larger locations grow more slowly than
smaller locations.
The US wholesale sector exhibits similar behaviour to
that of manufacturing: it is becoming more dispersed. In
contrast, retail and FIRE are becoming spatially more concentrated. In FIRE, a sector closely connected to ICT, the

difference in employment between the county at the 70th
percentile and that at the 30th increased from 38 percent
in 1970 to 48  percent in 2000, indicating an increase in
geographical concentration.

developed economies this is less true, as they are not as
far along in the process of structural change.
Suburbanizing manufacturing jobs
in advanced economies
In the United States and other advanced economies
manufacturing has been relocating to less expensive
places, giving rise to geographical dispersion. This is
related to manufacturing becoming a more mature
activity, so that learning spillovers and agglomeration
economies have become less important.
But it does not mean that manufacturing is moving to the “middle of nowhere”. Data for United States
counties for 1972–2000 suggest that manufacturing employment growth was slower in manufacturing clusters but higher in areas 40–50 kilometres
away (Desmet and Fafchamps 2005). Manufacturing
employment growth was also lower in areas with high
employment in general (not just in manufacturing),
and higher in areas 40–60 kilometres away. The finding that manufacturing firms are moving out of clusters but staying relatively close to them suggests that
a cost of remoteness remains. One would expect this
cost to be especially important for manufacturing subsectors that benefit most from knowledge spillovers.
And indeed, Fallah and Partridge (2012) find
that remoteness is particularly costly in high-tech

Geographical concentration of employment
growth in developing countries
In advanced economies growth in innovative sectors is
typically concentrated in medium–high-density locations. The evidence is more mixed for many developing
countries. In some developing countries growth is concentrated in the largest, densest cities, while in others
the picture is closer to that in the United States. Box 2.3
focuses on the world’s largest two developing countries,
India and China, and examines what is the case there.

activities. Their results show that being close to highdensity locations benefits employment growth in general, but more so for high-tech sectors. Arauzo-Carod
and Viladecans-Marsal (2009) find similar results for
Spain. In a study of new entrants over 1992–1996,
they estimate that in high-tech manufacturing
47.3 percent of new entrants located in the central city.
In contrast, in intermediate- and low-tech manufacturing a lower 31.9 percent and 30.2 percent did. The
fact that remoteness remains costly, and more so for
high-tech sectors, is consistent with the link between
the age of an industry and its geographical concentration. For highly innovative young industries there are
powerful reasons to cluster, as knowledge spillovers
are an important driver of a firm’s performance in
those industries.

Cities as centres of consumption – and
learning
As shown above, the geographical distribution of
employment is closely correlated with the geographical distribution of population. If firms have an incentive to set up in cities, people follow. But sometimes
jobs follow people. Many people prefer living in an
urban environment because they enjoy the consumption amenities these environments offer. Evidence
from the United States shows that population growth
has been increasingly concentrating in cities with
good weather, proximity to water and a wide range of
cultural services (Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz 2001). Fastrising urbanization in many African countries, often
in the absence of structural change, points in the same

employment in 2000. In contrast to India, the highest density cities grow somewhat more slowly than the mediumdensity cities, including Shanghai and Shantou. These
findings are consistent with Au and Henderson (2006)
who find that some of the larger prefecture-­level cities are
increasingly turning towards services.
What is striking is that when we compare China and
India, agglomeration economies are strongest in China at
an employment density of around 3.5 in log terms (about
30 employees per square kilometre), similar to the employment density for which agglomeration economies are
weakest in India. In that sense manufacturing in China
looks more like that in the United States in the early 20th
century, but manufacturing in India looks very different.
This suggests that certain barriers are preventing India’s
medium-density locations from growing faster – one may
be poor access to infrastructure.

For Indian districts, Box Figure 1 plots annual employment growth in manufacturing between 2000 and 2005 as
a function of initial manufacturing employment density in
2000. Although there is much heterogeneity among districts, what stands out is that medium-density locations
are predicted to grow less than high-density locations.
Some of the densest districts, such as Kolkata, with a
manufacturing employment density of more than 1,000
employees per square kilometre, continue to grow surprisingly fast. This picture differs from what we would expect,
given the US experience when it went through its structural change out of agriculture.
India’s experience cannot, however, be generalized
to all developing countries. The corresponding chart for
China (Box Figure  2) shows prefecture-level cities and

observe similar patterns for formal manufacturing employment, except in Industrialized Europe.
While this region was characterized by a slight
increase of formal manufacturing jobs over 1990–
2010, the informal jobs decreased slightly over
1995–2009. Among the top three rankings of
informal manufacturing employment, East Asia
and the Pacific holds first position in 2009 with
59.8  million informal manufacturing jobs, followed by South and Central Asia with 56.7 million and Latin America and the Caribbean with
40.3 million.
Brazil almost doubled its formal manufacturing
jobs over 1990–2010. This sharp rise could be a
result of two subsequent reclassifications from
ISIC Rev. 2 to ISIC Rev. 3 (1990–1995) and from
ISIC Rev. 4 to ISIC Rev. 3 (2008–2010). Between
1996 and 2007 the employment figures were
reported in ISIC Rev. 3. Further, the number of
establishments reporting relevant figures rose
from 6,094,000 in 1990 to 29,368,000 in 2010
establishments.
The thresholds are established based on the average backward linkage coefficient calculated using
input-output techniques on the World InputOutput Database (Timmer 2012). The thresholds are the following: high-coefficients – higher
than 0.1; medium – between 0.05 and 0.1; low
– between 0.01 and 0.05; and very low – coefficients lower than 0.01.
In line with Shepherd and Stone (2013, p. 4),
“the concept of GVCs is closely related to those
of global production networks”. The main difference is that the GVC concept is inherently
non-linear, as it is based on complex network
interactions.
Urbanization measures the share of the population living in urban areas. The positive correlation between non-agricultural employment and
urbanization may be partly driven by the definition of urbanization, which in some countries
is related to the relative absence of primary sector employment. For a complete definition of

city also earns more than someone similar who did not
spend time in a large city. This suggests that big cities
allow workers to accumulate valuable experience and
knowledge that they can take with them when they
move away (Glaeser and Mare 2001). In principle this
could simply be due to positive sorting: larger cities
may attract workers who are already more productive
in the first place.
De la Roca and Puga (2012), however, by following
workers over their life time, control for such sorting
and still find a positive effect of large cities on learning. In a study of Spain they show that someone who
has spent 10 years working in Madrid (the country’s
largest city) and then moves to Santiago (the country’s median city by size) continues to earn on average 13 percent more for the rest of their working life
than someone who never left Santiago. A similar finding holds for someone who spends 10 years in Seville
(one of the country’s medium–large cities) rather than
Madrid, and then moves to Santiago, although as
expected the effect is smaller.
Whatever the reason – whether firms are looking for knowledge spillovers in dense urban environments, whether people are attracted by urban amenities, or whether workers go to large cities in search of
experience and learning – urbanization is continuing,
with more and more mega-cities appearing around the
world.
Many policy-makers wonder whether these megacities are becoming too large, yet evidence from
Au and Henderson (2006) and Desmet and RossiHansberg (2013) point to the contrary. In China, for
example, there may be further welfare gains from having more spatial concentration of economic activity in
large cities. So, despite the many problems associated
with cities, such as congestion and pollution, there are
powerful reasons for people to continue flocking to
them.

Chapter 3

Structural change in manufacturing

Building on the discussion of the overall economic
structural change in the previous chapters, this chapter
illustrates structural change within manufacturing in
detail. It shows that at relatively low incomes manufacturing value added, productivity and employment tend
to grow fast. Then, as countries achieve higher incomes,
manufacturing employment slows because its major
sources (labour-intensive, low-tech industries) start
curtailing employment. This slowdown and eventual
decline in employment usually occur while manufacturing value added and productivity keeps increasing.
At an advanced stage of industrialization, industries with a higher technological level grow faster
than others, and some of them could sustain their fast
growth of value added even at very high GDP per capita. But such industries with high growth potential are
usually more capital and technology intensive, and in
terms of employment each one of those industries will
create a fraction of the jobs of a labour-intensive industry. Unlike value added, most manufacturing industries start reducing employment before the economy
reaches $25,000 GDP per capita (at 2005 purchasing
power parity dollars).
Still, as countries develop, manufacturing’s potential to create employment in manufacturing-related
services increases. Thus even in industrialized countries, manufacturing makes a bigger contribution to
employment than the direct manufacturing statistics
might indicate. Most of those service jobs pay wages
comparable to those in manufacturing.
Although this relationship between income and
manufacturing structure has some elements of universality since countries more or less follow a similar path
of structural change as income rises, comparable to
structural change for the whole economy (Chapter 1),
country-specific conditions are important: geographical and demographic conditions give countries natural advantages or disadvantages in developing certain
industries (Katz 2000). There is also space for countries to shape the structure autonomously, which is

why history, culture and policy also matter to a country’s development (Lin and Chang 2009).
Three labour-intensive industries – wearing apparel,
textiles, and food and beverages – are particularly
important for industrialization to take off. They create
a large number of formal, better paid jobs in manufacturing, absorbing the unemployed and underemployed
rural workforce from less productive activities. Later,
the manufacturing structure needs to be continually
upgraded, and if that is successful, entry into more technology- and knowledge-intensive industries could both
compensate for the decline in jobs in labour-intensive
industries and enhance the quality of manufacturing
jobs. Medium-tech industries perform a bridging role
for industrialization: although their employment generation capacity is not as large as labour-intensive industries, they are crucial for generating investment goods
and funds for further industrial upgrading. While each
higher tech industry does not usually create as many
jobs as a labour-intensive one, the successful development of the multiple higher tech industries could
enhance the skills, technology and knowledge base of a
country’s manufacturing sector, leading to higher manufacturing productivity and wages.
Manufacturing development in low- and middleincome countries could also improve women’s social
and economic status as labour-intensive manufacturing industries often employ more female than male
workers. But their continuing concentration in these
industries works against the sustained gains in women’s economic welfare when manufacturing becomes
more technology intensive.

Structural change in manufacturing

and economic development. The value added and
employment data are available at the manufacturing subsector level for 1963 and 1998 for four countries from different regions – Colombia, Hungary,
Kenya and the Republic of Korea. In 1963 the GDP
per capita of Kenya and the Republic of Korea were
about the same and the lowest among the four.
Hungary and Colombia had 3.7 times and 1.7
times higher GDP per capita than the other two,
respectively.
After 35 years the country that changed its structure the most also increased its GDP per capita the
most: the Republic of Korea completely transformed
its manufacturing structure from low- to high-tech
industries and increased GDP per capita eight times,
transforming itself from one of the poorest to the
richest of the four (Figure 3.1). Over the same period
Kenya did not change its manufacturing structure
much – nor its GDP per capita.
Hungary already had fairly high value-added
shares in low/medium and high-tech industries
as well as a high GDP per capita in 1963 (see
Figure  3.1). Over the 35 years it further increased
the share of higher tech industries but not to the
same degree as the Republic of Korea, and experienced a slower increase in GDP per capita. Finally,
Colombia increased the shares of some medium-tech
industries and chemicals but not the shares of other
high-tech industries, and it only doubled its GDP
per capita.
While country-specific conditions might make a
difference as to which industries within different technology groups develop more than others, such differences do not seem to override the relationship between
the shift in the overall manufacturing structure and
economic development.
The speed of development
If the transformation of the manufacturing structure
has a strong association with a country’s economic
development, the speed of exploiting the advantage
in existing industries and laying the foundation for
emerging industries through investment becomes key

56

for fast economic growth. To illustrate, Figure 3.2
shows the estimated development patterns of industries in value added per capita (food and beverages,
wearing apparel, basic metals, and electrical machinery and apparatus) and the actual development paths
of the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Sri Lanka
(Box 3.1).
The three countries have advantages in different
industries that reflect their stage of development. Sri
Lanka’s is in relatively labour-intensive industries,
such as food and beverages and wearing apparel, and
thus rapid growth in these industries is foreseen.
Malaysia has already lost its advantage in these industries, but can still expect continuing growth for some
time in basic metals as well as long-term growth in
electrical machinery and apparatus. The Republic of
Korea has already lost, or is about to lose, its advantage in basic metals, but should keep its advantage in
electrical machinery and apparatus for the foreseeable
future.
Despite similar development trajectories, the
speeds at which these three countries have exploited
their advantages – and thus increased their income
and, possibly, shifted their advantage from one industry to another – differ (Table 3.1). All four industries
developed much faster in the Republic of Korea than
in Malaysia even during a similar stage of economic
development: in wearing apparel around 20 times
faster, and in basic metals and in electrical machinery
and apparatus about 10 times faster. Sri Lanka’s industries lagged behind Malaysia’s, apart from wearing
apparel.
Productivity increases are crucial in accelerating development. The higher the growth of labour
productivity, the faster a country moves along the
development trajectories (Haraguchi 2012; Annex 1).
Productivity growth is especially important in
explaining the speed of transformation of high-tech
industries; productivity and other factors, such as
wages, may be associated with the growth of low-tech
industries (Chapter 4).
The Republic of Korea has experienced a fast
manufacturing transformation in pursuit of raising

patterns, the same ratio was calculated for the country
(Box Figure 1) alongside Hoffmann’s results.
The Republic of Korea transformed its manufacturing
structure much faster than early industrialized countries,
as seen in its steeper downward slope. It took around 40
years for the United Kingdom and 30 years for Germany
and Japan to reduce the ratio from two to one, but the
Republic of Korea only 15. The country has had the fastest
structural change of manufacturing among countries with
time-series data in the last 50 years.
Other countries vary (Box Figure 2). China seems to
match the Republic of Korea while others have industrialized slowly, seen little structural change and increased
the weight of consumer-goods industries rather than
industrial-­goods industries.

Structural change in manufacturing

Hoffmann (1958) identified the periods in which various
countries reached different stages of industrialization
based on the ratio of value added of consumer-goods
industries (food, drink and tobacco, clothing including
footwear, leather goods and furniture) to capital-goods
industries (ferrous and non-ferrous metals, machinery, vehicle building and chemicals). His study showed
a gradual but steady decline of the ratio in the United
Kingdom and the United States and a faster decline
of the ratio in Germany and Japan as industrialization
progressed.
The study went up only to 1960 and so did not
include the Republic of Korea. To put that case in historical perspective and compare it with past industrialization

effects of a country’s specific conditions.1
Development of manufacturing industries
with different technology levels
Sustained economic growth entails structural change
at a disaggregated level within manufacturing through

technological upgrading and diversification, and then
possibly specialization later (Imbs and Wacziarg
2003). Based on three technology groups in manufacturing industries, countries generally have a high
share of low-tech industries at low incomes (Table
3.2). As countries increase their GDP per capita, that
share rapidly declines while the shares of medium-tech

Note: Shaded rows represent the manufacturing industries analysed. The three groups follow the technology classification of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
based on research and development (R&D) intensity relative to value added and gross production statistics. The OECD classifies manufacturing industries into four categories of high-tech, mediumhigh-tech, medium-low-tech and low-tech industries. In this report high-tech and medium-high-tech industries are combined and called high-tech industries, and medium-low-tech industry is
called medium-tech industry. The classification reflects the average R&D intensity of industries, so there might be products of different R&D intensity in each technology category.

(mostly capital-intensive, resource-processing industry) and high-tech (mostly capital- and technologyintensive industry) groups increase (Figure 3.3).
Although the medium-tech industries have a higher
value-added share than high-tech industries at low
income, the share of the former increases only slowly
and hits the peak before reaching $20,000 GDP per
capita. Then, only high-tech industries increase the
value-added share at the expense of the shares of lowand medium-tech industries.
To investigate the details of manufacturing development underlying the above structural change, the following analysis looks at the changes in the levels of the
development of 10 out of 18 manufacturing industries at
60

the two-digit level of International Standard Industrial
Classification Revision 3 (Box 3.3). For this analysis,
value added per capita and employment–population
ratio are used because, unlike shares, they are not influenced by the ups and downs of other industries and so
are better able to expose industrial characteristics (such
as growth rates).2 The 10 industries are representative
of manufacturing as a whole, comprising industries of
different technological content and stages of development. The 10 industries usually account for more than
75 percent of value added and employment in manufacturing. They include three low-tech, three medium-tech
and four high-tech industries with different degrees of
labour intensity (Annex 2).

A note on data

Manufacturing
Most figures in this chapter have been produced based
on the UNIDO Industry Statistics Database at the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision
3 for the estimations of manufacturing development patterns (UNIDO 2012a). The dataset has unbalanced data on
employment and value added for 23 manufacturing industries at the ISIC two-digit level for 1963–2007.
The 23 industries were consolidated into 18 industries
because many countries reported some of the industries
together – often grouping ISIC 18 and 19; 29 and 30; 31
and 32; and 34 and 35. To make the structural change
analysis consistent and reliable, these pairs were combined and indicated by the first industry of each pair (such

as 18 for the combined 18 and 19) for the combined industry throughout this chapter.
The maximum number of 74 countries for value added
and 95 countries for employment are included for the
estimations. The Index of Industrial Production is used to
approximate real value added per capita, and fixed effects
are applied to the regression analysis.

Income groups
The income levels that divide countries into low and lower
middle, upper middle and high income are based on the
definition in Chapter 1.

Within these general patterns, different industries
have distinct patterns of development owing to differences in technological level and speed of technological
change. The following discussion looks at three groups
of industries classified by broad technology characteristics: labour-intensive, low-tech industries; mediumtech industries; and high-tech industries.
Labour-intensive, low-tech industries
Among the 10 industries selected, food and beverages, textiles, and wearing apparel belong to this category. 3 These three industries, relating to humans’
basic necessities, are distinguished by their higher
levels of value added at relatively low incomes, as seen
in Figure 3.6 (which magnifies the development patterns at low and lower middle incomes in Figure 3.4).
Due to their labour-intensive production processes,
as they develop, these industries also employ much
more labour than other industries, contributing
to the creation of formal manufacturing jobs with
decent wages in often mainly agrarian economies (see
Figure 3.5).

Among the labour-intensive, low-tech industries,
the food and beverage industry is the only one that
sustains value-added growth as countries develop
to upper middle and high incomes (see Figure 3.4),
attributable to the industry’s relatively higher labour
productivity growth and longer growth of employment, which are expressed in elasticity (Box 3.4).

faster than GDP per capita growth while less than 0

Labour-intensive industries seem to

be crucial in sustaining employment at
low incomes and are the main reason for
manufacturing’s overall role in employment
generation at early stages of structural change

advantage, they tend to lose competitiveness in wearing apparel quite fast, though labour costs are not
always the sole determinant of cost competitiveness
(see Box 4.1 in Chapter 4).
Labour-intensive industries thus seem to be crucial in sustaining employment at low incomes and
are the main reason for manufacturing’s overall role
in employment generation at early stages of structural
change. As the population begins shifting from agriculture, setting up labour-intensive industries may
be the only option to absorb productively the many
people seeking jobs. There are also opportunities for
capital accumulation, and these are largely restricted
to food and beverages and to textiles.
Labour-intensive, low-tech industries provide
significant opportunities for entry in low- and lower
middle-income countries. African economies, as well
as some Asian economies, can use these industries as a
stepping stone towards industrialization. In addition

3
Structural change in manufacturing

The food and beverage industry retains a decent
level of labour productivity growth and shows a
slower decline in employment than textiles and wearing apparel, helping maintain high value added and
employment across all incomes (Figure 3.7).
Textiles and wearing apparel both reduce value
added and employment as countries move into upper
middle and high incomes, but the industries differ in
their ability to substitute capital for labour. The textile
industry can prolong the growth of value added after it
starts reducing employment due to its greater ability to
substitute capital for labour, as seen in a higher elasticity of labour productivity than in wearing apparel (see
Figure 3.7). In contrast, low-wage labour is the key factor input for production in wearing apparel, where the
growth rates of employment and value added decline
almost in parallel, indicating limited room for the
industry to substitute capital for labour. This characteristic implies that once countries lose the labour-cost

Medium-tech industries share some

common development patterns in emerging
economies as prominent manufacturing
industries during the upper middle-income
development stage, but show slower growth
than high-tech industries at high incomes

3
Structural change in manufacturing

to being attractive thanks to their capacity to generate employment and productivity, these industries
exhibit low barriers to entry and initially cater to local
tastes. Low-tech industries do not require huge capital outlays, and factories can be set up with workers
who have fairly low skills. Local markets play a key
role at the early stage of development, resulting in low
information and learning costs. While some of these
industries are highly competitive, particularly textiles
and garments, new producers in lower income developing countries can benefit from continuous changes
in international market conditions, particularly cost
conditions, and thus at least can temporarily attract
investment to their shores.
Medium-tech industries
Medium-tech industries share some common development patterns in emerging economies as prominent manufacturing industries during the upper

middle-income development stage, but show slower
growth than high-tech industries at high incomes.
Non-metallic minerals, basic metals and fabricated
metals fall into this category (see Table 3.2).
The non-metallic mineral industry is driven largely
by domestic demand, producing bricks, cement and
glass mainly for construction. The industry, like
labour-intensive, low-tech industries, develops at quite
low incomes. But the industry can sustain value-added
growth longer than the textile and wearing apparel
industries due to its slower decline in employment
growth while keeping similar or higher labour productivity than these low-tech industries (Figure 3.8).
Basic metals and fabricated metals have a similar
development pattern in value added per capita, but the
relationships between the rates of growth of labour
productivity and employment, which underlie the
changes in their per capita value added, differ markedly between them (see Figure 3.4). Basic metals tend

High-tech industries emerge at a fairly

late stage of development and make a major
contribution to manufacturing value added, usually
after countries reach an upper middle-income level

High-tech industries
Chemical products, machinery and equipment, electrical machinery and apparatus, and motor vehicles are
classified as high-tech industries.4 Except for chemical
products, they emerge at a fairly late stage of development and make a major contribution to manufacturing value added, usually after countries reach an upper
middle-income level. Their contribution to manufacturing value added is much more significant than it is
to manufacturing employment because any of these
high-tech industries are unlikely to reach the peak
employment level of the three above labour-intensive
industries – food and beverages, textiles and wearing
apparel. Chemicals, machinery and equipment, and

electrical machinery and apparatus are often the only
ones that can sustain growth faster than GDP per capita growth at high incomes.
These three industries have fast growth of value
added (elasticity greater than 1) over a wide range of
incomes, mainly due to their rapid increase in labour
productivity growth from upper middle incomes
(Figure 3.9). Electrical machinery and apparatus and
to a lesser extent machinery and equipment seem to
undergo considerable technological change. These
industries have an extensive expansion stage at lower
middle-incomes, where increasing their employment
growth rates is the key contributing factor to their
value added growth. Then, from the upper middleincome stage, development is based more on rising
labour productivity, which sustains the fast growth
of value added during the slowdown of employment
growth (and later even a reduction of the labour
force).
The chemicals industry seems to share the characteristics of domestic-oriented industries, such as food
and beverages, non-metallic minerals, machinery and
equipment, and electrical machinery and apparatus.
Although it belongs to the high-tech group, it often
emerges at an earlier stage of a country’s development
due to demand for soap and basic chemical products
such as colouring matters and tanning agents. Further,
like the two domestic-oriented industries, it reduces
its level of employment very slowly after reaching the
peak. But at high incomes chemicals can increase
value added rapidly through fast growth of labour productivity, similar to machinery and equipment and to
electrical machinery and apparatus. These mixed characteristics of the chemical industry seem to reflect the
fact that it includes the production of a broad range of
products with diverse technological content.
Finally, the motor vehicle industry is one of a few
industries that show markedly different patterns of
development between large and small countries (see
Figure 3.9). For this reason the development characteristics of the industry are introduced in the subsection Country size below, which discusses the impact of
that variable on manufacturing development.

3
Structural change in manufacturing

to see a fairly rapid decline in employment growth, but
the rapid increase in labour productivity helps sustain
the growth of value added (see Figure 3.8). The fabricated metal industry decreases both the rate of labour
productivity and the employment growth rate, but
the slower decline of the latter prolongs the growth of
industry’s value added (see Figure 3.8).
Thus, while both industries produce metals, the
basic metal industry as it develops employs a much
more capital-intensive production process, which leads
to higher labour productivity. The fabricated metal
industry seems to be located further downstream in
the production value chain linking material and product producers, which involves more customization and
less-automated production processes.
Medium-tech industries offer investment potential for middle- and upper middle-income developing
countries. Although they do not generate significant
employment, they are high-productivity industries
and can generate resources for investment. Further,
their products include steel, bricks, cement, boilers,
metallic structures, hand tools and plastics, most of
which are intermediate goods in high demand by more
advanced industries. Global markets for industrial
inputs are growing fast, underpinned by the demand
of emerging industrial powerhouses in East Asia, so
these industries can also become important sources of
foreign exchange.

High-tech industries perform a less important
role in sustaining employment at higher incomes, as
they only partly compensate for job losses in labourintensive industries. But they are critical for capital
accumulation, skill development and improving the
knowledge base of countries – and thus for improving
productivity and, as will be seen, wages.
Changing elasticities of value added and
employment
This subsection compares changes in the elasticities of
value added and employment as real GDP per capita
increases across industries (Figures 3.10 and 3.11). As
in the development patterns of low-tech industries,
economies generally experience fast growth of value
added before reaching a high income. Among the
three low-tech industries here, only food and beverages sustain growth over a long period, though it falls
slowly. In contrast, the value added of textiles and
66

wearing apparel declines relatively soon after the end
of their fast-growth periods, and faster than in other
industries.
Medium-tech industries maintain fast growth over
a wider income range than low-tech industries. They
also have a longer slow-growth range before decline
(shown in orange in Figure 3.10), indicating that their
growth rates decrease much more gradually than those
of textiles and wearing apparel. Among the three technology groups, high-tech industries grow fast over the
longest income range. Chemicals especially, as well as
machinery and equipment, and electrical machinery
and apparatus, sustain their growth up to very high
incomes, and are unlikely to experience a decline of
value added before reaching $40,000 GDP per capita.
Employment growth takes place over a narrower
range of income in all manufacturing industries compared with value-added growth (see Figure 3.11).
Industries that start with a relatively high level of

Food and beverages and textiles are the

two major industries for both employment
and value added at low incomes. The
trajectories of the two industries diverge,

employment, such as food and beverages, textiles, nonmetallic minerals and chemicals, see little fast growth
in employment as they develop. At low incomes, wearing apparel can increase employment significantly,
but once growth starts slowing, it does so sharply and
starts declining within a short income range. Some
high-tech industries, such as machinery and equipment and electrical machinery and apparatus, can continue fast employment growth after reaching an upper
middle income, but they also slow their employment
growth significantly, usually before hitting $15,000
GDP per capita, and nearly all manufacturing industries reduce their levels of employment at very high
incomes of above $25,000 GDP per capita.
Figure 3.12 illustrates manufacturing structural
change by showing how the shares of employment
and value added in the manufacturing total for each
industry change as country incomes rise. Food and
beverages and textiles are the two major industries for

both employment and value added at low incomes.
The trajectories of the two industries diverge, however,
as countries industrialize. Although textiles reduce
both the value added and employment shares continuously (as seen in the movement of arrows towards the
bottom left corner), food and beverages increase the
share of employment at higher incomes after an initial
decline, though the value-added share keeps declining.
This U shape for food and beverages is mainly due to
the rapid decline and then increase in the employment
share.
For long-term manufacturing development, key
industries for value added, besides food and beverages,
are machinery and equipment, chemicals, and electrical machinery and apparatus – and for employment,
machinery and equipment, fabricated metals, and rubber and plastic. Machinery and equipment similarly
increases both value-added and employment shares as
countries develop, reflected by its 45-degree line.

Employment in manufacturing-related
services
The development impact of manufacturing is not
confined to value added and employment within the

sector. This subsection examines how different service
industries depend on the demands of manufacturing industries, and how these relationships change as
countries develop.5
Labour-intensive, low-tech industries such as textiles and wearing apparel generate a large number of
jobs in countries at low incomes, but such employment
generates fewer related services jobs (Figure 3.13). In
industrialized countries textiles and wearing apparel
are steadily cutting manufacturing and related services employment.
Although medium- and high-tech industries do
not generate as many jobs as low-tech industries, their
contributions to creating related services jobs are
much higher. Figure 3.14 shows that medium-tech
industries such as non-metallic minerals and basic
and fabricated metals generate a higher proportion of
manufacturing-related services jobs relative to manufacturing jobs. Increases in manufacturing-related
services employment often compensate (or more than
compensate) for the reduction in manufacturing jobs.
Countries at high incomes could sustain fast
growth of some high-tech industries, such as chemicals
and motor vehicles (for large countries; Figure 3.15).
These industries also make significant contributions

to manufacturing-related services employment, especially business services.
Thus, if we take employment in manufacturingrelated services into account, manufacturing’s contribution to job creation is more sustained than
Figure 3.5 suggests. Although the decline in labourintensive, low-tech industries reduces manufacturing

jobs as countries reach high incomes, medium- and
high-tech industries, especially those sustaining valueadded growth at high incomes, create a relatively high
proportion of jobs in manufacturing-related services.
These contributions are important not only for making up for declining manufacturing jobs but also for
generating modern service jobs, which are likely to

and if at all only slowly, taking historical studies as evidence (see, for example, Chenery and Syrquin 1975,
Clark 1957, Hoffmann 1958, and Kuznets 1966). But
individual manufacturing industries do change their
characteristics over the years.
For example, the value added pattern of the textile industry has shifted downward over the years,
in contrast to the employment pattern of the rubber and plastic industry for small countries (Figure
3.16). 6 This means that rubber and plastics can
generate more employment for a country at the
same income as 10 years previously. This shift adds
a dynamic element to the analysis, allowing us to
assess how technology, demand and other factors
that evolve over time change the course of manufacturing development.
To identify the emerging characteristics of the 18
manufacturing industries in Table 3.2, the trends of
both the levels of value added and employment have
been studied for each industry since 1980. The results
are categorized under five headings (Table 3.3).
The results show that a large number of industries
are increasing their capital intensity.7 The seven industries intensifying capital use have added value without increasing or even while decreasing employment.
This is an industry-wide trend, so it characterizes the
situation of those industries across countries at different incomes. The results seem to point to rising

play a crucial role in linking high-tech manufacturing industries with innovative service activities that
support growth of increasingly service-oriented highincome countries.
Beyond service employment directly dependent on
manufacturing production, employment is generated
throughout the production chain due to backward
linkages and multiplier effects of production. If these
full production effects are included, manufacturingrelated employment increases a further 10–30 percent.
In short, manufacturing structural change offers
employment opportunities for high-income countries
as they transit from high-tech manufacturing production to manufacturing-related services. Developed
countries aiming to increase value added while generating employment may thus find it optimal to focus
on innovation and marketing, if they are not doing so
already, to compensate partly or fully for the loss of
such production jobs.

value added while decreasing (or at least not increasing) employment, it is “Intensifying
capital use”. When there is evidence of an increase in employment and a decrease or no
change in value added, it is “Intensifying labour use”. If there is no significant change in
value added and employment, it is “Stable”. Industries exhibiting ambiguous trends are
excluded; they are wearing apparel, wood products, printing and publishing, coke and
refined petroleum, machinery and equipment, and precision instruments.

mechanization and standardization of production
processes in many medium- and high-tech industries.
Only two industries, rubber and plastics and furniture, are increasing employment (the former, value
added as well). Tobacco and textiles are declining
industries as they have been reducing value added and
employment, though this does not necessarily imply
that their output volume or demand for their products has been decreasing in absolute terms, as production volume may still rise alongside a declining price
trend.
Finally, food and beverages have been remarkably stable (and in fact is one of the key industries
for both value added and employment in countries
across different incomes and different geographical
and demographic conditions). This stability no doubt
stems from the nature of its products, which serve the
basic needs of human beings in differentiated national
markets.
Thus many medium- and high-tech industries have
become capital intensive since the 1980s, increasing
value added without adding much labour.

Structural change in manufacturing

Emerging trend

Changes in manufacturing structure over time
As individual manufacturing industries change their
characteristics over the years, the industries’ relative
importance and the structure of manufacturing also
evolves. This subsection discusses how the development potential of manufacturing industries has
changed since the 1960s. 8
In the 1960s and 2000s in value-added terms,
high-tech industries developed more than mediumtech industries, which reached higher levels of development than low-tech textiles and wearing apparel
(Figure 3.17). Divergence tends to occur in the upper
middle-income stage when high-, medium- and lowtech industries start experiencing faster, slower and
negative growth, respectively. But in the 2000s the
development potential of high-tech industries is much
higher than in the 1960s, while there are not noticeable differences in the development patterns of lowtech and medium-tech industries. Among high-tech
industries, chemicals and electrical machinery and
apparatus have greatly increased their development
potential relative to other industries, by increasing per
capita value added and accelerating their growth rates.
Employment patterns have changed less than value
added between the two periods (Figure 3.18). Among
low-tech industries, employment in textiles has been
markedly lower in recent years while food and beverages and wearing apparel slightly increased and
decreased, respectively, their potential for job creation.
Another difference in employment patterns between
the 1960s and the 2000s is the slower decline of
employment in high-tech industries at high incomes:
they now have greater ability to keep employment over
a wider range of incomes.
Effects of country size, population density
and natural resource endowment
Income is usually the most influential determinant of
manufacturing structure, as seen, but countries with
different geographical and demographic conditions,
history and policies – country-specific attributes­–
may pull away from its influence somewhat. For example, the endowment of abundant natural resources

Country size
Chapter 1 showed that a larger population is generally
conducive to manufacturing development. Figure 3.19

confirms that small countries generally have lower
value added in manufacturing than large countries.
There are also differences in structural change within
manufacturing between large and small countries.
Large countries, at higher incomes, tend to have a
divergent pattern of thriving and other industries,
while in small countries, growth in most manufacturing industries slows at higher incomes. By industry,
small countries are likely to develop food and beverages much earlier than large countries, but that industry’s growth in those countries is not as sustainable as
in large countries: growth in food and beverages starts
slowing at around $10,000 GDP per capita and continues to slow, or even decline, at higher incomes.
Another difference is in motor vehicles. In large
countries it is one of the key industries leading industrialization from an upper middle-income stage.
(Other key industries are electrical machinery and
apparatus, chemicals, machinery and equipment,
and food and beverages.) In small countries the
industry’s development prospects are limited. The
difference may stem from a lack of the economies of

– and geographical conditions affect manufacturing
structure. It shows that a country’s population size –
based on the maximum likelihood test for identifying
structural breaks, large countries are defined as having more than 20 million people, and small countries
fewer than that – tends to have overarching influence
on economic structural change (Chenery and Taylor
1968).
Densely populated countries, owing to a negative association with availability of mineral wealth,
arable land and other natural endowments per head,
are likely to specialize more in manufacturing and
in less resource-intensive manufacturing industries.
Such countries may also draw advantages from lower
transport and coordination costs (Keesing and Sherk
1971). Exports of resource commodities often lead to
currency appreciation and make tradable manufacturing products less competitive.

scale within the domestic market needed to put the
industry on a long-term growth path. It may also
be because multinational automotive companies
often localize production in countries with a large
domestic market and serve smaller countries through
exports from them.
As with value added, emerging patterns of subsector manufacturing employment are similar between
large and small countries (except for food and beverages and for motor vehicles), but employment in small
countries is generally lower across industries (Figure
3.20). Food and beverages is the single most important
manufacturing employer across different incomes for
small countries, but in large countries three industries
– textiles, wearing apparel and food and beverages
– together create a major portion of manufacturing
employment up to upper middle-income level. Then,
machinery and equipment, motor vehicles and electrical machinery and apparatus generate substantial
employment at high incomes up to around $30,000
GDP per capita. At this stage in large countries the
motor vehicle industry can become one of the top five

sources of manufacturing employment (but is insignificant for small countries).
Population density and natural resources
Higher population density is associated with positive impacts on value added in mainly medium- and
high-tech industries, characterized as relatively capital
and technology intensive, a finding largely expected
(Figure 3.21). The strong impact on chemicals, motor
vehicles and machinery and equipment may reflect the
importance of distribution systems and production
agglomerations.
The effect of natural resource endowments on
manufacturing valued added is also clear (Box 3.5;
see Figure 3.21), and largely confirms the economywide results seen in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.4). High
endowments do not have a positive effect on a single
industry, but they have particularly strong negative
effects on electrical machinery and apparatus, motor
vehicles (for large countries) and chemicals, which
are key in deepening and sustaining industrialization from the upper middle-income stage. Thus for

Quality of manufacturing employment
Manufacturing’s contribution to employment cannot be fully assessed unless one also considers qualitative aspects, particularly, wages and aspects of female
employment.
Manufacturing generally offers a competitive wage
relative to the whole economy’s average (see Figures 1.12
and 1.13 in Chapter 1). But wages between industries
vary, making employment in some more favourable
than others for poverty reduction, better living standards and a country’s economic development in general.

as to avoid undue currency appreciation and underinvestment in physical and human capital.

from different regions and at different incomes shows
a positive correlation between wages and labour productivity relative to the manufacturing sector’s average (Table 3.4; Nübler 2013a).9 Industries with high
labour productivity pay high wages, those with lower
labour productivity (mainly labour-intensive, low-tech
industries) pay below the average manufacturing wage
(Box 3.6).
The table also shows female employment relative
to the manufacturing average. Labour-intensive, lowtech industries employ larger shares of female workers
than the average, especially wearing apparel and textiles, both of which have low productivity and wages.
Precision instruments and electrical machinery and
apparatus, in which manual dexterity is particularly
valued, tend to have higher female employment than
the average.
The following two subsections look further into
wages and female employment by countries’ income
group.

Box 3.6	
Why low wages are the norm for wearing apparel
The wearing apparel industry has limited room for
substituting capital for labour or the potential to raise
labour productivity through capital investment because
labour-intensive production processes with low-wage
workers are the key contributing factor in the industry’s
success. While in a short to medium term, productivity
increase might help keep production cost low (see Box
4.1 in Chapter 4), in the long term, once countries lose
their wage advantage, the industry cannot usually sustain growth and tends to move on to new, lower wage
countries. This characteristic explains why wearing
apparel has the lowest wage and productivity among
manufacturing industries.

Wages
Among low-, middle- and high-income countries,
low-income countries have the largest wage differences among manufacturing industries (Figure 3.23).

As textiles and wearing apparel are two of the three
largest sources of manufacturing employment for
these countries (food and beverages are the other – see
Figure 3.5), many people are in low-wage manufacturing employment there, which coexists with fewer

jobs paying far higher wages than the manufacturing
average.
This wage structure does not necessarily work
against a country’s development as long as the wages
of this majority of manufacturing employment are

As countries develop, differences

in wage levels among manufacturing
industries tend to narrow due to the rise
in labour productivity in low-wage jobs

Structural change in manufacturing

higher than in the main sources of employment – that
is, agricultural, subsistence and informal activities.
This is usually the case as is often seen in the large
internal migration from rural to urban areas during
early industrialization. Thus the emergence of lowtech manufacturing industries and the creation of a
large number of jobs that require only basic skills can
help substantially reduce poverty in countries at this
income.
At higher incomes the manufacturing structure
shifts from labour intensity to skill intensity, and
the weight of medium- and high-tech industries in
manufacturing employment grows (see Figure 3.5).
While medium- and high-tech industries do not create as many jobs as food and beverages, textiles and
wearing apparel, their wages are usually higher than
in those low-tech industries. In addition, as countries
develop, differences in wage levels among manufacturing industries tend to narrow due to the rise in
labour productivity in low-wage jobs (see Figure 3.23).
Manufacturing employment may thus lose headcount
attractiveness as incomes rise, but the sector’s structural change helps raise its wages.
Female employment
Employment in manufacturing, as in other sectors,
is not gender neutral, though data are scarce.10 Due
to alleged and actual differences in physical abilities,
divergent social norms and expectations for men and
women, differences in access to training and education
and outright discrimination, some manufacturing sectors are feminized, others are not.
Female employment tends to concentrate in lowtech, export-oriented and labour-intensive industries (Figure 3.24). In low-income countries the
female share of employment is nearly 50 percent in
tobacco, textiles and electrical machinery and apparatus. Relative to other country-income groups, these
economies often have high female labour force participation rates – though still lower than male rates
– among the various manufacturing industries. This
is partly because at an early stage of industrialization, manufacturing industries (regardless of type)

78

are much more labour intensive than at later stages
(Haraguchi 2012).
In low- and middle-income countries food and
beverages, textiles and wearing apparel are the major
sources of formal manufacturing employment.
Women’s participation in that workforce may not be
far behind (or is even higher than) men’s participation
in textiles and wearing apparel during manufacturing’s incipient and take-off stages. Since women tend
to allocate their incomes more to food and education
than men, manufacturing development has important
implications not only for improving women’s economic and social status but also for alleviating poverty (World Bank 2013a). But women have less access
than men to high-paying jobs, which are far fewer
than labour-intensive manufacturing jobs in low- and
middle-income countries but which are found in some
medium- and high-tech industries.
Manufacturing in industrialized countries may
have been less conducive to improving women’s economic status than the earlier stage of industrialization. Although higher paying jobs become more available in high-tech industries in countries with high
incomes, it seems that women are stuck in industries
with lower compensation. Even in the high-tech
industry of electrical machinery and apparatus, where
women have quite high participation in the low- and
middle-income stages of development, they lose out
on employment to men (see Figure 3.24). This is probably related to the change in the nature of the industry
from relatively labour-intensive, assembly-type activities to more technology-­driven activities as countries
develop.
Thus regardless of a country’s stage of development, women’s manufacturing employment is skewed
towards labour-intensive jobs, which derive their competitiveness from flexibility and cost rather than skills.
This tendency might help lift women’s economic status when a country has few formal manufacturing
jobs because in such circumstances labour-intensive
manufacturing jobs allow people without skills to get
a formal job, which is often superior to the alternative
jobs on wages and security.

But as industrialization advances, continuing concentration of female employment in labour-intensive
work is a concern because such work usually pays
less than jobs in other manufacturing industries that
become more common as countries develop.

in manufacturing value added and employment
are estimated based on the UNIDO Industry

The database includes unbalanced panel data of
74 countries for value added and 95 countries
for employment for 1963–2007. Employment
data included in the database are mostly formal
employment, including employees of firms with at
least 10 employees.
Value added per capita of a manufacturing industry indicates the development level of the industry
in an internationally comparable manner, as GDP
per capita does for a country’s economy. For the
employment–population ratio, because employment divided by population tends to be a very
small number, it is multiplied by 100.
There are low-tech industries not considered
labour intensive, such as tobacco. As the three
low-tech industries included in this section are all
labour intensive (Annex 2), they are labelled here
labour-intensive, low-tech industries.
The motor vehicle industry includes assembly as
well as production of parts and accessories.
The analysis in this section uses the World InputOutput Database (Timmer 2012). Here manufacturing-related services employment is defined
as employment in the services sector, required
for producing and delivering manufacturing
products.
Value added is proxied by value added per capita
and employment by the employment population
ratio.
Here, this characterization applies to an industrywide trend as opposed to structural change along
income level. The former, industry-wide, trend
points to the fact that the same industry across all
countries (for example, the basic metals industry,
in countries with a GDP per capita of $2,000 and
$25,000) has become capital intensive over the
last 30 years. The latter case, structural change
along income level, differs from this section’s
analysis. For example, it refers to the situation in

which the level of an industry’s capital intensity
rises as income increases (this is usually the case
for all industries, including furniture and wearing
apparel).
8.	 Figure  3.17, which shows the recent pattern of
manufacturing development in the 2000s, is quite
similar to Figure 3.4, which is based on the data
since 1963 because recent data are more available than the data from earlier years in UNIDO
(2012a).
9.	 Nübler (2013a) conducted a regression analysis on
the correlation between relative wages and relative
value added. The relationship was statistically significant with R 2 of 0.43.
Each of the three indicators was calculated
for a particular sector in a particular country by
normalizing and making the average value of the
entire manufacturing sector 1. Then the value of
each sector was calculated as the average of the
countries, for which the indicator was calculated
for each sector.
10.	 Employment data by gender at the manufacturing subsector level are very limited, so the few
countries for which data are available are included
in each income group. For Figure 3.24, 2005 is
selected to maximize the number of countries
while comparing different income groups for the
same year. The following countries are in each
income group. Low-income countries: Eritrea,
Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan and Tanzania. Middleincome countries: Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Ecuador,
India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan,
Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Morocco, the
Philippines and Turkey. High-income countries:
Croatia, Cyprus, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Malta and Oman. Data for the same sets of countries for 1998 and 2000 show structures of female
employment shares in manufacturing largely similar to the 2005 figures.

Section 2 Drivers of manufacturing structural change
and employment generation

This section first looks at what drives the structural
change and industrial development analysed above.
The drivers’ interactions are extremely diverse, complex and non-linear but what stands out is that costs,
as well as technological and demand conditions,
remain crucial. In principle, structural change in any
sector in any country is governed by the conditions
of demand and supply for products and services that
interact with each other. Supply-side conditions generally include wages, skills, technological change, firm
size, location of production facilities and the overall
business environment, which also determine industry’s competitiveness and organization. Demand-side
conditions include demand for imports and exports as
well as foreign direct investment.
This section then looks at trade. Trade openness is
an opportunity – and a threat – for low-income countries because it has not enhanced structural change
in all regions. East Asia has become one of the most

important manufacturing production networks,
aided by liberalization, while Latin America and SubSaharan Africa have been largely left behind. Trade
is underpinned by global value chains, and although
these value chains may play less of a role in the future,
technological upgrading is the best long-term strategy
for a country to stay in them.
Finally, one emerging driver that deserves closer
analysis is the efficient use of natural resources, both
to keep costs down and preserve the environment. The
paradigm of continually increasing demand of finite
resources must be shifted as the past abundance of relatively inexpensive natural resources, such as energy,
water, and materials, is coming to an end. Approaches
towards this “green structural change” will include
adopting industries more technologically advanced
and with higher labour and capital productivity. The
key thus lies in decoupling natural resource use and
environmental impacts from economic activity.

Chapter 4

Cost and supply-side
structural change drivers
This chapter looks at five main supply-side drivers of
structural change in manufacturing: wages, skills,
technological change, industrial organization and the
overall business environment. Figure  4.1 shows the
main supply and external demand drivers discussed in
this and the following chapters. The list is by no means
exhaustive, and not all the possible combinations
of interactions have been included, due to a limited
availability of evidence, but some of the key drivers of
structural change and their interrelationships are discussed here.
Wages, sometimes considered the most important
factor for the supply of manufactured goods, determine the cost of employment and through this the
competitiveness of the industry. They also feed back
into aggregate demand for manufactured products
on the domestic market. Neoclassical theory suggests that, other things equal, rising wages cause individual producers to limit or cut back on employment
because they will tend to replace labour by investing
in equipment and technology or ceasing production of
goods that can no longer be manufactured profitably.
The resulting argument is that lower wages stimulate
production in manufacturing. But this view does not
consider that low wages come with low labour productivity and high wages with higher productivity, which
can stimulate increased production. Further, there is
now enough evidence to suggest that high labour costs
are often compensated for by advantages in infrastructure, logistics, cost and availability of supplies as well
as the business environment. Wage costs remain, however, a main element of costs in most activities, and
in a few labour-intensive sectors are the main drivers
determining overall unit production costs.
Industrial development unfolds according to
the labour force’s capacity to develop the appropriate skills in manufacturing. Such skills determine
the competitiveness of an industrial sector and the
structural change that occurs within it. Skills for
manufacturing change, and every stage of industrial
82

development requires its particular skill set. The most
sophisticated sectors require a high order of technical
skills. But investing in a pool of highly educated university graduates does not help in a developing country
context – it is too early. Over long periods change in
manufacturing has been biased towards using more
skilled labour, which has widened wage inequality
and weakened the relationship between output and
employment growth in manufacturing in low- and
lower middle-income countries.
Technological change is at the heart of structural
change. Technology has important implications for
the productivity of industrial processes and thus on
the scale and scope of industrial production. Gains
in technology raise productivity – and so fewer workers (and often fewer other resources) are required to
create the same output. A useful distinction can be
made between process innovation based on capital
investment, which saves labour (machines replace
workers), and product innovation based on research
and development (R&D), which leads to new and
better products and often creates new jobs by extending production to penetrate new markets. So it is far
from inevitable that technological change reduces
manufacturing employment in total. It will depend on
the choices made – and the incentives provided – by
society.
Industrial organization is another driver. It covers firm size and economies of scale in production,
the way that production is organized across domestic
and global value chains and the spatial distribution of
production within national economies. For example,
smaller firms on the international stage have generated fast employment growth but slower productivity
growth, when controlling for other factors like firm
age. Fragmentation of the production process along
national and global value chains provides incentives
for producers to engage in location-specific labourintensive segments of manufacturing. Agglomeration

are important in improving competitiveness and raising employment, but clusters alone cannot guarantee
these gains, which require supportive infrastructure
and supplier networks and good managerial capacity.
Finally, there is the business environment, more an
underlying condition than a driver. It includes access
to energy, water and transport facilities, as well as
institutional aspects related to government support,
regulations, taxes and corruption, all of which influence production cost. In many countries access to
finance is particularly critical, and can become a key
constraint to structural change.
But the impact of supply-side drivers on structural
change has not been unambiguous. Wages can support
employment generation or hinder it depending not
only on their level and how they are set but also on the
availability of infrastructure. The timing of the provision of the required skills seems to be crucially important for them to perform a positive role in supporting
new job creation. Technology sheds labour if it is process oriented but generates employment if it is product

oriented. It is the state (alongside the private sector)
that needs to work hard to ensure that the drivers support employment generation while transforming the
economy (a point taken up further in Chapter 7).
Wages: important, but not the
only driver
Wage costs contribute to structural change in manufacturing as they determine overall production costs
and competitiveness. But the advantage of low wage
costs can be offset by low labour productivity or cost
disadvantages for infrastructure, input supplies or
regulations and taxes affecting the business environment, as well as by macroeconomic problems leading
to inflation and an overvalued exchange rate.
A wage advantage is more important in some
areas of manufacturing than others depending on the
labour intensity of production (Annex 2 lists labourintensive manufacturing industries).1 Three labourintensive industries – wearing apparel, textiles, and
food and beverages – are particularly important for

industrialization to take off (see Patterns of structural
change and employment generation within manufacturing in Chapter 3). Globally, these three industries
account for 30 percent of manufacturing value added,
but the share varies by income: low-income countries
have a 15–20  percent higher share than the global
average, and high-income countries a 10–15 percent
lower share (Figure 4.2). All country income groups
have, however, been reducing their share of labourintensive industries in manufacturing value added
over the last 20 years.
Costs per worker vary hugely around the world but
low wages are no guarantee of cost competitiveness even
in labour-intensive tradable sectors. There is considerable evidence that economies with low absolute wages
in dollar terms, such as most of Sub-Saharan Africa,
are still uncompetitive in many light-manufacturing
industries. Producers can stay competitive only if productivity gains match wage increases, as illustrated by
survey data of formal firms in China, Ethiopia, the
United Republic of Tanzania, Viet Nam and Zambia

from 2009/10 (Dinh et al. 2012).2 For most products
and processes analysed (polo shirts, wooden chairs,
leather loafers and wheat processing), the advantage of
low wages was offset by lower labour productivity, as
well as by higher input and logistics costs, such that for
factory-gate costs African firms in all countries could
compete with China only on leather goods.
This point is further backed up by Clarke (2012)
whose analysis of World Bank Enterprise Surveys
since 2006 shows African firms paying wages well
below those of East Asian exporting economies. But
once one controls for per capita income across countries, wages in Africa are higher than expected relative to those in surveyed firms in economies at similar
incomes. Because of the productivity differences, unit
labour costs in East Asia (China, Indonesia, Malaysia
and the Philippines) are an estimated 20 percent lower
than in Africa (Clarke 2012).
These examples confirm that low-wage economies cannot necessarily compete with China or other
low-cost suppliers simply with wages, even in simple
labour-intensive activities. Instead, industries can be
set up and jobs created when unit labour costs are low
– and costs of other production factors are favourable.
There is scope for policy intervention and infrastructure investment by public and private sectors. Wages
are only one piece in the puzzle for where it makes
sense to locate (Box 4.1).
Skills: an often underrated driver
Skill formation shapes the capacity to produce industrial goods competitively. Crucial for industrial development, it is expected to positively affect economic growth
as a whole (DFID 2011; Box 4.2; also see Chapter 8).
Many studies support the argument that education has a positive impact on economic growth.
Bassanini and Scarpetta (2001) and Sianesi and van
Reenen (2003) report, for example, that a one-year
increase in average education raises per capita income
3–6 percent. Topel (1999), analysing labour productivity, finds that a one-year increase in the average
years of schooling of the labour force raises output
per worker 5–15 percent. Skill development not only

affects individual’s employability, but it also allows
him or her to increase wages and helps ensure better
job quality and labour conditions (Vandenberghe and
Debande 2004). Increased skills are related to higher
rates of labour force participation, especially among
women (Table 4.1).
Social and private returns to education
A number of studies have calculated returns on investment in education. Psacharopoulos and Patrinos
(2004a) found that social returns (which take into
account externalities, as other people benefit from
knowledge spillovers of an individual’s higher education) and private returns on investment in education
were positive, especially for less developed countries
(Table 4.2).3 Their results emphasize that primary
education is more important in regions with lower

achieved its productivity growth through several channels:
a high rate of firm turnover facilitated the closure of unproductive firms and the entry of productive companies, and
among those that continued operating, process innovation
and greater educational attainment of workers came into
play. Fukunishi and Yamagata found no evidence of product upgrading.
Cambodian garment firms thus successfully mitigated
the adverse effect of increased wages on competitiveness by lifting productivity, while the Bangladeshi firms
absorbed rising costs by reducing the large profit margin
that they had enjoyed under the Multifibre Arrangement
(MFA), which allowed it preferential exports to developed
countries. In Kenya, where wages were higher than in the
other countries, many garment firms closed after the MFA
ended in 2005, suggesting that the country found it hard
to maintain competitiveness with its rising wages.
The overall conclusions are two-fold. First, employment in the garment industry provides a good income
opportunity for the less educated. Even after trade liberalization and the end of the MFA, real wages have increased
and working conditions improved. Second, productivity
growth is the key to expanding production and employment and upgrading job quality, even when wages are
rising.

Cost and supply-side structural change drivers

A study based on firm-level data from Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya and Madagascar for 2002 and 2008 finds
that despite having similarly low wages, the four countries
have very different pathways for increasing productivity and developing their garment industry (Fukunishi and
Yamagata 2013). All low-income countries, they experienced rapid growth in garment exports to developed countries. The Bangladeshi industry started to grow in the early
1980s, followed by that of Madagascar in the beginning of
1990s, based on investment from Mauritius. The Cambodian industry started exports in the late 1990s underpinned
by a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. The
Kenyan industry saw rapid growth in the early 2000s, triggered by duty-free access to the US market.
Wages in each country in 2008 were well below those
in China and in middle-income exporters like Mexico and
Turkey, suggesting that wages were driving competitiveness. But Bangladesh, Cambodia and Kenya saw substantial wage increases over 2002–2008, with nominal
wage growth ranging from 36.5 percent to 65.8 percent.
Unit costs were broadly similar in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Madagascar, as higher productivity in Cambodia
and Madagascar offset their higher wages than those in
Bangladesh.
Cambodian firms fared particularly well against those
in Bangladesh, achieving steep productivity gains, while
firms in Bangladesh had stagnant productivity. Cambodia

development, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa,
where the portion of educated people is much lower
than in other regions. For countries at higher levels of
development the importance of higher levels of educational attainment increases.
Manufacturing is a major employer of engineering graduates. The returns on investment for those
who have studied engineering at a university seem to
be higher than the average for tertiary education. They
seem to be higher in developing than industrialized
countries, and the gap is bigger for social than private
returns (Table 4.3).
A skilled labour force in manufacturing is also
expected to boost international competitiveness. For
example, investing in education has a considerable
positive effect on the growth of exports (UNIDO
2011a), and a more skilled workforce is generally

Education and economic growth in the Republic of Korea and Pakistan

Cost and supply-side structural change drivers

The Republic of Korea and Pakistan started with roughly
the same per capita income in 1950. But over 1950–2010
Pakistan’s per capita income in constant prices grew
three-fold, that of the Republic of Korea 23-fold. This discrepancy in economic performance has been attributed
largely to the differences in their educational development.
Even in 1950 the East Asian country had an advantage in
years of schooling, but by 2010 its educational development reached nearly 12 years of schooling, equivalent to
the average adult having completed secondary schooling,
whereas Pakistan’s had not yet reached 6 years of schooling, a minimum for literacy.
Similarly, both Ghana and the Republic of Korea had
a GDP per capita of roughly $300 in 1955. By 1990 in

real terms, the Republic of Korea’s GDP had increased
to $7,500, while Ghana remained at its 1955 level. A third
of the Republic of Korea’s growth was thanks to rapid
increases in educational attainment (Banerji et al. 2010),
during a period in which the country transformed manufacturing from a low-tech to a more capital- and technology-intensive structure (Box Figure 1).
Manufacturing’s slower structural change reflects
Pakistan’s slower educational development (Box Figure 2).
In 1963 the country had a similar manufacturing structure
to that in the Republic of Korea, but in 2006, while Pakistan had a more than 50 percent share of manufacturing
value added in low-tech industries, most value added in
the Republic of Korea came from high-tech industries.

shortages of certain skills at the same time. Such a
86

mismatch is due to the limited perspective of workers on job opportunities, the time lag between basic
skill development and employment, and the effects of
structural change on employment.
Take India. It has many more university graduates
with a degree in arts than the labour market can absorb,

Tunisia half of university graduates in chemistry are
mismatched in their jobs, while in Lebanon 40 percent
of the workforce is in jobs where they do not use their
skills (Almeida, Behrman and Robalino 2012).
Supply of skilled labour may not always match
demand for two reasons. First, by the time demand has
unfolded, it may be too late for firms to develop them
internally in their own workforce. Second, demand is
inadequate because firms have not well defined their real
needs because of deficiencies in developing innovation
strategies. In Tanzania some firms may have the potential to start innovating in manufacturing, but because
they have not developed a strategy they fail to hire key
staff in certain areas (MIT, POPC and UNIDO 2012).

change from agriculture to industry, a new set of skills
is required – as is another change in skills when manufacturing shifts to R&D activities (Trilling and Fadel
2009). Evidence from the European Union shows that
industrial diversification and deepening lead to a growing need for medium- and high-skilled professionals
(CEDEFOP 2008). The trend is similar for Brazil,
China and India, where the rapid transition towards

knowledge-intensive manufacturing is expected to
create shortages of both high-skilled workers (such as
engineers and scientists) and medium-skilled workers (such as technicians and factory workers) by 2030

moved from low- to high-tech production? Although
in overall terms this can be done, we are confronted
with a major constraint: huge sectoral heterogeneity
for skill intensity can lead to unrealistic and misleading generalizations. Evidence shows that activities
within the same product group can have very different skill intensities. For instance, Bruno et al. (2009)
argue that at the International Standard Industrial
Classification two-digit level, 8 of 24 sectors embody
either unskilled or skilled activities. Agroindustry,
often considered a low-tech low-skill sector, has fish
and meat processing requiring very low skill intensity,
while manufacture of wines, liquors and malt require
very high skill intensity. Similarly at the most sophisticated end of manufacturing – electronics – skill intensity varies hugely from assembly to design.
Still, the requirements for skill development generally change by a firm’s industrial deepening – low,
intermediate and advanced. Each level calls for specific technological capabilities and skills, which can be
developed with formal education and skill formation
through technology-based training (Table 4.4).

The sectors likely to be present at each level are as
follows:
•	 Low level, simple assembly and processing. Sectors
here tend to be labour-intensive with stable, welldiffused technologies embodied mainly in capital
equipment, having low R&D spending and simple skill requirements. Labour costs are often a
major element, and barriers to entry are quite low.
The market as a whole tends to grow slowly, with
an income elasticity of less than one. Particular
consumer products have high-quality segments
where brand names, skills, design and technological competence are very important, but products
of major interest to developing countries are in the
lower quality segments, based on simple technologies and price rather than quality competition. The
most representative sectors include textiles, garments, footwear and agroindustry.
•	 Intermediate level. Sectors at this level are the
heartland of industrial activity of catchingup countries, comprising the bulk of skill and
scale-intensive technologies in capital goods and

intermediates. They have relatively complex technologies, moderate R&D spending and need some
scientific skills. The most representative sectors
include engineering, transport equipment, chemicals and other processing industries.
•	 Advanced and deep industrial structure. These sectors have fast-changing technologies, with high
R&D spending, high skills and prime emphasis
on product design. The most innovative technologies require advanced-technology infrastructure
and close interactions among firms and between
firms and research institutions. The most representative sectors include electronic and electrical
products, precision instruments, pharmaceutical
and automobiles.
The shift from low-level industrial deepening
to advanced industrial structures entails changes
in technological capabilities and skill demand. The
general trend is that as countries move from simple
assembly technologies to being able to import, adapt
and operate state-of-the-art technologies, the skill
90

profile gradually evolves from basic production skills
to highly specialized professional skills.
This course also involves changes in skill acquisition through formal education and in-firm learning.
Broadly, a solid primary and secondary education is
fundamental for countries and low and intermediate
levels. Although some forms of technical training may
be needed, the emphasis is on developing basic literacy
and numeracy skills to operate simple technologies.
There is informal in-firm learning through repetition
and through trial and error but no deliberate effort by
firms to invest in skill development. Salaries at this
level are low and workforce turnover high. Although
there may be links to buyers and suppliers at the intermediate level, the interaction does not generate learning spillovers.
The structural change towards advanced industrial structures requires skills to deal with progressively more complex and fast-changing technologies.
Countries excelling in technology-intensive industries need a highly qualified labour force with a strong

Tacit knowledge – not embodied in designs or
blueprints
Tacit knowledge is in the minds of scientists, specialist workers and industry entrepreneurs. Accessing
it requires direct contacts feasible only where firms
are located close together. Tacit knowledge is more
important in some industries that others, but is typically important in the early stages of highly innovative industries before product and process designs
become codified and standardized. Key mechanisms
for transmitting tacit knowledge include start-ups by
researchers or employees of other firms, labour mobility between firms and joint research initiatives.

technical background – there is an emphasis on university enrolment in technical subjects such as science, mathematics, engineering and manufacturing.
Romijn and Albaladejo (2002) show that specialized
knowledge and experience in science and engineering
matter more than general managerial capabilities and
intermediate-level technical skills in explaining innovation excellence by high-tech firms. At this end, firms
invest heavily in skill development through in-firm
training and through direct involvement in apprenticeship programmes. In particular, specialized training by semi-public technical and vocational education
and training institutions helps firms co-share training
costs while guaranteeing the applicability of skills in
the workplace.
As the pattern of skills required to compete in
modern manufacturing changes, so must the institutions and methods for skill formation. Most traditional methods of education and training are inadequate today. In the traditional setting, industrial
development in technologically less-developed sectors
often only entailed improving the quantity and quality of primary and secondary schooling and developing basic technical skills through on-the-job training.
In the emerging competitive setting, greater emphasis is placed on high-level, specialized training, with
more formalized on-the-job training and vocational
education, featuring closer interaction between educational institutions and industry (UNIDO 2011a).
Important here is developing the tacit knowledge (as
opposed to formal or codified knowledge as taught
in formal education­– Box  4.3) that is difficult to
transfer to other users, such as using manufacturing equipment. Firms that provide training are more
likely to have higher levels of technology and skills
(CEDEFOP 2012).

and diversification into higher value added products
(Nübler 2013b). The educational attainment structure
shapes the mix, diversity and complexity of the social
knowledge structure, thus determining the options

on the Barro-Lee dataset that provides information on
the share of the labour force (older than 15 years) with
no schooling, incomplete primary, complete primary,
lower secondary, upper secondary and post-secondary
as highest educational attainment, Nübler (2013b)
developed a typology of educational attainment structures that allows for analysing a country’s options
space. By sorting these seven educational categories in
increasing order, the different lengths of the six bars
suggest five different educational structures (Figure
4.4; Box 4.4).
Empirical analysis of educational attainment
structures shows that the strong middle structures
(SM, SM+) provide the highest options for productive transformation, characterized by both industrial
widening (broadening the manufacturing base) and
industrial deepening (diversification into higher technology products; Nübler 2013c).

Typology of educational attainment structures
L-shape educational structures with the median category
being non-schoolers or (complete and incomplete) primary education show extremely low shares of upper and
post-secondary education. L+ structures have the shape
of an L-curve but with higher shares of upper and postsecondary education.
Dual structures may be described as the composition
of distinct education structures of two groups (such as
rural and urban). It shows high levels of non-schoolers and
incomplete primary education, but low shares of primary
(like the L). Secondary and post-secondary categories
show a structure more similar to the strong middle structure – that is, it includes high shares of lower, upper and
post-secondary education.

Missing middle (MM) structures demonstrate high
shares of primary and lower secondary education, very
low shares of upper secondary education and high shares
of post-secondary. MM countries have a bimodal structure with very low shares of lower and upper secondary
education. MM+ countries show a trimodal structure,
differing from the MM structure, with significantly higher
shares of lower secondary education, but lower shares of
incomplete primary education.
Strong middle (SM) structures take the form of a bell
curve with the median on primary, lower (medium categories) or upper secondary (high categories) education. As
countries increase levels of average years of schooling,
the median is shifted from primary to lower (SM) to upper
secondary education (SM+).

share of manufacturing in total production and exports
and share of medium and high technology products in
total production and exports. Analysis of educational
attainment structures and the ITA shows that countries
with strong middle education structures (SM, SM+)
achieved ITA levels above 0.3 (Figure 4.5). Countries

with ITA levels below this threshold are mainly small
economies and transition countries that have either
specialized in the services sector or on resource-based
industries. By contrast, missing middle education structures (MM, MM+) define tighter boundaries and limited options for industrial and technological expansion.
This is indicated by the lower ITA values of countries

with such structures, mainly ITA levels of below 0.2.
Further, countries with L, L+ and dual education structures face the fewest options to industrialize. ITA values for all countries remain below 0.2. While countries
with the L structure are almost exclusively below the
0.1 ITA threshold, the L+ and the dual structures with
their higher shares of secondary and post-secondary
education can pass this threshold. But these countries
developed competitiveness mainly in the garment and
textile industries at low-tech levels.
Skill-biased technological change
Technological change (discussed in the next subsection) and greater pressures to compete have put a premium on high-level technical skills. This trend started
early in the 20th century, causing a bias in technological change for technology that uses skills, suggesting that where skill-using industries are located,
better jobs are created. (This was in direct contrast to
19th century technological change, which was largely
focused on skill saving or de-skilling as tasks previously undertaken by skilled artisans were replaced by
repetitive factory-based operations.)

Accompanying this demand for skills was higher
capital investment, so that skilled labour and capital became complements not substitutes. Conte and
Vivarelli (2007), among others, tested the complementarity between technological innovation and
labour skills. They used a dataset of almost 5,000
observations from 28 manufacturing sectors in 23
countries. They found that capital deepening (a rising
capital–labour ratio) was responsible for a relative shift
in demand towards skilled labour.
The trend towards a skills bias during most of the
20th century intensified from the late 1970s with the
revolution in information and communications technology (ICT); the spread of computers and computerbased production systems; and the changes in organization practice and design of products and processes
that all this has allowed. Spitz (2004) reports that from
1979 to 1999 employment in the Federal Republic of
Germany shifted from manual labour to more analytical jobs. She considered that this change accounted for
around half the educational upgrading during these
years. And she found that skills in computer technology
were complementary to analytical and interactive skills.

ICT has been described as a “general purpose technology” with pervasive effects across the economy,
creating a continual process of technological improvement leading to falling costs for users and a continual
process of innovation (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg
1995).5 This is the equivalent of the key technological
breakthroughs of earlier times like the printing press,
steam power and electricity and also reflected in the
similar patterns of spatial distribution between manufacturing in the early 20th century and services in the
late 20th century (see Box 2.2 in Chapter 2).
ICT and computerization more widely – in
increasing demand for inputs of non-routine cognitive and manual tasks and shifting the relative
demand for labour – have created a “polarization
effect” in the employment structure of higher income
economies (Autor, Levy and Murnane 2003). These
countries generally show a falling employment share
taken by middle-skill and middle-wage occupations,
as the adoption of computer-based technologies has
increased demand for educated and skilled workers
(who can do non-routine abstract tasks) and for lowwage, low-skill workers (who have manual flexibility
and adaptability; Acemoglu and Autor 2010).
This skill bias has been explained by the rising supply of skilled workers in the technology-creating economies and may partly account for the fall in real wages
of low-skilled workers (Jaumette and Tytell 2007). In
developed economies it is now fairly well established
that technological change in a skill-biased direction
has been a key factor in creating a falling labour share
in GDP, as unskilled jobs are replaced by capital. The
significance for developing countries – as technology
importers – is that the technology transferred to them
has been created in response to market conditions in
advanced economies.
The effect of such change has been put forward as
one of the explanations as to why, unexpectedly, trade
liberalization has only rarely been associated with the
one of the key predictions of standard trade theory
– a rise in relative wages for unskilled labour in lowincome countries (Arbache, Dickerson and Green
2004; Robbins 2003). If firms in developing countries

are forced by competition and induced by trade liberalization to import best-practice technology – where
there is little scope for factor substitution – this will
raise the demand for skilled labour over unskilled and
import a skill bias into the economy.
But skill-biased technological change is not automatic in all industries in all developing countries. It
did not, for example, occur in the sewing segment in
the garment industry in Bangladesh (Fukunishi and
Yamagata 2013).
Technology: a dominant driver of
structural change
Technology determines overall output and productivity as well as labour productivity specifically.
Although labour productivity can be improved by
using technologies more efficiently over time, trends
in its growth are closely linked to how new technology
is applied and modified, and to what extent it creates
or displaces jobs.
Job creation and destruction
Most of the debate on innovation’s impact on job numbers has focused on higher income economies. There
are two main sources of innovation – R&D investment and embodied technological change (ETC),
where the innovation is embodied in new equipment.
There are also two main types of innovation outputs:
product innovation – altering the product mix by
creating either genuinely new products or products
adapted from existing designs; and process innovation
– altering the system of production to reduce costs or
improve quality (Figure 4.6).
Although the distinction is not precise, the literature on innovation suggests that only complex product innovation (delivered mainly by large firms in
high-tech sectors) relies on formal R&D, while process innovation – where it is not so easy to single out
pure innovation, diffusion and imitation – is much
more related to ETC acquired by investment in new
machinery and equipment and by purchasing external technology incorporated in licences, consultancies
and know-how. 6 Again generalizing, R&D is most

crucial in large firms and more advanced sectors, while
ETC assumes a dominant role in small and mediumsize enterprises (SMEs) and more traditional sectors.
Thus theoretically innovation has two inputs and
two outputs, with R&D mainly (but not only) related

4
Cost and supply-side structural change drivers

The two faces of innovation

to product innovation and ETC mainly (but not only)
related to process innovation, with the possibility of
some overlap in mixed activities which entail both
product and process innovation.
The main implications of the distinction for
employment are that product innovation creates jobs
through the emergence of new markets, and that process innovation creates a direct labour-saving effect,
mainly related to introducing machines that allow the
same output to be produced with fewer workers.
Although the expectation is that developing new
markets through product innovation will create new
jobs, this has to be balanced against the potential loss
of jobs in the sectors producing the displaced products. Many process innovations are intended to be
labour saving but a number of dynamic “compensating
mechanisms” exist that may offset these labour-saving
effects in whole or in part, making it difficult to calculate the exact net employment outcome of technological change (Box 4.5).
But none of these mechanisms compensating for
the direct displacement effect on jobs is automatic,
and to work they require particular conditions to
hold. Economic theory has no precise answer for the
ultimate employment impact of process innovation.

Box 4.5	
Labour-compensating mechanisms of technological change
Through new machines. The same process innovations
that displace workers in the product industries where the
new machines are introduced create new jobs in the capital industries where the new machines are produced.
Through decreases in prices. Although innovations involve
the displacement of workers, these innovations lead to a
decrease in the unit costs of production, and in a competitive market this effect leads to decreasing prices; in turn,
decreasing prices stimulate new demand for products and
so additional production and employment.
Through new investments. In cases where the competitive convergence is not direct, during the gap between the
decrease in costs – due to technological progress – and
the consequent fall in prices, extra-profits may be accumulated by innovative entrepreneurs. These profits are
invested, creating new output and new jobs.

Through declines in wages. Where there is demand for
labour, the direct effect of job-destructive technologies
may be compensated within the labour market. Assuming free competition and full substitutability between
labour and capital, technological unemployment implies a
decrease in wages and this should induce a reverse shift
back to more labour-intensive technologies.
Through increases in incomes. Trade unions may redistribute part of the innovation rent back to the workforce
and thus a portion of the cost savings due to innovation
can be translated into higher wage income and hence
higher consumption. This increase in demand leads to an
increase in employment, which may compensate for the
initial job losses due to process innovations.

Price and income mechanisms can counterbalance the
direct job destruction caused by process innovation,
but their effectiveness depends on many parameters
such as the degree of competition, demand elasticity
and the way business expectations are shaped.
Empirical studies of the innovation–employment
links have focused largely on higher income economies and tend to show that product innovations are
usually associated with employment growth, while the
effect of process innovations is often negative. R&D
spending has been shown to have a positive employment effect, principally in high-tech sectors.7 Net
employment usually rises with innovation, and government support for product development rather than
technological change is more likely to lead to employment generation.
Work on a large database created from the World
Bank Enterprise Surveys of 2002–2006 and covering
more than 26,000 manufacturing establishments in 71
countries confirms the employment–innovation link
(Dutz et al. 2011). Firms that introduced a product or
process innovation (judged by their own responses in
the survey) had employment growth of 2.9 or 2.1 percentage points, respectively, above that of non-innovating firms (controlling for all other factors). Process
innovation had a positive employment effect overall,
but not for the largest enterprises (more than 200
workers). Product innovation had a positive employment effect, which was larger than that for process
innovation and was significant for all size categories.
Innovators were also found to employ a greater
number of unskilled and female workers than noninnovators. But the link between process innovation

and unskilled employment growth was weaker than
with product innovation, and there is some evidence
that non-process innovators may have had a stronger
link with employment of unskilled labour. Female
employment in developing countries was strongly
linked to innovation, while across the whole sample of
countries it appeared to be linked to innovation only
in new and medium-size enterprises.
Industrial organization: the
underlying driver
The way an industry is organized has a profound influence on structural change through shifts in output,
productivity, growth and employment. Important elements to be considered are firm size, production fragmentation, and spatial distribution and clustering.
Firm size
Average firm size in the manufacturing sector,
measured by formal sector employees, declined in
1981–2007 in all country income groups except for
low-income countries, reflecting the fact that smaller
firms dominated start-ups and employment growth
(Table  4.5). Further, across almost all branches of
manufacturing, average firm size is lowest in highincome countries and highest in low-income countries, reflecting the trend for the proportionate share
of SMEs to rise with per capita income. 8 The larger
average firm size in the low-income group is likely to
reflect the dualistic manufacturing structure there,
with formal manufacturing dominated by large producers and a relatively large informal sector (not covered in the table), with many very small firms.

While SMEs have proved a key driver

of employment growth, they have not been
a driver of productivity improvements
within manufacturing in most cases

not the case that the employment effect is due to new
firms taking on more workers and tending to start as
SMEs. But SMEs have a significant negative association with productivity growth (again controlling for
firm age). In addition, new smaller firms, as well as
small mature firms (more than six years) tend to have
lower productivity growth, allowing for the sector in
which they operate (Ayyagari, Demirguc-Kunt and
Maksimovic 2011). The results do not differ between
groups of countries when they are separated by size of
the informal sector.
Thus it appears from this database that while
SMEs have proved a key driver of employment growth,
they have not been a driver of productivity improvements within manufacturing in most cases. Promoting
industrial SMEs to generate employment should be
accompanied by efforts to upgrade them technologically, so that these firms also perform a positive role in
capital accumulation.
The databases discussed above exclude informal
and micro firms (fewer than five employees) and so do
not capture much manufacturing in low-income countries. There, the informal economy forms the bulk of
manufacturing employment, and growth of informal
employment is usually due to new start-ups rather
than to the expansion of informal firms (Sandefur
2006). In such countries few informal enterprises
appear to graduate to formal status and of those that
do even fewer grow to become medium-size enterprises. Efforts to link the size of the informal sector
to business environment conditions – like the cost of
starting a business and enforcing a contract, and rigidity of employment laws – have found some association,
though it is clear that other factors, such as difficulty
in accessing credit and general macroeconomic conditions, also work to explain the size of informal activity.

4
Cost and supply-side structural change drivers

Several formal analyses of the performance of
SMEs have been conducted using detailed databases
compiled from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys.
Defining SMEs as formal sector enterprises up to 250
workers, Ayyagari, Beck and Demirguc-Kunt (2003)
found that in the sample of up to 76 countries for the
1990s manufacturing SMEs accounted for 32  percent of total employment for the low-income group,
compared with 54 percent for the middle-income and
64  percent for the high-income groups. Regression
analysis of these data (controlling for country characteristics and the starting level of per capita income)
finds that the size of the SME sector is positively associated with economic growth, though it does not support the interpretation that size causes higher growth.
It seems that in the 1990s a rising share of SMEs in
employment and income was a characteristic of fastgrowing economies.
The same database provides estimates of informal
unregistered economic activity, which shows a clear
tendency to decline as a share of national income as
economies grow. Thus the rising share of SMEs is
partly a result of declining informal activity, as previously unregistered firms shift into formal manufacturing. Perceived obstacles to the expansion of small
firms, like constrained access to credit and the costs of
starting a business, are associated with smaller shares
of SMEs in economic activity at the country level.
Across all countries, firm size is a significant determinant of employment growth and where there are
more SMEs, regressions suggest that there is higher
employment growth. Nurturing SMEs is conducive
to employment growth. There is a slight tendency for
this to be stronger at the smaller end of the SME scale
(up to 100 workers), but a dummy for the size group
101–250 is also significant. In countries with employment increases over the period covered by the surveys
the vast majority of new jobs are created by SMEs
(defined in the broadest way as up to 250 employees).
This negative association between size and employment growth holds even when controlling for the age
of firms, unlike a recent finding for the United States
(Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda 2010). Thus it is

Production fragmentation
Structural change is driven by the extent to which
firms can segment the production process and locate
production to minimize unit production costs.
Producing a final product in one location may offer
little scope for changing the capital–labour ratio. But
97

“

Product fragmentation through the

spread of global and domestic production
networks allows the retention of manufacturing
jobs in industry segments where such
jobs might otherwise have been lost

4
Cost and supply-side structural change drivers

once it becomes possible to fragment production into
a series of stages, some stages will inevitably be more
labour intensive than others and, with low transport
and communication costs, it may be cost-effective to
move these to a low-wage area.
The parts of the production process where wage
costs become the critical determinant of location are
simple assembly of parts or simple forms of product
processing, which are largely manufacturing by hand.
Assembly can relate to technologically simple products
like toys or sports goods and processing to the sewing
of materials for clothing. Highly sophisticated electronic products, such as iPhones, are also assembled
in low-wage areas (see The role of global value chains in
Chapter 5).
Over time with higher savings in these economies
the capital–labour ratio will rise again, and jobs will
move to locations with the lowest unit labour costs.
But in the short run the impact in depressing prices of
labour-intensive manufactures and in increasing competition among producers of such goods is substantial. Thus product fragmentation through the spread
of global and domestic production networks allows
the retention of manufacturing jobs in industry segments where such jobs might otherwise have been lost
through substitution through process innovation.
Spatial distribution and clustering
Structural change and the move from low to high tech
are driven by the way firms are distributed spatially
and able to collaborate and cluster. Geographical proximity between producers as a means of maximizing
spillovers and other external effects, like labour availability, has received prominence in discussions relating
to agglomeration effects and provides a rationale for
creating special economic zones and related measures
to encourage firms to cluster. A higher level of population density is positively associated with a higher level
of manufacturing employment for 15 of 16 industries
(see Figure 3.22 in Chapter 3). Key potential advantages for a firm being close to other producers are:
•	 Access to a pool of skilled labour drawn to the area
by the presence of similar firms.

98

•	 Spillovers though the sharing (or copying) of technological or marketing knowledge and the sharing
of access to equipment and other facilities.
•	 Joint learning and developing of innovations
through continuous interaction and working on
the same problem.
•	 Opportunities for jointly marketing products and
benefiting from buyers that can source all product
from one location.
•	 A network of specialist suppliers drawn to the area
by enough user firms near the suppliers to reduce
transport costs, to help ensure timely delivery and
to reduce coordination difficulties.
A distinction has been drawn between localization
(agglomeration) effects of clusters of similar producers
and urbanization effects of clusters of diverse producers. The hypothesis is that agglomeration effects are
more important for standardized and mature industries, while urbanization effects are more important
for newer industries where producers in different
subsectors but similar technological needs can benefit
from the dynamic environment created by a diversity
of activities (World Bank 2009).
In developed economies clusters of relatively
small firms have been at the forefront of some breakthrough technologies (Audretsch 2002). Many
small-firm innovations have been concentrated in
fairly narrow areas (such as those around Boston
and San Francisco in the United States). This tight
localization has been put down to the critical importance of tacit knowledge (see Box 4.3). Such an explanation for the United States has parallels in China,
the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China
and Thailand. But even in activities not highly innovative, small firms in some developing countries –
chiefly in Asia and Latin America – have found it
advantageous to group in clusters. Sectors include
footwear (Brazil and Mexico), metalworking, simple engineering and electronics (India), textiles
(India and the Republic of Korea), surgical goods
(Pakistan), furniture (Indonesia) and software development (India, Uruguay and more recently Kenya;
Weiss 2011).

“

Agglomeration effects associated with

clusters can be an important driver for
development and structural change in industry

case studies, Sonobe, Higuchi and Otsuka (2012)
regard a shortage of managerial capacity as one of the
distinguishing features of unsuccessful clusters, especially in Africa.
The conclusion is that agglomeration effects associated with clusters can be an important driver for
development and structural change in industry if the
manufacturing process can be segmented and if optimal low-cost production opportunities can be found
in different locations.
Business environment: a basic driver
for structural change
The business environment has been highlighted as a
key influence on enterprise growth and employment
– for example, by World Development Report 2005
(World Bank 2005). The investment climate has been
defined as “the many location-specific factors that
shape the investment opportunities and incentives for
firms to invest productively, create jobs and expand”
(World Bank 2005, p. 2). It covers aspects of regulation and corruption linked to the cost of doing business, as well as broad issues like the quality of infrastructure, the skill base, the difficulty of accessing
sources of finance and aspects of the labour market
– all crucial in low-income economies.
The effectiveness of the court system in enforcing
contracts is important, particularly once countries
reach a threshold per capita income. At lower incomes
where transactions may be less complex, a weak legal
system can be replaced by personal relationship-based
transactions that enable business development. But at
all country incomes it appears that risk of expropriation of a firm’s profits through informal payments and
bribes is a negative influence on growth.9 Small firms
have been found to be more hindered by regulations
than medium-size and large enterprises, for which
access to finance and good-quality infrastructure are
more important (Aterido, Hallward-Driemeier and
Pagés 2007).
Barriers to entry such as minimum capital
requirements, delays in obtaining permits and multiple procedures have been shown to have negative

4
Cost and supply-side structural change drivers

Empirical work reveals a raft of experiences among
10 clusters in low- and lower middle-income countries
(UNIDO 2009). Collaboration between firms varies
greatly from the casual exchange of tools and information to direct collaboration in sharing orders and
training. In some cases clear specialization emerges
with some firms as parts and components suppliers
to other cluster-based firms; in others growing firms
cease to rely on external suppliers and start to make
some of the components they need. In some clusters
social networks and cultural cohesion remain important; in others these are replaced by impersonal market relationships with external agents or traders stimulating links between firms.
Successful clusters allow small firms to expand
and increase employment and even larger and more
technologically sophisticated firms may benefit from
being in a cluster. Yet success depends partly on the
wider economic climate as well as firm-specific characteristics and the operating environment. In reviewing
the evidence on clusters in Africa, Dinh et al. (2012)
suggest that only the cluster in Mauritius has been
an unqualified success for employment and growth.
They highlight problems: targeting of inappropriate
activities for the cluster, poor choices of location, poor
infrastructure inside and outside the cluster, implementation difficulties and lack of long-term policy
credibility for continued support.
The success of special economic zones in East Asia,
particularly China, as an institutional arrangement to
support clusters has been well documented. But such
success with zones elsewhere has been mixed – especially disappointing in Africa. Sonobe and Otsuka
(2011), contrasting experiences in Africa and Asia,
find that Africa’s clusters are mainly “survival clusters” generating low incomes and lacking innovation
and dynamism. They suggest that successful clusters
are based on “multi-faceted innovation” that incorporates improvements in product quality, branding, use
of reliable input suppliers and effective distribution,
combined with an appropriate management system
to allow cluster-based firms to control stocks, labour
and financing. Developing the argument further using

effects on start-up numbers and productivity. They
are expected to have the most deleterious impact in
frontier sectors (where technological change is most
rapid) and in sectors where natural barriers to entry
(for example, due to initial investment requirements)
are relatively low (Djankov 2009). There is evidence
that modest changes to the business environment
have little impact on firm behaviour, particularly
in highly regulated environments, and that reforms
undertaken as a package have a stronger impact
than reforms undertaken independently or sequentially (Klapper and Love 2010). A common example
in the context of combining reforms relates to the
removal of the investment licensing system in India,
where a positive growth and employment effect was
only found in states with less restrictive labour markets (Aghion, Algan and Cahuc 2008; Aghion et al.
2008).
Poor infrastructure is a major constraint on
employment growth in low-income economies, particularly for export activities, as shown in a wide range
of survey data. Infrastructure can drive structural
change in industries through the costs they cause. But
in less developed countries it is simply the existence
(or absence) that shapes change in industries. From
surveys of firms in Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia and
Pakistan, measures of infrastructure (such as power
losses and days to install a telephone line) dominate
business environment indicators in an analysis of
firm performance (Dollar, Hallward-Dreimeier and
Mengistae 2005).
Recent analysis based on the large database created by the World Bank Enterprise Surveys reveals
that aspects of the investment climate are important
for employment growth across manufacturing firms in
different size categories and countries. Controlling for
these characteristics, Aterido and Hallward-Dreimeier
(2010) find that employment growth in low-income
countries is significantly related to reduced power
outages and access to finance. Measured corruption
and regulation (as proxied by management time spent
with officials) have no significant impact on industrial
development.

Dinh, Mavridis and Nguyen (2010) used the same
large database to assess the most binding constraint
on employment growth. They asked respondents to
rate different constraints on a scale of 1 (minor) to 4
(severe). Overall labour regulation appeared as only a
minor obstacle with electricity, taxation, corruption
and access to finance the most severe.10
In conclusion, while regulations and control may
impede growth in manufacturing in some circumstances, particularly in low-income Sub-Saharan
countries, they are less central than the quality of
infrastructure and the system of financial intermediation. More generally, governments, working
alongside the private sector, can help use key drivers, such as wages, technology, and education and
skills, to change manufacturing industry and so
boost employment generation while transforming
the economy.

Chapter 5

Trade and foreign direct investment as
external drivers of structural change
Trade in manufactured goods is a key driver of structural change through four mechanisms: revenues from
trade (generating resources for high-tech investments);
pressure from buyers (accelerating learning and productivity); access to technology; and imports of capital
goods.
But trade liberalization has not enhanced structural change in all regions: while East Asia has become
one of the most important manufacturing production
networks, aided by liberalization, Latin America has
seen deindustrialization and growth-reducing structural change in the 1990s and 2000s.1 In East Asia
industrial policies were key to transform opportunities coming from the global market into structural
change–driven industrialization. But as the outcome
of trade openness policies can be so different depending on the effectiveness of state intervention, a sample
of 44 countries on different continents offered only
modest empirical evidence of a strong relationship
between trade openness and structural change.
Trade openness is thus an opportunity – and a
threat for low-income countries. Excessive specialization in low-tech manufacturing may be a risk if these
countries have too much exposure to international
markets, which increases volatility of export revenues
and presents a consequent higher risk of non-sustained
growth. Countries with a diversified manufacturing
portfolio and the capacity to produce high-tech goods
with few competitors, reflecting a high level of past
structural change, are better equipped to absorb this
risk.
The impact of trade openness on employment
generation through manufacturing structural change
is mediated by two mechanisms: labour-saving techniques and the extent of mechanization of production
processes; and whether developing country exports
are facing demand from buying countries that cannot be sustained in the long run. But the negative
impact on employment of manufacturing structural
change based on labour saving or volatile demand can
102

be compensated for by industrial policies that achieve
one or more of the following: ensuring that output
growth in higher productivity sectors is strong enough
to make up for the downward effects of employment
growth; diversifying business activities towards more
(highly productive) sectors and thus broadening the
range and volume of total output; and leading to productivity changes that significantly stimulate local
economic activity through multiplier effects.
Global value chains (GVCs) now underpin international trade. A country’s production structure is
determined by its ability to join, stay part of or move
up GVCs, and technological upgrading is the best
long-term strategy for preserving a country’s participation in them. Still, despite growing product fragmentation and increasing international trade, the role of
GVCs may be narrower in the future because of physical limits to product fragmentation and transaction
costs.
Structural change can work to derail any “race to
the bottom”, where firms in rich countries are tempted
to relocate to low-income countries with lower labour
costs, less restrictive labour laws and weaker monitoring of labour conditions and environmental impacts.
Governments – especially in low- and middle-income
countries – should steer trade to stimulate productivity through knowledge diffusion, research and
development (R&D) and learning-by-doing spillover
effects. Bilateral investment treaties and multilateral
cooperation can help ensure that cross-border investment and trade are conducive to low-income countries
(see Chapter 9).
Finally, as with trade openness, foreign direct
investment (FDI) is not a one-way bet: it can be a major
force in promoting manufacturing structural change
through diversifying production and exports, generating spillovers, creating more backward and forward
linkages and improving local business conditions (see
Box 9.1 in Chapter 9). Yet only when it is properly integrated with local economies can they reap the benefits.

“

An increase of trade openness is a growth

opportunity for a country only if local resources
can be deployed in adequate quantities to
produce goods for the external market

who argued that that open trade regimes experienced
average annual growth about 1.5  percentage points
faster after than before liberalization, acknowledge
that trade openness works only if countries have the
right business conditions. Political stability, commitment to trade policies, the non-existence of counteractive policies and the right macroeconomic conditions
are all factors that may help make trade liberalization
a success. The creation and strengthening of institutions protecting property rights, maintaining macroeconomic stability, regulating market participants and
managing conflicts are also essential to boost technological upgrading and productivity (Rodrik 2001).
Ocampo and Taylor (1998) add that an increase of
trade openness is a growth opportunity for a country
only if local resources can be deployed in adequate
quantities to produce goods for the external market.
Domestic production capabilities have to be already in
place in order to respond to international competition,
improve technology and exploit trade opportunities
from increased liberalization.
In sum, the literature suggests that trade liberalization is not a precondition for structural change, and
that its impact depends on the economic context and
quality of industrial policies.

5
Trade and foreign direct investment as external drivers of structural change

Trade as a likely driver of structural
change
Demand for manufactured goods from advanced
countries represented the engine of growth in East
Asia and many other developing regions adopting an
export-led structural change approach. Expanding
trade increases business opportunities for low- and
middle-income countries. As pointed out by Freund
(2009), the elasticity of trade to income rose from 1.77
in the 1960s to 3.69 in the 2000s, but not all developing countries outside East Asia took advantage of the
market expansion.
Weiss (2005) suggested several factors conducive
to structural change based on trade openness:
•	 Manufactures face an initial stage of import substitution when domestic production can capture
the market served by imports.
•	 Growth of manufacturing output is more valuable
at the margin than the same growth of agriculture or services, due to externalities and dynamic
increasing returns to scale.
•	 Export-oriented growth may lead to further FDI
and growth.
•	 Exporting exposes firms to foreign competition,
technology and marketing, leading to productivity
gains that would not be obtained from sales on the
domestic market.
Trade in turn improves technology and productivity in four main ways. First, the increase in revenues
from trade integration induces exporters to upgrade
technology (Bustos 2011). Second, it exposes firms
to forms of competition not present in the domestic
market. Third, it improves quality standards and raises
the efficiency of production processes to international
levels as foreign suppliers exert pressure over domestic suppliers (Weiss 2005). Fourth, it provides access
to advanced capital equipment and R&D, and thus
knowledge, as modern technologies are produced by
a few developed economies. Empirical studies present
evidence of this (such as Coe and Helpman 1995).
But trade cannot be the only driver of structural
change, according to much theoretical work and anecdotal evidence. Even Wacziarg and Welch (2008),

When trade works
In 1960 the Republic of Korea was poorer than many
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It now leaves African
countries far behind. Most explanations of the wider
East Asian “growth miracle” stress export orientation and structural change towards high-tech exports,
which climbed steeply during 1985–1998 (Table 5.1).
Beyond trade openness, industrial policy also
played a crucial role in the East Asian miracle, steering structural change through manufactured exports.
Many governments in the region implemented policies to improve the competitiveness of firms and promote export-led growth. They provided credit through
state-supported banks, restricted competition from
imports, constrained new domestic competitors and
developed export-marketing institutions (Stiglitz and
Charlton 2006).

When trade does not work
Pieper (1998) argues that Brazil formally started
implementing trade liberalization policies in 1990.
Until then its manufacturing sector absorbed labour
with employment growth rates above the national
average at about 4  percent a year, associated with
negative annual rates of productivity growth. After
trade liberalization manufacturing stopped absorbing
labour, and gains in manufacturing productivity were
associated with overall growth stagnation.
Jobs released from the restructuring of industry
prompted by trade liberalization in Latin America
(and in Africa) created two different negative mechanisms. First, the excess labour was absorbed by lessproductive activities, such as agriculture and the
informal sector (or even fed into unemployment), and
for this reason the contribution of structural change
to productivity was negative (Figure  5.1). Second,
especially in poor countries, structural change often
moved activities towards sectors with a low labour
intensity (albeit with a high productivity) such as mining and quarrying. In poor countries with a mining
sector that has weak links to the rest of the economy,
few people are employed with very high labour productivity – labour productivity is 136 times larger in
mining than in agriculture in Malawi, for example
(McMillan and Rodrik 2011).
Cimoli and Katz (2003) argue that these factors, alongside undervalued exchange rates, may have

To garner some evidence about this complex relationship, data for the openness of trade in manufacturers
(expressed as the ratio between manufactured imports
and exports and GDP) and for structural change2
(expressed as the value added in high-tech manufacturing divided by the value added in medium-tech and
low-tech manufacturing) was plotted for 44 countries
for 1997 and 2007 (Figures 5.2–5.5). All figures are

divided into quadrants by a horizontal and a vertical
line representing the average structural change index
and the average trade openness index in the sample in 1997 and 2007 for four continents (Asia, the
Americas, Africa and Europe).
The relationship between trade openness and
structural change is in fact weak. A regression analysis
between structural change and trade openness with the
1997 and 2007 data revealed a statistically insignificant
relationship, even though the data suggested the existence of a positive correlation (0.17 in 1997 and 0.19 in
2007).3 Countries are scattered in all four segments of
the trade openness/structural change diagram.
The upper-left quadrant encompasses countries
that were successful in upgrading their economies
towards high-tech manufacturing and that are not
heavily exposed to trade in manufactures, as such
trade (exports plus imports normalized by GDP) represents a share of national GDP below the average.
This group includes the Republic of Korea (see Figure
5.2) and the United States (see Figure 5.3), with high
production of capital-intensive sectors and fairly low
exposure to trade openness.

Trade and foreign direct investment as external drivers of structural change

hamper growth and employment. The larger the share
of agricultural employment, for example, the larger the
opportunities for growth-enhancing structural change,
as many people can be shifted from lower to higher
productivity activities. Similarly, policies to overvalue
the exchange rate may also be beneficial, stimulating
export diversification and growth. Conversely, specialization in the production and export of commodities
does not represent an incentive to upgrade, while the
rigidity of the labour market reduces the absorption of
released labour when trade openness pushes non-competitive firms out of the market.

China during the 1980s encouraged by rising labour
and rent costs, Hong Kong SAR China still remains
an economy with prominent printing, food and textile industries within the manufacturing sector, even
though the services sector is now predominant in the
overall economy.
The lower-left quadrant brings together lowincome countries characterized by a low degree of
trade openness, reflected in economic isolation, and
low structural change. The countries in this group
include Ethiopia, Malawi and the United Republic of
Tanzania (see Figure 5.4). Their position in the lowerleft quadrant also reflects their low capacity to exploit
international business opportunities.
The upper-right quadrant includes Malaysia and
Singapore, which are highly exposed to trade openness
and have succeeded in upgrading their economies with
a very competitive high-tech industry (see Figure 5.2).
No Latin American countries upgraded their
industrial production despite the increasing trade
openness over time (see Figure 5.3). Among the
high-income countries, those in Southern Europe
such as Italy and Spain downgraded theirs to below

the average structural change index (see Figure 5.5).
Countries in Eastern Europe are quite varied, with
Poland and the Russian Federation having low trade
openness and low structural change, and the Czech
Republic and Hungary having high trade openness
and high structural change (see Figure 5.5).
Over 1997–2007 both the average structural
change index and trade openness index increased
(from 0.48 to 0.61 and from 0.52 to 0.61, respectively),
indicating that over 10 years the 44 countries became
more successful in implementing structural change
and on average more interconnected globally.
If the evidence on the relationship between structural change and trade openness is ambiguous, the
data are clearer in showing that excessive specialization in low-tech manufacturing may represent a risk
if countries are too exposed to the international market through trade. Concentration in a few categories
of manufactured goods (or commodities) increases
the volatility of export revenue and generates a higher
risk of stop-start economic growth. This latter risk
is reduced if countries have heavily changed their
structure, as countries producing goods with a high

technology content have less competition from global
producers and are more likely to be resilient to shocks
in manufacturing that could feed through to the rest
of the economy.
Countries with the highest export concentration
have the widest fluctuations in export revenue. They
are often least developed countries with a high dependency on commodities (Table 5.2). Countries unable to
diversify their economy towards greater technological
complexity are more likely to see economic instability.
With the “commodification” of low-tech manufactured goods, economies that do not upgrade industrial
production are more exposed to market fluctuations
than those relying on the production of high-tech
goods (Kaplinsky 1993).
Structural change and diversification are strongly
interconnected. Structural change improves both
the quality of goods and widens – or diversifies – the
product mix.
The potential for quality upgrading varies by
category. Agricultural and natural resources tend
to have lower potential for this than manufactures
(Papageorgiou and Spatafora 2012). For low-income
countries at early stages of development, expansion
to manufacturing may be a necessary first step to
secure the gains from quality improvement. Within
manufacturing, structural change takes place as
diversification from labour-intensive industries, such
as textiles and wearing apparel, to industries with
high skill, capital and technology intensity, such as
advanced machinery, automobiles and chemicals
(UNIDO 2012b).

Structural change of low-income countries towards
high-tech sectors may help curb the negative effects of
trade openness on employment and value added. This
is because in a globalized world trade openness may
lower manufacturing employment if developing countries suffer labour release (due to trade liberalization)
that the natural resources sector can only partially
absorb. And it may reduce value added if countries
cannot diversify into high-tech non-mining manufacturing sectors.
We find that countries with the lowest openness
to trade in manufactures and the highest structural
change broadly correspond to the group of countries
with the highest GDP per capita, such as Canada (see
Figure 5.3) and the United Kingdom (see Figure 5.5).
They are also the countries with the lowest GDP
growth fluctuations over the period. Countries
with high trade openness and low structural change
are those with the highest GDP growth volatility
(Table 5.3).
Among the group of countries with the highest
trade openness, those with higher structural change
show lower growth volatility. Countries with low
trade openness in manufactures and low structural
change have lower GDP growth volatility than countries with higher trade openness, but the difference
is narrow. This is partly because the group of countries with a low openness to trade in manufactures
and low structural change includes Kuwait, Malawi
and Oman, which are exposed to fluctuations of primary commodity markets (oil for Kuwait and Oman,
tobacco for Malawi).

Thus two lessons emerge from the coefficients of
variation for 1997–2007:
•	 Countries with the highest openness to trade in
manufactures experience the highest fluctuations
of GDP growth.
•	 Given a certain degree of openness to trade in
manufactures (high or low), higher structural
change helps stabilize economic performance.
Trade, structural change and employment
creation
The impact of trade-based industrial structural change
on employment is not straightforward. As discussed in
the previous chapter, manufacturing stimulates structural change and employment through productivity
growth, which is derived from specialization, learning
and agglomeration economies, as well as from economies of scale. As labour and capital move into higher
productivity activities, average productivity increases.
A more productive economy encourages additional
demand for services and industrial products, which
generates profitable investment opportunities and a
growing demand for labour (UNCTAD 2010a).

Two important mechanisms may, however, constrain employment generation (ILO 2012): laboursaving techniques and mechanization are increasingly becoming substitutes for human labour. Even in
developing countries endowed with abundant labour
relative to capital, technology transferred to them is
often labour saving as it reflects the market conditions
of technology-exporting advanced countries. Thus,
the opportunity to absorb labour in manufacturing
may be cut off prematurely (discussed in Skill-biased
technological change in Chapter 4). Further, structural
shifts have been based on export-led strategies and
continuing global demand, often bolstered by a rise in
debt in many developed nations, which is unsustainable in the long run.
To ensure that trade is positive for employment
generation, government policies will need to ensure
that:
•	 Output growth in the higher productivity sectors
is strong enough to make up for the downward
effect of productivity growth (UNCTAD 2010a).
•	 Diversification expands business activities of
developing countries towards high-productivity
sectors so that the scope and volume of output can
be increased.
•	 Changes of productivity stimulate local economic
activities through multiplier effects.
An increase of exports of developing countries may
stimulate direct effects (additional labour demand to
produce output), indirect effects (additional labour
demand for intermediate inputs) and induced effects
(additional production and labour deriving from the
increase of household spending). Chen et al. (2012)
report that for every $1,000 of Chinese total exports
in 2007, domestic value added estimated at $591 and
employment at 0.096 person-years (Table 5.4).

production costs. Thus product fragmentation has
local and global dimensions – this subsection focuses
on the global dimensions.
International trade has surged since the 1960s, far
outpacing growth in GDP and becoming more fragmented since the 1980s. Domestic content accounts
for only about half the total exports of the most
important manufacturing country, China, and even
less (18 percent) of its processed exports (Koopman,
Wang and Wei 2008). China’s exports in intermediate goods are growing faster than those of other Asian
countries, and China is emerging not only as the centre of production but also as a leading processing hub
in the region, being a prominent participant in global
value chains (see Figure 2.7 in Chapter 2). Developing
countries take advantage of GVCs because the increase
in demand for intermediate goods and services creates
opportunities for new firms and categories of workers to move into more complex and innovative activities (Sturgeon and Memedovic 2010). For this reason
trade in intermediate goods is usually considered a
110

good proxy for the size of GVCs. Global imports of
intermediate goods are stable at more than 50 percent
of the total (Figure 5.6).
Beyond traditional competitiveness drivers (production costs), a country’s competitiveness can now
be measured on its capacity to join, stay in and move
up a GVC (Box 5.1). Technological upgrading –
­characterized by dynamic movement along the value
chain towards production stages with higher growth
potential that leads to structural change improvements – represents the best long-term strategy for
protecting and promoting a country’s participation
in GVCs (Cattaneo et al. 2013). East Asian firms in
the apparel market upgraded along the GVC with
the shift from input assembly to original brand-name
manufacturing, where firms design and sell their own
branded products (Gereffi and Memedovic 2009).
But GVCs also pose challenges to firms in developing countries, the most important of which is that
trade is unlikely to maintain its dynamism, as there
are physical limits and transaction costs to product
fragmentation. Elasticity of trade to income seems to
have peaked in the 1990s (Table 5.5).

Value chains development as an effective policy tool for promoting inclusive and sustainable growth:
Malaysia’s palm oil value chain
(5–6 percent of the GDP) of which 84 percent is exported
for more than $18  billion (60  percent of the total export
earnings). Currently, more than 1.4  million workers are
engaged in the palm oil sector, or 8 percent of the working
population.
One of the biggest producers and exporters of palm
oil and palm oil products, Malaysia has an important role
in fulfilling the growing global need for oils and fats sustainably. With a head start of more than 100 years in the
oil palm business, Malaysia has a competitive advantage
and will continue to innovate with continuing support and
facilitation of agronomic research, technology transfer and
alliances with other centres of excellence to ensure the
industry’s sustainable development.
Malaysia – geographically small with scarce arable
land for new oil palm plantations – continues to increase
planter productivity and competitiveness through a
nationwide replacement of unproductive palms with highyielding hybrids. The exercise includes replanting on lands
owned by independent smallholders who contribute to
14 percent of the area under oil palm in Malaysia.
Malaysia’s example of supporting palm oil value
chains demonstrates how identifying and developing
value chains with high growth and employment potential
can be an effective policy tool for ensuring inclusive and
sustainable socioeconomic growth in the long run.

Trade and foreign direct investment as external drivers of structural change

International best practice shows, that the identification
of high-growth potential value chains and their promotion
can be a fundamental driver for inclusive and sustainable
growth.
In Malaysia the palm oil sector has notably contributed to the durable socioeconomic growth that over the
last 3 decades, with the generation of long-term jobs and
balanced revenue distribution, increased national valueadded and export revenues.
The rapid expansion of oil palm in the 1960s was
encouraged by Malaysia’s government, which recognized
its potential as a complementary crop to rubber.
“The oil palm is the world’s most efficient oil-­bearing
crop in terms of land utilization and productivity. A hectare
of cultivated oil palm land can supply about 10 and 5 times
more oil than a soybean or rapeseed hectare, respectively.
Whether further improvements occur in the agronomic
performance of the palm or the nutritional property of
palm oil, the crop’s future depends on innovation through
research and development” (May 2012).
The main palm product exported until the 1970s was
crude palm oil. At that time taxation and incentive policies
were introduced to encourage the export of refined palm
products.
Malaysia currently accounts for 39 percent of world
palm oil production and 44 percent of world exports. On
average, the country produces 25 tonnes of palm oil a year

Other issues are that product differentiation on
variety and quality matters less to non-high-income
consumers than price. Consequently, the usual intensity of standards (public and private) in GVCs is going
to be much less pronounced.4 And given that emerging economies often have a comparative advantage in
processing themselves, they will probably have a preference for importing relatively unprocessed products
and may thus limit upgrading options for low-income

countries that seemed to open up through the rise of
GVCs in the past. Two case studies – one for cassava in
Thailand and one for timber in Gabon – confirm that
a market shift from the European Union to China has
led to a decrease in the importance of standards and
lower value addition in source countries (Kaplinsky
and Farooki 2010).
Globalization may also cause global structural
change because of re-balancing. China and the United

Trade and foreign direct investment as external drivers of structural change

States account for huge shares of global imbalances.
There is widespread agreement that the current imbalances are unsustainable and that United States will
reduce imports while China will increase consumer
spending. As the import content and absolute value of
Chinese consumption is lower than that of US households, this could affect exports and growth in low- and
middle-income countries (UNCTAD 2010a; Mayer
2011).
For all these reasons implementing industrial policies to encourage firms to join, stay in and move up a
GVC is not easy (see Chapter 7). The wide dispersion
of productivity among businesses, the large number of
unsustainable micro-enterprises and the stagnation
of some larger firms suggest that the rapid growth of
transition economies and East Asian countries in past
decades will not be repeated in most developing countries (World Bank 2013a).
So, how do low-income countries take advantage
of GVCs? Steps include encouraging the highest integration possible between the business systems of the
low-income countries and the GVC; promoting traditional approaches (skill upgrading and vocational
training, improving the business environment and aid
for trade interventions for potential entrepreneurs in
developing countries); and tackling “spoilers” – operators who are reluctant to change (WEF 2013). These
operators include companies with high sunk costs or
that depend on supply-chain barriers (like goods or
services replaceable by alternative high-tech offerings).
These constraints and lack of coordination could all
hold back low- and middle-income countries from
advancing along GVCs. That would be a huge loss:
the 30 developing economies that successfully integrated in GVCs and showed the highest participation
rates grew almost five times faster than the 30 bottom
countries (UNCTAD 2013b).
Global value chains and technological
change
The spread of global production networks based on a
subdivision of the production process has had important implications for how technology is transferred

112

and applied in importing developing countries. The
technology transfer model of the 1960s and 1970s
involved either FDI or transfer of foreign technology
under licence. Technologically successful recipient
economies built up capabilities to apply, adapt and
modify foreign technologies, either in partnership
with foreign firms or by copying from them. National
support systems helped for R&D investment, training
and various forms of subsidy, particularly in the most
successful East Asian cases – the Republic of Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan Province of China.
The newer form of technology transfer based on
production networks has been termed technology
“lending”, with international firms providing their
technology to produce parts needed for other elements
of their global operations. In this interpretation industrialization has been made both “easier and faster” but
at the same time “less meaningful” (Baldwin forthcoming). Before the 1980s, export success required a
deep industrial base – a network of domestic suppliers and technological mastery. In the new era, firms in
developing countries can link to international production networks and draw on the technological and marketing prowess of the lead firms in these chains.
One crucial effect of the new system is that much
of the technology lent is specific to the lead firm and
has tight intellectual property protection to prevent imitation. So once firms in developing countries are committed to GVCs, they risk finding it far
harder than their predecessors in East Asia did to
move through the various stages of own equipment
manufacture. Their precursors worked with the lead
firm from design, to manufacturing with their own
designs, to finally breaking into world markets with
their own brand. Many observers, such as Kaplinsky
(2005), have commented on the risk that globalization
is creating a distinction between “headquarter economies”, where lead firms are based, where technology
originates and where manufacturing profits are high,
and “factory economies”, where there is little technical
innovation and where wages and profits are low.
In economies where this process of product fragmentation has played a major role, employment

Trade is likely to have a positive

impact on skilled labour but a negative
impact on unskilled workers

Impact of trade in manufactures on
employment quality
As seen at the start of this chapter, trade of manufactured goods may drive technological change and productivity. Economic theory postulates that productivity drives wages. So trade can improve employment

quality through the productivity effect. Endogenous
growth models providing theoretical foundations
have largely focused on two types of technological change: R&D and learning-by-doing spillover
effects (Grossman and Helpman 1991; Romer 1990;
Box 5.2).
The literature has empirical evidence supporting
the argument that trade improves skills and productivity through knowledge diffusion. Brazil started
to liberalize trade in the 1990s, and exports and
imports grew after 2000. Over the same period relative demand for skilled labour increased substantially.
Technological transfer from richer countries upgraded
the skills of Brazilian manufacturing firms (Araújo,
Bogliacino and Vivarelli 2009).
Trade is likely to have a positive impact on skilled
labour but a negative impact on unskilled workers.
Evidence from six manufacturing sectors in Tunisia
shows that unskilled workers are vulnerable to trade as
they face increasing competition in the output market.
Skilled labour is better positioned because the increase
in market opportunities in skill-intensive markets
derived from additional trade openness outweighs
substitution possibilities for this category of worker
(Mouheli and Ghazali 2012).
Rodrik (1997) identifies three main impacts of liberalization on the international labour market. First,

5
Trade and foreign direct investment as external drivers of structural change

growth in export manufacturing is likely to have contributed to rising inequality due to a relative rise in
the demand for skilled labour (as discussed above). In
developed economies the offshoring of lower productivity tasks raises the possibility of higher wages for
the remaining jobs in manufacturing as the average
productivity of those workers remaining in employment increases, again widening wage differentials with
the rest of the economy.
Trade, particularly through the import of goods
that embody new skill-intensive technologies, appears
to have played an important role in increasing income
inequality by raising the relative wage of skilled workers and increasing the premium attached to further
education. Importantly, however, the relation between
trade and inequality holds for trade between middleincome technology-importing countries and highincome countries, but not for trade between lowincome countries and high-income countries nor for
trade between low-income countries as a group.

Box 5.2	
Research and development and learning-by-doing spillover effects from trade
Coe and Helpman (1995) provide a theoretical and empirical background on the relationship between trade and
spillovers. They estimate that foreign research and development has beneficial effects on domestic productivity,
and that these are stronger the more open an economy is
to foreign trade. Developing countries will be able to enjoy
technology spillovers based on their capability to absorb
technological change. Short geographical distance, short
technological distance (expressed as a similar distribution
of patenting among different technologies) and linguistic and trade-bloc relations all encourage technological
transfer. The flow of knowledge is more likely to occur
between leader innovators (Verdolini and Galeotti 2011).
The notion of learning by doing derives from the concept of the “learning curve”, which reflects the observation

that with greater “experience” (cumulative production)
there is a decline in the unit costs of new technologies
(Arrow 1962). Trade also stimulates learning by doing, and
most of the technical and managerial innovations made
in high-income countries may be adopted by low-income
countries (Young 1991). The positive externalities of cost
discovery are also important, especially for entrepreneurs.
If a project is successful, other entrepreneurs learn that
they can make the product. In this way benefits to the first
mover spread to the overall industry (Hausmann, Hwang
and Rodrik 2006). This imitation process may help lowincome countries transition to higher value-added sectors
and increase their demand for skilled labour.

As with trade, FDI does not automatically

generate growth and beneficial structural change

Trade and foreign direct investment as external drivers of structural change

workers in the North have to accept lower labour
standards and benefits, given poorer wages and conditions in competing countries (the race to the bottom). Second, greater openness leads to a more volatile
labour market, which widens wage inequalities within
groups and increases insecurity among workers. Third,
given that workers are substitutable, the bargaining
power of trade unions declines.
The effect of the race to the bottom is seen in
the Global Wage Report 2010–2011 (ILO 2011b). It
shows a decrease of the manufacturing wage share over
1990–2007 – that is, before the global financial crisis,
as wages rose less quickly than manufacturing value
added (profits rose more quickly; Figure 5.7).
The race to the bottom would be unlikely ever
to lead to positive structural change, except in those
countries where low-productivity, low-wage jobs represent the only alternative to unemployment. But some
low-income countries could take advantage of the
race. In recent decades Asian countries have increased
their share of world merchandise exports to more than

30 percent, attracting employment by offering a more
competitive business environment such as through
lower wages, while other countries (including those in
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa) were unable to
raise their merchandise export share, which remained
below 5  percent (Figure  5.8). However, China’s rising wages could help Sub-Saharan Africa increase its
manufacturing jobs. Lin (2011) argues that China
will free up 85 million labour-intensive manufacturing jobs, compared with Japan’s 9.7  million in the
1960s and the Republic of Korea’s 2.3 million in the
1980s, due to wage increases in the coming years.
Africa, the continent with the lowest GDP per capita,
has only around 10 million manufacturing jobs and
could thus gain from changes in China’s wages and
competitiveness.

structure of an economy generally and manufacturing
particularly in various ways. Evidence shows that FDI
is often strongly related to export gains, and supports
a positive correlation between the stock of FDI in the
tradable sector and the export–GDP ratio (Kinoshita
2011). Countries with a high FDI stock–GDP ratio
are also those with the highest foreign value added in
exports, GVC participation rate and contribution of
value-added trade to GDP (UNCTAD 2013b).
These correlations translate into structural change
if exports stimulated by FDI change the production
composition and the technological intensity of production. The impact of economic diversification on
long-run productivity crucially depends on the technology segment or the GVC stage receiving the investments (or both). Countries receiving FDI in high- and
medium-tech sectors are more likely to boost productivity in the long run (for some Eastern European
countries, see Damijan, Kostevc and Rojec 2013).
Domestically oriented FDI may also help enhance
structural change as it may fill expectations of demand
increase, as in Viet Nam in the 1990s when domestic
firms did not have the capacity to produce efficiently

in the FDI-targeted sectors (Schaumburg-Müller
2002).
FDI may also affect structural change through
other mechanisms:
•	 By strengthening competition and weakening oligopoly/monopoly elements. Increasing competition
may stimulate structural change through a direct
or indirect effect: directly, market restructuring
makes firms more efficient since more efficient
firms have more revenues to spend to upgrade business activities; indirectly, a competitive market
helps to create a favourable business environment
(Moose 2002).
•	 By diffusing knowledge of new production processes.
Local firms may benefit through learning by
watching, labour mobility, backward and forward
linkages and relocation of R&D activities (Zhao
and Zhang 2006). Additionally, FDI may be a
means to transfer managerial know-how from foreign to local firms; vertical spillovers in the supply
chain are more effective than horizontal spillovers;
and managerial spillovers may spread intentionally (through demonstrations) or unintentionally
(through relationships with business partners; Fu
2009).
•	 By stimulating the entry of firms in other sectors (horizontal linkages). They create business
opportunities for local entrepreneurs (by creating demand for local products and services) or
upstream/downstream activities (vertical linkages;
Ayyagari and Kosová 2006).
•	 By creating the right conditions to enhance structural change. FDI may improve conditions in the
financial market. With a direct channel, FDI helps
correct capital-market failure; with an indirect
channel, FDI may help strengthen stock market
indicators (Soumaré and Tchana 2011).
Much evidence supports the positive relationship
between FDI, growth and employment. IFC (2013)
finds that over the last decade the rate of growth of
FDI-related employment (28  percent) has outpaced
growth of the global labour force (16 percent), indicating a growing importance of FDI in job creation.

FDI is not a “silver bullet”. While it is often

spillovers to local economic development do

5
Trade and foreign direct investment as external drivers of structural change

The World Investment Report 2013 finds a strong and
positive relationship between FDI and GDP growth
(UNCTAD 2013b).
Despite this evidence FDI is not a “silver bullet”.
While it is often linked to growth of capital and technology, spillovers to local economic development do
not always spread to the whole economy. For example,
countries with rich natural resources but low quality
of governance rarely show structural change (te Velde
2006), a point underlined in Table  5.6: Africa and
least developed countries with the lowest GDP per
capita have the biggest share of FDI in the primary
sector (UNCTAD 2013b) – where backward and forward linkages are typically very weak.
Honing in on a single country, in Costa Rica over
1997–2005 foreign investment in offshoring activities
contributed to the expansion of skilled, productive
and well-paying jobs, reflecting business by Intel and
other high-tech companies. But offshoring activities
did not integrate well with the overall economy, particularly manufacturing – and such integration is key
to maximizing FDI’s beneficial impact on growth and
employment (Ernst and Sánchez-Ancochea 2008).
Large, newly established and highly productive
domestic firms seem more likely to benefit from FDI
(Amendolagine et al. 2013). This means that FDI
often provides most benefits to highly productive
firms rather than to those needing to upgrade through
technology, thus increasing inequality and offering
little impact on structural change. So, for technology

transfer to trickle down to domestic firms through
FDI, governments need to promote local firms that
can initially adopt and adapt technology from FDI,
and support the development of domestic production
linkages and networks, in which initial adopters play
a conduit role in disseminating the foreign technology
vertically and horizontally to related firms.
Notes
1.	 In this chapter we use trade liberalization, trade
openness and export orientation almost as synonyms. Some analysts question whether East Asian
countries really liberalized and increased trade
openness as they adopted trade protectionist
measures, and for this reason they prefer to call
them export oriented. Trade openness is a broader
concept than trade liberalization as it incorporates liberalization of FDI, remittances and the
wider financial market. As the most common
measure of trade openness (ratio of exports plus
imports to GDP) and the scientific and policy
debate do not always capture these nuances, we
prefer to acknowledge this distinction but use
these terms interchangeably.
2.	 For simplicity and for consistency with the rest of
the report we call this index “structural change”,
even though it represents the orientation of the
manufacturing production towards high-tech
sectors (stock variable) rather than properly structural change (flow variable). The two variables are

Chapter 6

Structural change and
manufacturing employment in a
resource-constrained world
Sustainable development rests on economic development, social advancement and environmental protection. The concept has been ensconced in policy for
decades, but translating it into action remains a challenge, which for industry means producing goods and
services that do not harm the natural environment
but that improve living standards. The paradigm of
continually increasing demand for finite resources to
support economic growth, alongside worsening environmental degradation, must be shifted in the coming
years.
The rate of this demand increase may well be
set to rise too, with the rapid expansion of emerging markets and an estimated additional 3  billion
middle-class consumers in the next 20 years (Kharas
2010). In recent years global material consumption has grown at around 3  percent a year, and so
by 2050 could reach 140 billion tonnes of minerals,
ores, fossil fuels and biomass a year, or about three
times current levels (UNEP 2011a). In addition, this
soaring demand takes place at a time when accessing
and processing most of those resources has become
more challenging and expensive (Dobbs et al. 2011).
Wasteful production and consumption patterns –
along with continuing soil degradation, deforestation and overfishing – will result in increasing water
shortages and escalating prices for food, energy and
other commodities (ILO 2012). And along with
climate change, they are increasingly constraining
production. Environmental change is likely to accelerate in the coming decades, no doubt affecting the
underprivileged the most, as they depend the most
on environmental capital and have the least means
to adapt.
Resource efficiency thus has not been a major
driver of structural change in the past – but must be so
in the future. The paradigm of resource-intensive and
highly polluting economic development is being questioned. Some scholars argue that green-sensitive ideas
may well cause a slowdown in the rate of structural
118

change and thus on employment. In this vein Dercon
(2012) posits that environmental constraints may
change the patterns of structural change with employment and distributional effects that will not lead to
sustained economic growth. The argument holds from
the perspective of internalization of environmental
externalities.
But efforts to promote resource efficiency find
themselves at the intersection of economic, employment and environmental policies. “Decoupling” natural resource use and environmental impacts from
economic activity is a concrete means to reconcile
the policy imperatives of economic growth, and thus
employment and environmental protection. Indeed,
increased resource productivity lifts competitiveness,
especially as resources often represent a significant
share of production costs, especially in developing
countries. It also supports employment, and undoubtedly alleviates the burden on the environment.1
Green structural change – a move to green
industry – will involve shifting to industries more
technologically advanced and with higher labour
and capital productivity, while improving resource
productivity as a means of both boosting competitiveness and protecting the environment. Past abundance of relatively inexpensive natural resources,
such as energy, water and materials, is coming to
an end, and industries will need to restructure with
demand for environmentally damaging goods falling and for environmentally preferable goods rising.
Green structural change will be influenced by factors
related to resource constraints and environmental
protection, as well as other cost and environmental
considerations. As manufacturing industries tend to
be resource intensive, cost considerations will focus
on increasing resource productivity. Environmental
considerations will arise from consumers looking for
environmentally friendly products or from governments aiming to reduce the environmental footprint
of human activity.

Reconciling the legitimate aspirations for a

better life with environmental protection requires
a paradigm shift that decouples economic activity
from resource use and environmental impact

Industrial greening: an
emerging driver
UNIDO refers to “green industry” as a pattern of
industrial production and development that does not
come at the expense of the health of natural systems
and does not lead to adverse human health outcomes.
It consists of an industrial system that does not require
an ever-growing use of natural resources and pollution
to fuel societal progress (Box 6.1).

Such a change is needed. In the recent past the
abundance of relatively inexpensive natural resources,
such as energy, water and materials, spurred economic
development. The material throughput of the global
economy and environmental pollution has followed
similar trends (Figure 6.1). But there are strong indications that this era is coming to an end, given increasing competition for resources. Also, from an environmental perspective, “planetary boundaries” are being
overstepped (Rockström et al. 2009).

Structural change and manufacturing employment in a resource-constrained world

Reconciling the legitimate aspirations for a better life with environmental protection requires
a paradigm shift that decouples economic activity from resource use and environmental impact.
Opportunities for decoupling will arise for enterprises as they adapt to new prices and scarcities and
as they get involved in new businesses that commercialize green goods and services, such as equipment for
recycling or renewable energy, or specialized consulting services. Bettering resource efficiency will be the
driver of green structural change underpinned by the
uptake of new green technologies and a growing trade
in environmental goods.
And green jobs will be created, arising from investments in the areas of renewable energy, industrial
energy efficiency, waste management and recycling,
environmental services and, most important, new
green technologies and products as countries move up
the productivity and technological ladder.

Box 6.1	
Green economy and green industry
A green economy results in “improved human well-being
and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities” (UNEP 2010).
Closely related, “green industry” is a concept to address
global, interrelated challenges through a set of immediately actionable cross-cutting strategies that take
advantage of market forces and emerging industries. It
contributes to a model of development that considers
resource constraints and the earth’s carrying-capacity
limits.
Developing and transition countries have huge potential for pursuing green industry further – they are already

making heavy public and private investments to improve
resource productivity and reduce environmental impact
(in one of the worst manifestations, pollution) and securing the associated benefits of improved competiveness,
employment and environmental conservation.
Green structural change reflects the growing importance of shifting towards sectors – and within them,
activities­– that efficiently use not only capital and labour
but also natural resources to minimize environmental
impact.

are constraining industrial production, leading to

Structural change and manufacturing employment in a resource-constrained world

This shift towards higher productivity and
greener industries will entail economic restructuring. An overall increase in resource productivity and
a decline in manufacturing’s intensity of pollution
– other things being equal – would be key characteristics of green structural change. But for now
material use and socioeconomic development are
intertwined, to some degree at least: countries with
the highest per capita manufacturing value added
are those with the highest domestic material use
(Figure  6.2). Still, material consumption has been
increasing globally over the past few decades more
slowly than GDP in all major regions of the world
– that is, productivity of material use is increasing
(Dittrich et al. 2012).
Increased demand and investment in greener
products and services, as well as the equipment and
infrastructure to produce them, will expand certain industries and enterprises (ILO 2012). This
will translate into higher labour demand and job
creation (direct effect), mainly in green sectors (see
Green manufacturing jobs below). In addition, due to
inter-industry relations of the expanding industries,

other parts of the economy that supply inputs to the
expanding green sectors will also benefit, creating
additional employment (indirect effect), including
employment in non-green sectors such as cement for
green buildings or steel and carbon fibre for the blades
and towers of wind turbines. The income generated
by this additional economic activity is redistributed
by spending on additional consumption and investment across the economy, creating further employment (induced effects), in addition to the direct and
indirect jobs.
Factors at play
The empirical evidence is becoming more persuasive
that resource scarcity and environmental factors are
constraining industrial production, leading to adjustments at the enterprise and sector levels to deal with
resource-related risks and opportunities (Dobbs et
al. 2011). Job opportunities, especially those of the
underprivileged, may decline if economic growth is
constrained by physical or economic shortages (EU
2012).
The response – green structural change – is thus
influenced by factors related to resource constraints
and environmental protection, as well as to other
external factors, classified as cost and environmental.
Cost considerations may well trigger a shift
from resource- and pollution-intensive sectors,
but independently from considerations related
to resource conservation and environmental protection. As manufacturing industries tend to be
resource intensive, greater resource productivity is
a key factor in competitiveness in its own right. For
their part, environmental concerns will stimulate
increased resource productivity in industrial activities and reduce their environmental impact. They
can trigger a self-induced structural shift towards
greener manufacturing, to respond to increasing
customer demand for resource-efficient products,
for example. Or they can be prompted by targeted
policy and regulatory interventions, such as phasing
out subsidies for fossil fuels or banning incandescent light bulbs.

For sustainable industrial development,

industrial structure has to change towards
a direction that decouples economic activity
from resource use and environmental impact

Decoupling
For sustainable industrial development, industrial
structure has to change towards a direction that decouples economic activity from resource use and environmental impact (Figure 6.3).
Decoupling may be viewed as relative, where
production rises but the increase in resource use and
environmental impact does not rise as quickly – and
as absolute, where production can increase while

resource use and environmental impact fall. The world
economy has already achieved a relative decoupling,
extracting around 40  percent more economic value
from each tonne of raw material than three decades
ago. Still, these gains have been swamped by economic growth of 150  percent over the same period
(Hinterberger et al. 2013).
Even though an abundant literature stresses that
environmental protection bears a cost, a parallel literature has emerged showing that green measures
can provide economic and social benefits, including
von Weizsäcker et al. (2009), who argue that gains
in resource productivity in several economic sectors
can lead to an 80 percent reduction of environmental impacts per unit of economic output. Similarly
Dobbs et al. (2011) observe that up to 30 percent of
the resource demand in 2030 could be addressed
by resource-productivity opportunities – and thus
avoided in absolute terms.
Since the 1990s an academic discussion has
emerged around the hypothesis of the “Environmental
Kuznets Curve” (EKC). 2 In this, the environmental
impact first increases until reaching a given level of

6
Structural change and manufacturing employment in a resource-constrained world

Straddling the two sides are cases when the environmental burden has an internalized cost. Decreasing
the cost of managing waste is best achieved by avoiding waste in the first place. Also, non-compliance with
environmental regulations – when enforced – can
have financial and operational consequences, including sanctions.
Adapting manufacturing capacity to this evolving
context translates into two elements: reorienting existing industries towards greener resources, processes,
practices and products; and creating green industries
(UNIDO 2011c).
The first element entails improving production
efficiency, by using resources more efficiently and
optimizing the productive use of natural resources;
minimizing environmental impact by reducing the
generation of waste and emissions and promoting
the environmentally sound management of residual
wastes; and minimizing health risks by managing
chemicals safely.
The second reflects environmental technologies
and services originating from the transition to a green
economy, including companies that develop, manufacture and install clean technologies for industrial,
transport, buildings and automotive sectors. They
also cover service industries, including materialrecovery companies, recycling companies and waste-­
management,  -treatment and  -transport companies.
Other examples are engineering companies specializing in wastewater treatment, air pollution control
and the manufacture of waste treatment equipment,
as well as companies providing monitoring, measurement and analytical services.

economic activity, before gradually decreasing by itself
as economies mature (Azar, Holmberg and Karlsson
2002). The hypothesis is based on four assumptions
(Stamm et al. 2009).
First, there is a tendency for the values to shift
from welfare based on quantitative satisfaction
towards higher preferences for environmental quality. Better educated and informed agents tend to
be more likely to take the environmental externalities into account before consuming, thus providing
an incentive for manufacturers to adapt production
patterns accordingly (Inglehart 1977). Second, as an
economy develops, the composition of value addition
changes, changing the pattern of resource use and
environmental impact (Pasinetti 1983). Third, institutions in higher income countries are more inclined
to internalize environmental externalities and provide adequate incentives. Fourth, more advanced and
sophisticated businesses tend to apply technological
innovations in production. Whether introduced to
spur productivity or based on environmental concerns, these innovations often raise resource productivity and lower the intensity of environmental
impact.
A vast body of work has tested this EKC hypothesis. Some studies have corroborated the existence of
an EKC-like relationship with local pollutants, such
as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (Stern 2004),
though the empirical evidence demonstrating the
prevalence of EKC for other environmental indicators
and at a broader scale is “scant, fleeting and fragile”
(Carson 2010).
But even assuming that an EKC exists, passively
waiting for the hypothetical turning point is no
option, as it could coincide with a global level of pollution beyond the abortive capacity of the biosphere
(Stamm et al. 2009). Also, the link between income
and environmental impact at country level is blurred,
due to the huge increase in international trade. Indeed,
consumption might be delinked from production in a
given country (Panayotou 2000).
The key thus lies in decoupling natural resource
use and environmental impacts from economic

activity. In such a way, aspirations for better socioeconomic conditions can be reconciled with the finite
nature of natural resources and the need to protect
the environment. This huge shift will require drastic
structural changes, affecting employment positively
(through opportunities for green jobs) as well as less
benignly.
The opportunities will stem from two areas of
adjustment. First, existing enterprises will need to
adapt to the new circumstances, whether caused by
more expensive raw materials or by policy incentives
and disincentives, and so will require new skill sets
and experience. Second, greener manufacturing will
create a range of opportunities for businesses that
commercialize green goods and services such as equipment for recycling or renewable energy, or specialized
consulting services.
Some subsectors will undoubtedly see job losses,
though the number should be manageable and small
relative to shifts produced by other factors such as
globalization or movement between enterprises (ILO
2012). Firms in more resource- or energy-intensive
activities will no doubt lose competitiveness as well,
but this is all the more reason for them to be looking forward. The same argument holds at the macroeconomic level. Countries improving competitiveness through measures to achieve greater resource
efficiency will be well positioned in a resource-constrained global economy: Figure  6.4 suggests that
countries with lower energy intensive industry tend to
add more value – and vice versa.
Countries that focus on moving towards cleaner
and more sustainable industries have numerous fieldproven instruments. At their core, strategy-planning,
goal-setting and benchmarking have proved useful in
identifying potential improvements. Benchmarking,
which can raise awareness of resource productivity
(or its lack), provides a tangible way to determine the
resource or energy efficiency of a system, whether a
process, company or nation. It compares actual energy
and resource use against best available practice.
Despite the seemingly clear case for resource
efficiency­– environmentally or economically – major

barriers remain to pushing through concrete measures.
Central is access to financing. Many enterprises in
developing countries, particularly small and mediumsize ones, struggle to finance gains in resource productivity and environmental performance. These investments are crucial to any government strategy aimed at
promoting industrial development, especially as small
and medium-size enterprises often form the backbone
of developing economies.
Resource efficiency as a driver of
manufacturing structural change
Resource efficiency is the ratio between resources
required and desired output. So resource productivity can be defined as the efficiency with which
energy or materials are used to produce a given output. Increasing resource efficiency is appealing from a
number of viewpoints: economic, given that resources
often loom large in many developing countries’ manufacturing output costs; and environmental, as fewer
inputs should mean less pollution and less contamination from wastage.

One school of thought draws attention to the
potential negative impacts of restrictions on resource
use and pollution on firms’ competitiveness, arguably
jeopardizing jobs. Morgenstern, Pizer and Shih (2002)
analysed job dynamics in four heavily polluting industries in the United States (pulp and paper mills, plastic manufacturers, petroleum refiners, and iron and
steel mills) and found that increased environmental
spending generally did not cause a significant drop
in employment. If anything, the change tended to be
positive.
There is ample empirical evidence demonstrating the positive influence of more efficient resource
use on economic performance. For a sample of ISO
14001 certified companies in South-East Asia, Rao
and Holt (2005) modelled the link between green
supply-chain management practices and increased
competitiveness on the one hand and improved
economic performance on the other. They found
a positive correlation between those dimensions.
Similarly, Ilinitch and Schaltegger (1995) demonstrated that positive environmental performance

Steep gains in resource efficiency

require dedicated actions

Structural change and manufacturing employment in a resource-constrained world

could be associated with neutral or positive economic performance, in contrast to the often asserted
negative effects.
Steep gains in resource efficiency require dedicated
actions. Indeed, even in world regions characterized
by limited economic growth and advanced innovation systems, signs of effective decoupling are feeble, perhaps due to the “rebound effect” (Sorrell and
Dimitropoulos 2008). This refers to the behavioural
or other systemic responses to the introduction of new
technologies that increase the efficiency of resource
use, thus potentially offsetting the benefits of the
measures taken.
What some argue for is thus a qualitative leap in
resource productivity, particularly in economies with
high growth and weaker innovation. Huber (2000)
looks to transformational, as opposed to incremental, changes in industrial structures, which would
require a shift from the predominant policy focus
on improvement of labour and capital productivity
towards resource productivity (see also Hinterberger
et al. 2013).
By the mid-1990s thought leaders had already
developed such a vision of drastic change. The
“Factor 4” strategy outlined a world with double the
wealth using half the natural resources in the coming
decades (von Weizsäcker, Lovins and Lovins 1997).
Based on this, and examining innovation in industry, the subsequent Factor Five described how to roll
out measures leading to 80 percent improvements in
resource and energy productivity, with a massive boost
in wealth for billions of people (von Weizsäcker et al.
2009).
Uptake of green technology
Technology will be essential in decoupling economic growth from the burdens on the environment.
Ocampo (2011) stresses that the green transition
entails a technological revolution, with fundamental
impacts on production structures and consumption
patterns. Yet technological change rarely takes place in
a vacuum, and often requires incentives. Success stories
of widespread penetration of new energy technologies

124

are the product of forward-thinking, ambitious government policies.
Bursts of innovation are associated with cyclical
economic development (Freeman and Perez 1988).
From this perspective, Rifkin (2011) argues that we
are entering an area of innovations related to sustainability, paving the way towards the “next great economic era” (Figure 6.5).
A logarithmic mean Divisia index technique is
applied to investigate the green technological uptake
using carbon dioxide emissions reduction as a proxy
of environmental impact. Using the I = PAT model,
where the human impact on the environment is
assumed to be a function of the population, economic
activity (affluence) and technology, it is possible to calculate to what extent the variation of manufacturing
carbon dioxide emissions depends on the variation of
emission intensity, energy productivity, value added
per capita and population:

Ei,t = Popi,t *

MVAi,t Eneri,t
Ei,t
*
*
Popi,t
MVAi,t Eneri,t

,

where E represents manufacturing carbon dioxide
emissions, MVA is manufacturing value added, Pop is
total population and Ener is manufacturing energy.
The calculation was applied to 45 countries with
data on all these variables over 2001–2010, and
Figure 6.6 shows the outcome of the decomposition
of manufacturing carbon dioxide emissions. Global
manufacturing carbon dioxide emissions rose 40 percent. The decomposition indicates that at the global
level all components – population, value added per
capita, energy intensity and emissions intensity
– contributed positively to that increase. By contrast, considering high-income countries separately,
where manufacturing emissions fell 11 percent, all
determinants contributed to the decrease with the
notable exception of population, which is inversely
correlated.
In Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China
and South Africa (BRICS) where manufacturing
emissions rose 109 percent, the emission intensity
rose only slightly while energy intensity declined a

little. Interestingly, the increase in manufacturing
value added per capita explains most of the increase in
emissions, reflecting the shift in materials production

to developing countries, particularly to the BRICS
(Banerjee et al. 2012). As far as low-income countries
are concerned, where carbon dioxide manufacturing emissions climbed 16  percent, the decomposition indicates that much of that increase is due to
increased manufacturing activity and a rising population. The emission intensity of manufacturing energy
fell sharply, a trend that can be interpreted as a sign
of gains in manufacturing processes and greater use of
green technology.
Low-income countries account for a small share
of global emissions, though the likely growth of their
economic activity will no doubt add to emissions,
offset to a degree (on the current pattern) by the
uptake of green technology. Applying the “best available technologies” as industries develop represents a
unique opportunity for low-income countries. Large
investments, particularly in heavy machinery, have
an impact over several decades, as switches of existing
plant are few and refurbishing costly. So cleaner technologies offer promising prospects to boost industry’s
competitiveness in these countries.
For green structure change, knowledge and
innovation – including technologies – represent key

assets. Schumpeter identified innovation as the critical dimension of economic change (Pol and Carroll
2006). Recent changes in intellectual property rights
are due to the increase of cross-border exchanges in
terms of goods and services, but also to structural
changes in economies, with knowledge becoming an
important tradable asset (Curtis 2012).
With intellectual property rights associated with
private sector investment, strengthening such regimes
would imply greater opportunities for firms to compound their position (Lesser 1998). But some studies
indicate that developing countries with low human
capital might not benefit from strengthening intellectual property rights (Bravo-Ortega and Lederman
2010). Indeed, such action could have a negative
effect on domestic innovation, particularly where
it is mostly based on imitation or adaptive in nature
(Schneider 2005).
In the next few decades governments in all
countries will need to carry out policies to continue
strengthening green technological change by encouraging profitable opportunities as industries go green
(UNIDO 2011b).

Trade and green structural change
All major world regions already export environmental
goods (Figure 6.7), demonstrating the ready market
for such products. As an illustration, about 9 percent
of the retail price of high-efficiency refrigerators in
Spain can be considered a price premium, representing
a third of the cost of saved energy over the appliance’s
life (Galarraga, Heres and Gonzalez-Eguino 2011).
An expanded environmental market could generate
international spillovers by reducing production costs
for low-income countries exporting to high-income
economies (Cantore 2009).
Under the global regime for mitigating climate
change, industrialized countries are bound to targets
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, theoretically
enabling developing countries to grow in two ways
(Gerlagh and Kuik 2007): a reduction of fossil fuel
demand in high-income countries cuts the global price
of energy, raising demand for energy and thus growth
in developing countries; or environmental policies in
high-income countries encourage industries to relocate to developing countries, where constraints are
looser.

Structural change towards a service-

focused society, as in industrialized
countries, does not necessarily imply a
global reduction of resource use

activity of the producing country. This has obvious
implications for the political economy of environmental protection, as current regimes in the realm of climate change are based on production-based environmental impact.
Green manufacturing jobs
An approach rather than a definition
Green jobs have no single and universally accepted
definition, although typical characteristics are that
they reduce consumption of energy and raw materials;
limit greenhouse gas emissions; minimize waste and
pollution; protect and restore ecosystems; and enable enterprises and communities to adapt to climate
change (ILO 2013).
The quality of employment often features, and
the literature frequently incorporates, social considerations such as “decent work” (Renner, Sweeney and
Kubit 2008, for example). Such considerations involve
opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social
protection for families, better prospects for personal
development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns and organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives, and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and
men (ILO 2013).
Some commentators distinguish between green
jobs and environment-related employment. Varma
(2010) argues that to be called green, environmentrelated jobs must meet acceptable standards on
wages, gender and working conditions, and suggests
that green jobs account for only about a quarter of
all environment-related jobs.3 But as Pollin (2009)
has noted, an absence of a clear-cut definition
should not stand in the way of actions to promote
green jobs.

6
Structural change and manufacturing employment in a resource-constrained world

Reduced emissions in high-income countries
would thus be partly offset by increased emissions in
developing countries, a variant of “carbon leakage”.
This occurs when one country increases its carbon
dioxide emissions because a second country with a
strict climate policy has reduced its emissions, though
the literature shows little evidence of the size of the
long-term leakage effects.
The prospect of carbon leakage gave rise to proposals for border taxes based on the embodied
carbon content of goods imported from developing countries. But such schemes are rarely effective
and are hard to set up. Some scholars find that the
border tax adjustments have little impact on reducing carbon leakage and protecting economic competitiveness (Antimiani et al. 2011; McKibbin and
Wilcoxen 2009). Cosbey (2008) further raises issues
of compliance with international trade agreements,
as well as other legal and institutional issues. Also,
border tax does not hold the comparison with consumption taxation, which, besides being simpler to
implement, implies a more efficient allocation of
resources across the life cycle and thus an arguably
more equitable proposition from the perspective of
developing countries.
Structural change towards a service-focused
society, as in industrialized countries, does not necessarily imply a global reduction of resource use,
because resource- and pollution-intensive industries
in developing countries are producing goods for
wealthier countries (Stamm et al. 2009). For this
reason data based on domestic production provide
a highly skewed picture as they disregard embodied resources and emissions in imported goods and
services, especially in a world where manufacturing
production is shifting to industrializing and developing countries.
Consumption-based accounting helps reorient the
picture: covering international trade and transport, it
encapsulates all emissions related to global consumption (Peters 2008). Consumption-based inventories draw on total global emissions for the economic
consumption of a country, rather than the economic

128

and agreements and a growing focus on resource efficiency, productivity and competitiveness – so too does
demand for cleaner technologies, less risk to the environment and better resource management (including
recycling and resource recovery; UNIDO 2011b).
But pinning down job numbers is a challenge,
not least for the methodological and definitional
reasons suggested above (see, for example, Bowen
2012). Statistics rarely capture self-employment
or the informal economy, especially in developing
countries where reliable and comprehensive data are
scarce.
Still, the literature abounds with estimates for
green jobs, and usually suggests that numbers are
increasing steadily (for example, Renner, Sweeney and
Kubit 2008). It may also claim that tens of millions of
green jobs have been created worldwide, with a growth
surge over the past few years, notably in renewable
energy and ecosystem services, such as forestry (ILO
2012).
Many sector-specific studies estimate numbers.
Rutovitz and Atherton (2009) estimate 9  million
jobs were created in energy globally in 2010, with
about 20 percent of jobs created by renewable energy
and energy-efficient generation. Renner, Sweeney and
Kubit (2008) “conservatively” put jobs in renewable
and supplier industries at 2.3 million worldwide.
India alone may be able to create some 900,000
jobs by 2020 (from 2007) in biomass gasification. Of
these, 300,000 might be among manufacturers of gasifier stoves (including masons and metal fabricators)
and 600,000 in biomass production, supply chain
operations and after-sales services. Another 10,000
people might find employment in advanced biomass
cooking technologies (Holdren 2007).
UNEP (2011b) estimates that waste recycling
employs 12  million people in just three countries
– Brazil, China and the United States. Sorting and
processing recyclables alone sustain 10 times more
jobs than land filling or incineration based on weight.
Basic manufacturing industries such as steel, aluminium, cement and paper are starting to stimulate
green jobs through scrap use, greater energy efficiency

and reliance on alternative energy sources (Renner,
Sweeney and Kubit 2008).
Potential for green jobs
Energy is the emblematic example of sectoral “greening”. Renewable energy (excluding large hydropower)
represented almost half the new generation capacity
added globally in 2011, up from a minuscule share just
a few years earlier. Global investments in renewable
power and fuels rose by 17 percent to $257 billion in
2011 – for comparison, investment in fossil-fuel generating capacity was $302 billion – with about a third
of that in developing countries (REN21 2012; UNEP
and BNEF 2012).
Evaluations of the impact of green technology on employment are rare. One that used model
simulation and scenario analysis estimated the
impact of a “green investment” scenario on industry. Assuming that 3  percent of total additional
green investment was allocated to improving the
efficiency of industrial energy, it estimated that
109  million jobs would be created by 2050, or
15 percent more than in the business-as-usual baseline scenario (UNEP 2011b).
Waste collection seems to offer promising returns
on investment. In the same simulation the green
investment scenario then allocated 0.16  percent of
global GDP to three areas of waste management, prioritizing investment in the first two, waste recycling
and composting of agricultural and forestry organic
waste (including energy recovery), to support material recovery and agricultural activities; the remaining
investment was in waste collection.
About $33  billion a year was allocated to waste
recycling and composting over the period, based on
a global average estimated cost of recycling of $100
per tonne of waste. Waste collection alone generated
almost 10  percent of the additional jobs worldwide
expected by 2050 in this scenario over the baseline,
reflecting current low rates of collection and recycling
in low-income countries.

communications technologies, repair and maintenance, and substitute and recycled materials will be in
greater demand (ILO 2012).
Evidence is mixed on the employment effects
across economies as a whole, with most research suggesting that the impact of green structural changes
on total employment is probably quite small (OECD
2011). Moreover, an increase in renewable energy
prices may raise overall energy prices throughout the
economy, offsetting some of the gains. Production
and employment in other sectors of the economy can
also be held down when the energy sector absorbs
more workers and greater investment in physical
capacity.
How much policy support to give?
From a policy perspective, the prospects for green
jobs are far more interesting than current headcount
figures. The literature on the outlook and on the level
of state support that associated policies should receive
reflects the debate on this topic, which is closely linked
to questions on the degree of state intervention in a
market economy (Table 6.1).
Studies relying on general equilibrium models tend
to be less optimistic about the overall impact of renewable energy expansion on employment. Concretely,
some studies disregard the potential effects of the
investments elsewhere in the economy, possibly in
another sector.

Resolving these issues is not merely academic,
but key for policy in that they form the foundation (sometimes motivation) for interventions: the
debate is almost reduced to the trade-offs between
policy objectives in environmental protection, job
creation and economic growth. These goals converge in some cases, but not always. But the aspirations for further socioeconomic development and
environmental concerns can be reconciled through
adjustments that help in decoupling – put simply,
dissociating the “environmental bads” from the
“economic goods” (OECD 2002). Globally, the
political will to support greener industries and
associated employment stems from rising concerns
over resource dependency and security (Dittrich et
al. 2012).

1.	 As an example, secondary scrap-based steel production requires up to 7  percent less energy
than primary production, and employs around
200,000 people worldwide (Renner, Sweeney

have high yield potential (UNIDO 2011b). Other
related measures, such as resource substitution,
eco-innovation and industrial symbiosis, all offer
prospects for improving resource productivity
cost-effectively, primarily in developing countries
(Dobbs et al. 2011).

2.	 The term makes an analogy to the work by Simon
Kuznets who postulated that income inequality first rises as economic activity increases, then
plateaus and finally decreases. This relationship
would thus form an inverted U shape, implying
that a certain level of economic activity needs

to be reached before income inequality can
decouple.
3.	 This is because green jobs relate to occupations
and skills with an identifiable environmental focus, but environment-related jobs include
employment in industries (or projects) whose
products are deemed of environmental benefit.

Section 3  Policy imperatives

One important message from the previous section was that the effect of drivers on employment is
not straightforward and not always unambiguous.
Ensuring that it is beneficial often depends on having
the right combination of government policies in place.
The third section of the report thus turns to examine the role of industrial policy in promoting structural
change and employment generation. In its first chapter
it begins by looking at the policy efforts needed at the
national level to achieve this change. After discussing
the different roles and instruments governments have
in targeting drivers of structural change, it underlines
the importance of understanding the specific conditions of countries attempting to transform themselves
and of using tailor-made policies. While policy content attuned to concrete realities is a necessity, another
strong message is that getting the policy-­making process right is crucial, as is consensual implementation:
proper coordination among stakeholders; engaged
political leadership; public–­private dialogue; management capability; and flexibility in execution are just a

few of the key dimensions that make industrial policies work.
The second chapter then highlights human capital
for manufacturing structural change. It is one of the
policy areas where, arguably, more consensus could
be achieved among views of what a government’s
role should be in promoting industrialization, and so
deserves special attention in this report.
The final chapter of the section addresses whether
current international arrangements provide the necessary policy space for countries to be able to engage in
structural change and, through it, generate employment. It analyses international collaboration as
expressed in bilateral investment treaties in attracting
foreign direct investment, the role of private sustainability standards in avoiding the “race to the bottom”,
and the role of international knowledge exchange for
best practices in learning. It ends with a glance at what
the post-2015 development agenda might entail for
manufacturing structural change and employment
generation.

131

Chapter 7

Industrial policy

Industrial policy should seek to promote structural change: from agriculture to labour-intensive
or resource-based manufacturing at an early stage of
industrialization; through upgrading and diversification in manufacturing at a later stage; and through
technological innovation at an advanced stage.
The state can promote policy either as a regulator,
financier, producer or consumer, using policy instruments that target key drivers of structural change: education and skills, capital and technology, and material
inputs. In this targeting the state should oversee close
coordination with other policies such as those on competition, trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), as
well as the exchange rate, as they can undermine the
objectives of industrial policy if they are misaligned.
Carefully chosen and implemented interventions
can promote industrial growth and employment, as
confirmed by solid evidence from the results of impact
evaluations for high-income countries published in
2010 and 2012. (Subsidies for competitive sectors
may be one promising approach.) But while international experience with policy instruments can provide
interesting lessons, developing countries are unlikely
to succeed with simple emulation, because a strategic
approach to industrial policy-making has to be tailored to their own circumstances.
Evidence-based and realistic industrial policy
implemented in a consensual way is key for policy
effectiveness, irrespective of the concrete instruments
used. This would require measures to:
•	 Use – do not fight – the political system. A fact of
political life is that no policy will be underwritten
unless those in power agree to it.
•	 Strengthen political leadership. This will set a
national transformation agenda that aims, in lowincome countries, to create and nurture productive activities or, in middle-income countries, to
advance technologically.
•	 Encourage public–private dialogue. This will help
to both design interventions that draw on expert
132

knowledge in the private sector and ensure that all
key stakeholders support decisions.
•	 Boost industrial policy management capabilities.
These capabilities have to be strengthened considerably among key actors in developing countries in
a pragmatic and concentrated way, ideally through
learning by doing.
Finally, developing countries should initiate their
own national industrial policy experimentation and
learning processes, including monitoring and evaluation, to identify high-impact solutions.
Promoting structural change through
industrial policy
Industrial policy is a widely used term but difficult
to define. Warwick (2013, p. 15) suggests “any type
of intervention or government policy that attempts
to improve the business environment or to alter the
structure of economic activity towards sectors, technologies or tasks that are expected to offer better prospects for economic growth or societal welfare than
would occur in the absence of such intervention, i.e. in
the market equilibrium”.1
The main objective of industrial policy is to “anticipate structural change, facilitating it by removing
obstacles and correcting for market failures” (Syrquin
2007). Hausmann and Rodrik (2003, 2006) identify
three main types of market failure that are particularly relevant for new activities to emerge (thus changing the industrial structure), where identification and
correction provide a rationale for industrial policy:
coordination externalities, as specific new industries
or activities require simultaneous, large investments
to become profitable; information externalities, as
discovery of new activities requires an investment
whose returns cannot be fully appropriated by the
investor; and labour training externalities, as firms
regard labour mobility as a disincentive to invest in
on-the-job training, thus reducing technological
spillovers.

“

Influencing and planning strategically a

country’s position in an international setting has
gained importance as an industrial policy objective

Early stage: from agriculture to
low‑technology manufacturing
At the initial stage of industrialization agriculture is
still the largest sector for employment, though it tends
to be the least productive (Herrendorf, Rogerson
and Valentinyi 2013). This lower productivity than
in the more advanced sectors leaves a great potential
untapped, suggesting that manufacturing can still
play a major role as an engine of growth through the
reallocation of resources (see Chapter 1).
To promote structural change by moving from
agriculture to manufacturing, low-income countries
need to align agricultural and industrial policies. They

need agricultural development strategies with a strong
emphasis on increasing agricultural productivity,
which will translate into cheaper agricultural products and release a typically unskilled and cheap labour
force. And to absorb the released labour and to benefit from cheaper agricultural inputs, industrial policy
should seek to create or support labour-intensive and
resource-based manufacturing with low entry barriers,
which are likely to favour industrial SMEs important
for broadening the industrial base. Support for SME
development should thus be an integral part of industrial policy at this early stage.

7
Industrial policy

Financial market failures sometimes provide a
major justification for industrial policy through the
creation of special financial instruments for small and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs), or special financing institutions like development banks to finance,
say, new products, firms entering new markets or new
technologies.
Finally, the role of influencing and planning strategically a country’s position in an international setting has gained importance as an industrial policy
objective during an age when value chains get more
fragmented and there are more options for countries
and regions to plug themselves into international and
regional production networks.
But industrial policies have not been free of controversy, even though they have been extensively used
in the developed and developing worlds. In the decades after World War II advanced countries successfully implemented industrial policies – usually the
tricky part – as, for example, France through indicative planning, Finland through technology policy and
Ireland through the targeting of high-tech foreign
investment (Weiss 2011). In the developing world
East Asia from the 1960s provides good examples of
success: starting with Japan and continuing with the
Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province of
China, governments took extensive measures to promote industry, depending on the country’s development stage. These different stages are reviewed below.

Climbing the ladder: towards more
technologically advanced industries
In countries that have reached the middle-income range
or are on track to do so, such as Brazil, China, Malaysia
and Thailand, the contribution of agriculture to GDP
and employment has declined, due to a greater share of
industry, particularly manufacturing. Although lowtech manufacturing subsectors still play an important
but decreasing role, some medium- and high-tech industries increase their employment (see Chapter 3). While
the latter sectors tend to create fewer jobs than low-tech
manufacturing, they provide more high-skilled jobs
with positive spillover effects on the economy.
The above observations suggest that industrial
policy should focus on two issues. First, because
unemployment is likely to remain a critical issue in
most middle-income countries, industrial policy
should aim to improve efficiency and productivity in
labour-intensive and low-tech sectors to increase competitiveness. Yet as per capita income grows, competing on cost with low-income countries will become
increasingly difficult, bringing forth a second issue:
middle-income countries will need to diversify and
upgrade their economic structure towards more technologically advanced sectors.
Government intervention is needed to favour a
shift towards higher value, higher tech or skill-intensive industries and to build the required productive
and technological capabilities, with a sharper focus on
the quality rather than quantity of jobs.2

Keeping technological leadership: innovation
Although reindustrialization is now on the agenda
of many high-income countries, they cannot compete in low-cost, mature segments of industry. So
they should pursue differentiation (by raising quality) and innovation (by launching new products and
services) – a strategy that may be prescient given their
relative abundance of highly educated labour. In particular, although global manufacturing production is
shifting gradually from high-income to lower income
countries, innovation remains dominated by countries
in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD; Pilat et al. 2006).
The differentiation and innovation strategy
requires countries to shift resources into promising
new areas so as to expand the global technological
frontier. The shift towards new technological trajectories, which are desirable from an industrial–dynamic
or social (“green technology”) perspective, will require
an industrial policy that removes obstacles. It has
therefore to be aligned with competition and innovation policies to reduce entry barriers, and instruments
have to be designed to favour innovative new entrants
and counter incumbents’ industrial advantages, as
well as their lobbying power.
Manufacturing-related services, too, should be a
key element in high-income countries. Although these
countries typically show waning reliance on manufacturing as a source of growth and increasing dependence on services, links between industrial and service
activities have become important because of the greater
share of service activities necessary for or complementary to manufacturing production (see Chapter 3).
Industrial policy instruments – four
main categories
According to Peres and Primi (2009), the state can
promote industrial development in four main ways:
as a regulator establishing tariffs, fiscal incentives or
subsidies; as a financier influencing the credit market
and allocating public and private financial resources
to industrial projects; as a producer participating
directly in economic activity through, for example,

134

state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and as a consumer
guaranteeing a market for strategic industries through
public procurement programmes.
This subsection discusses the main policy instruments for these roles, and notes that successful industrial policy is not only about picking winners but also
about letting losers go (Günther and Alcorta 2011).
Beneficiaries should be aware that government support is time limited (through “sunset clauses”) and
based on performance incentives.
The state as regulator
Fiscal incentives are government transfers of public resources to firms, activities, whole industries or
regions, free or at below-market rates, made through
direct subsidies (cash or in kind) or indirect subsidies
(tax incentives).
Direct subsidies are important for national governments to promote industry in areas such as production,
investment, research and development (R&D), exports
and training. It is important to distinguish between
generic subsidies from sectorial ones. The former may
encourage investment but not structural change. The
areas requiring support depend on a country’s characteristics. Advanced countries consider R&D subsidies to be legitimate industrial policy for promoting high-tech industries, but they generally oppose
export subsidies – also prohibited by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) – which target a particular
activity in which emerging market countries are typically strong (Naudé 2010). But during the 2008 global
financial crisis France, Germany and the United States
resorted to direct subsidies to bail out manufacturing
firms, particularly in the automotive industry.
Indirect subsidies (tax incentives) present no general
model for promoting manufacturing. While many commentators attribute part of the Asian growth story to tax
incentives, some recommend governments to limit their
use (James 2009). In fact, tax systems in many countries
have been subject to comprehensive reforms, curtailing
the use of incentives for investment. The United Nations,
World Bank, OECD and International Monetary Fund
all recognize the importance for developing countries to

Recognizing the importance of

manufacturing SMEs in the economy, many
countries have developed subsidized loan
schemes to support their development

The state as financier
A well-functioning financial market is crucial to boost
industrial development through the provision of competitive lending for working capital, leasing of capital
goods, consultancy services, and loans for fixed assets
including investment projects and real-estate development. Access to reasonably priced credit is a key constraint for SMEs particularly, even for those with projects having positive private and social returns, as they
usually lack collateral or credit history.
Recognizing the importance of manufacturing
SMEs in the economy, many countries have developed

subsidized loan schemes to support their development. Under the execution of the Small and Medium
Industry Development Organization, the Turkish
government has targeted manufacturing enterprises
through the SME Credit Support Mechanism, which
offers interest rate support for bank loans.
Governments can also offer guarantee schemes to
increase lender confidence in making investments in
SMEs, by supporting either debt or equity finance, to
ensure more credit or better credit terms for targeted
sectors or groups. The Egyptian Credit Guarantee
Company, established by the government as a jointstock company, had a guarantee coverage of only
50 percent with a low risk-sharing rate, but the guarantee has nevertheless proved “attractive to banks in
Egypt because the guarantee fund is actually deposited in participating banks” (Levitsky 1997, p. 7).
Launched in 2000, the Small Business Guarantee
Fund (FOGAPE) in Chile guarantees a share of loans
made by banks to SMEs, small exporters and small
business associations, with a maximum of 50–80 percent according to credit type. No doubt partly due to
FOGAPE, the share of SMEs with access to credit is
far higher (estimated in 2007 at 93 percent at least)
than in many other countries (Agosin, Larraín and
Grau 2010).
National development banks hold a special place
as industrial policy tools (Box 7.1). They are typically

Industrial policy

find “the right balance between an attractive tax regime
for domestic and foreign investment, by using tax incentives, for example, and securing the necessary revenues
for public spending” (IMF et al. 2011, p. 10).
The fact is that the tax incentives offered by individual countries now more than ever affect the choice
of enterprises with regard to where to set up a business
(James 2009). Countries can no longer design their
tax systems in isolation but have to consider those of
other countries thanks to the global mobility of capital and labour, but they risk engaging in harmful tax
competition. Such countries are also concerned that
once the tax holiday expires, manufacturing enterprises, often very mobile, will move their operations to
another country that lures them with incentives.

Box 7.1	
The Brazilian Development Bank
Founded in 1952, the Brazilian Development Bank
(BNDES) is wholly owned by the federal government. Its
mission is “to foster sustainable and competitive development in the Brazilian economy, generating employment
while reducing social and regional inequalities” (BNDES
n.d.). BNDES, the largest creditor in South America, is
a main source of long-term financing to Brazilian enterprises, with annual disbursements climbing sharply from
$11.7 billion in 2003 to $82.3 billion in 2011 (Colby 2012).
The government uses BNDES as a key instrument in
implementing industrial, infrastructure and foreign trade
policies. Manufacturing industry is central to the agenda
of BNDES and received around 40 percent of the Bank’s

total disbursements in 1995–2012 (Banco Central do Brasil n.d.).
BNDES supports manufacturing firms through the
following measures: finance for investment projects to
establish and upgrade plants, modernize processes and
spur technological upgrading and innovation; funding for
production, sales, acquisition or leasing of new machinery and equipment; support for production and export of
goods and services marketed abroad; and facilitation of
changes in firm ownership and project risk sharing (Ottaviano and de Sousa 2007).

“set up to foster economic development, often taking into account objectives of social development and
regional integration, mainly by providing long-term
financing to, or facilitating the financing of, projects
generating positive externalities” (UNDESA 2006b,
pp. 10–11). Most of these banks focus on sectors that
governments consider strategically important for the
long-term development of the domestic economy, and
act as catalysts for expanding targeted sectors and as
facilitators of structural change.
In the longer run countries could aim at correcting credit market failures by strengthening institutions to reduce asymmetric information costs through
credit bureaus, improve legal and judicial enforcement institutions and influence informal institutions
by promoting a “repayment culture” (Meléndez and
Perry 2010). The provision of credit rating systems is
particularly important, and this type of information
service should be introduced by governments if not
developed by the private sector.
The state as producer
In pursuing development objectives the state has
historically played a key role in industrial development through SOEs. State ownership can be justified when there are natural monopolies unsuitable for
private enterprises, for social or developmental goals,
to achieve investment returns for supporting budgetary objectives, and for national economic security
(Mattlin 2009). They can also act as incubators for
technical skills and managerial talent, as in China
(Rodrik 2010).
Although there are good arguments to privatize
enterprises, the state can succeed as an entrepreneur.
A well-known example is the Republic of Korea’s steel
firm, POSCO, which began production in 1973, at
a time where the country’s biggest export items were
fish, cheap apparel, wigs and plywood. It became the
most efficient producer in the global steel industry
in 10 years (Chang 2006). Likewise, Embraer, the
state-owned Brazilian aircraft company, has established itself as a key player in the aerospace industry.
European countries had used state subsidies and SOEs

136

to expand at an unprecedented rate for more than
three decades after World War II, but shifted towards
privatization, deregulation and competition at the end
of the 1970s (Ulltveit-Moe 2008).
The state as consumer
As a consumer, a national government can be the
single largest buyer in several markets for goods and
services in a country. It can use this purchasing power
to stimulate economic activity and innovation, protect national industry against foreign competition,
improve competitiveness of some industrial sectors or
remedy regional disparities (Watermeyer 2000). For
example, to develop or improve the competitiveness
of selected sectors, public procurement was used after
World War II in East Asia (Kattel and Lember 2010).
Countries there started by identifying the products as
well as the technological capabilities and know-how
needed to produce them. Procurement contracts were
then awarded to domestic firms with the government
setting deadlines and quality standards to ensure continuing improvement and productivity in these targeted products.
States use several approaches (Yülek and Taylor
2012). A government can “buy domestic” to support
selected industrial sectors, as illustrated by the Buy
America Act in the United States, which gives preference to domestic products in federal government
procurements. Similarly, local content rules – requiring a share of the procured product to be produced
by domestic firms – can support domestic industry
in two ways: first, by providing a market to domestic business (even when the procurement contract is
awarded to a foreign firm) as well as employment and
income to the country; second, by helping domestic
businesses acquire know-how, transfer technology and
lower unit costs through learning-curve effects.
Countertrade agreements are another approach,
and build reciprocity into a transaction by requiring
a foreign seller to purchase specified products from
domestic firms. One example is an offset arrangement
where a government requires a foreign firm to transfer economic benefits (beyond cash) to the domestic

Training and education call for industrial

policy instruments that provide explicit
incentives for human capital investments by
firms and households, beyond the government’s
required investments in education

Targeting key drivers of structural
change
Industrial policy instruments can be used to target key
drivers of structural change (see Chapter 4): education
and skills, technology and innovation, and material
inputs.
Education and skills
Education and skills3 are essential to build productive capacities for national industrial development,
yet would be underprovided in a pure market-driven
environment as employers have too few incentives to
provide funds for training and education because of
labour mobility (the employee may move to another
firm). Likewise, there is typically insufficient private
spending on education as individuals base their investment decisions on private returns, not social returns.
Further, employees would have few chances to selffinance the acquisition of human capital because it is
extremely hard to “mortgage” future expected returns
(a financial market failure).
So, training and education call for industrial policy instruments that provide explicit incentives for
human capital investments by firms and households,
beyond the government’s required investments in
education. These instruments include scholarships or
long-term loans for undergraduate and graduate university studies (at home and abroad); vocational or
engineering scholarships to carry out in-house training of prospective workers by firms; wage subsidies as
an incentive for firms to hire and train more employees; demand-driven courses to train workers in the

technical standards in certain industries; and business
training for owners and managers of SMEs in issues
like management, finance, accounting and investment analysis. Although countries have introduced
policy measures to support such skills, the national
training fund is increasingly popular (see Box 8.3 in
Chapter 8).

economy as a condition for awarding a procurement
contract. These benefits may include technology transfer, managerial services, investment, credit transfer,
licensed production or co-production, with a view to
improving domestic productive capabilities.
Public procurement usually needs strong government capabilities, and often generates controversy
among foreign companies, which may request application of the WTO principle of equal treatment (Yülek
and Taylor 2012).

Technology and innovation
Technology and innovation are crucial for strengthening industrial competitiveness. Yet limited appropriability, lack of competitive finance, and coordination
failures, among other factors, make them prone to
market failures and induce underinvestment relative
to the socially optimal level (Martin and Scott 2000).
Government intervention to promote adopting technology and innovation to upgrade domestic private
sector capabilities is required. Countries have very
different capabilities in this area, often dictating different policies, but most policy instruments finance
and provide public inputs or information (Melo 2001)
and include grants (typically non-reimbursable), subsidized loans and fiscal incentives (see above).
Innovation requires strong links between universities and research institutions and enterprises. To create those links, technological platforms can be established to provide forums where firms in a particular
sector (or region) can identify technological obstacles
and define the actions to remove them, partnering
with research institutions. Similarly, technological
centres or institutions can be set up to offer consulting to firms in various areas, such as product or process
R&D; metrology, normalization, and certification services; and technology choice and adaptation (Box 7.2).
In public procurement schemes for innovation, a
government agency places orders to purchase a product that does not yet exist or needs to be customized
but that could probably be developed within a reasonable time through additional R&D, in this way lifting the producers’ innovative capacity. The Internet
and global positioning technology are two examples
of government innovation-oriented procurement
from the United States (Kattel and Lember 2010),

Fundación Chile

Industrial policy

A private, non-profit organization created in 1976 by the
government of Chile and ITT Corporation, Fundación Chile
focuses its main research on adapting and applying technologies in commercial operation elsewhere to the Chilean environment, though it sometimes conducts original
research. Its best-known success is salmon cultivation,
developed in Norway and Scotland.
Fundación Chile turns an idea abroad into a domestic business opportunity by first identifying a profitable
product, technology or service that has still to enter the

and the X2000 high-speed train, the AXE telephone
switch and energy-efficient lighting and refrigerators are examples from Sweden (Edquist and ZabalaIturriagagoitia 2012).
Material inputs
As a reliable supply system of low-cost and highquality material inputs is crucial for local industrial
production, countries lacking it sometimes use policy
instruments to reduce the costs of inputs. A “linkage
creation” policy seeks to identify the main requirements for inputs and raw materials from large firms,
and match this demand with local suppliers, often
SMEs. More important, the policy should promote
the development of local suppliers through technical
assistance. Likewise, trade liberalization can reduce
costs of imported inputs, benefiting local manufacturers, particularly those targeting export markets,
through productivity and competitiveness gains
(Amiti and Konings 2007; Topalova and Khandelwal
2011). For their part, tariff incentives allow firms to
partially or totally recover some taxes or duties on
imported inputs, while temporary admission schemes
give to importing firms partial or total exemption
from duties on input materials used in production.

Finally it commercializes it.
Other successes include berry cultivation, and exports
of vacuum-packed and boxed frozen pork and beef, now

few projects that did not meet expectations, such as the
cultivation of southern hake, farmed turbot and abalone.

Market-based instruments. Instruments such as taxes,
subsidies and tradable permits consider the costs
of pollution and environmental degradation in the
pricing of goods and services. For example, material
input taxes seek to encourage a more efficient use of
resources and to promote more material-efficient
production technologies; they are applied to each
(physical) unit of virgin extraction. They are already
levied on a few resources (usually minerals) in some
countries, including Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark and
France. Tradable resource-use permits can be rights to
emit pollutants (including greenhouse gas emissions)
or rights to access natural resources (such as water)
that are allocated to firms, which may trade them. The
aim is to encourage firms to use existing opportunities
to reduce resource use and particularly to develop
innovative resource-saving technologies, to profit from
unused permits.
Financial incentives or subsidies can also be
used for resource-saving research and technological
innovation, but subsidies that encourage overuse of
natural resources should be removed. All subsidies
should be time bound, well targeted and performance
monitored.
Regulatory and voluntary instruments. Norms and
standards that set binding limits can be defined
by public authorities to achieve goals like reducing
emissions and waste or increasing resource or
energy efficiency. Bans are more stringent, and

If industrial policy targets sectors rather

than particular firms, it can be quite compatible
– in fact complementary – to competition policy

Information-based instruments. Governments can use
various measures to increase awareness by providing
information on resource efficiencies and sustainable
industrial production. Information-based approaches
include using environmental data, indicators and ecolabelling or certification. Designed and implemented
well, they can strengthen the effectiveness of
other policy instruments such as environmental
taxes. Finally, data and indicators should facilitate
benchmarking as a way to determine the resource or
energy efficiency of a system.
Aligning industrial and other policies
The targeting of key drivers requires close coordination with other policies – notably on competition,
trade and FDI, and exchange rates – that play an
important complementary role to industrial policy.5
Failure to exploit these synergies may counteract policy objectives.
Competition policy
Competition policy includes competition legislation,
which aims to prevent agreements between firms
restricting competition (cartels), abuse of market
power by dominant firms, and mergers or acquisitions
that may create a dominant player and weaken competition. It may also include competition advocacy,
which aims to promote (if needed, set up) a culture of
competition.
Competition and industrial policies are often
viewed as mutually conflicting. This is because competition policy typically aims to foster rivalry between
firms in an industry for greater efficiency and economic welfare, while industrial policy frequently
gives a market advantage over competitors (including

producers of substitute products) to favoured domestic
sectors or industries.
Two areas of possible conflict stand out (Brooks
2007). The first relates to new entry. There is a conflict
zone between a high degree of competition (“contestability”) in markets and the willingness of firms to
commit large investments into developing new products and new types of technologies or branching out
into new areas of international specialization. Thus
where innovation is crucial, protection of intellectual
property rights is needed through patents, copyrights
and trademarks, as temporary monopoly rents provide
incentives to invest in creating or improving products,
services or processes.
The second area concerns competition between
domestic and foreign firms, as entry of the foreign
firms usually increases competition in the short term
and may threaten domestic ones. Governments may
be tempted to use industrial policy to impede foreign
entry, but they should also consider the possible positive effects of FDI on the endowments and productivity of factors of production, as well as spillover effects.
The mode of foreign entry also matters, as mergers and
acquisitions may result in abuse of market power by a
dominant player, violating competition policy.
Aghion et al. (2012) argue that if industrial policy
targets sectors rather than particular firms, it can be
quite compatible – in fact complementary – to competition policy (see also Possas and Borges 2009).
In order words, competition policy can be used to
foster competition within sectors or industries that
were picked by industrial policy, as in the Republic
of Korea where intense competition between chaebol
was ensured in the domestic market, or in Japan where
oligopolistic rivalry rather than single national champions was promoted (Brooks 2007). Competitive
pressures within an industry can also be maintained if
instruments use sunset clauses (Rodrik 2004).
Finally, industrial policy seeks to favour technologies or tasks expected to offer better prospects
for economic growth or societal welfare. Given its
greater emphasis on the long-term development
path, industrial policy can be given precedence over

7
Industrial policy

typically imposed on toxic materials. The Stockholm
Convention focuses, for instance, on eliminating or
reducing the release of 12 persistent organic pollutants.
Beyond regulatory measures, voluntary agreements or
negotiated environmental agreements can also be used
to address, say, pollution and energy efficiency targets
as well as reporting requirements.

hierarchical structure of international production
and trade relationships has become a prime
target of trade and industrial policies

Industrial policy

competition policy. But competition policy provides
a framework or contributes to “proper governance” of
industrial policies. A strong and independent competition authority with clear and transparent rules for
decision-making can be an important complementary
agency for forward-looking industrial policy measures, as in the European Union (EU), where competition policy is at the EU level and so somewhat
removed from capture by national lobbying efforts of
incumbent firms.
Trade and foreign direct investment policy
Trade policy no doubt played an important role in
countries’ catch up by imposing direct import restrictions (tariffs, quotas and non-tariff barriers), offering
preferable treatment to domestic producers on the
domestic market (public procurement policies) and
providing export support (export credits, and support to access foreign markets and export-processing
zones; Chang 2003). Today, although some trade and
FDI policies have been restricted through bilateral or
multilateral trade policy agreements, governments still
have some space to use trade-related instruments for
industrial policy.
Developments over recent decades have been
two-sided. There has been a strong increase in international integration, with a rising number of countries with liberalized trade regimes, leading to greater
openness of their economies. But there has also been
greater pressure on countries to move towards a more
liberalized trade policy regime, but this can lead to
specialization in products in which a country has a
comparative advantage at the moment of liberalization. For many developing countries this may translate
into producing and exporting only low value-added
products, such as agricultural commodities, or only
low value-added manufactures, such as textiles and
electronic components, characterized by low wages.
So analysis and policy concerns have shifted toward a
dynamic perception of the place that a country’s producers occupy in international production structures
(at the industry level) or international value chains (at
the task or fragment level within industries).

140

Climbing up the ladder in this seemingly hierarchical structure of international production and trade
relationships has become a prime target of trade and
industrial policies. Such hierarchies have been operationalized in empirical research through rankings by
capital-, skill-, technology- or R&D-intensities, leading to a focus on supporting a country’s move across
ladders of such hierarchies. The role of foreign producers as sources of technology spillovers and as support
for access to foreign markets has been recognized. As
a result, great attention has been paid to incentivizing
the channels through which such spillovers to domestic producers would occur, such as through linkage
programmes. Policies that try to encourage more use
of domestic inputs by foreign firms may also play an
important role in upgrading domestic industry and
promoting structural change.
In addition to specialization, trade liberalization
can also lead to deindustrialization, with rapid growth
of manufactured imports, closure of some local industries and stagnation or low growth in industrial jobs
(see, for example, Reinert 2006).
The upshot is that trade policy instruments previously used by successful countries like China and
the Republic of Korea to restrict imports are being
replaced by:
•	 Non-tariff barriers, in a combination of import
licensing, unjustified sanitary and phyto-sanitary
conditions, a complex regulatory environment, red
tape or lengthy customs procedures.
•	 Export-promoting instruments that support exporters in areas such as access to competitive and diversified finance, market access, R&D and training.
As trade policy is a key component of any industrial policy, the current policy space (such as under
WTO rules) may need to be fully assessed and taken
advantage of, or recovered if needed to promote structural change, particularly in developing countries (see
Chapter 9).

Well-designed industrial policies are

a mechanism to promote employment
generation, spur growth and improve welfare
in developing and developed countries alike

Getting industrial policy to work –
more than emulation required
Several recent design-based studies provide compelling empirical evidence that carefully chosen and
implemented industrial policy can promote industrial
growth and employment. For instance, there is now
robust evidence that subsidies to manufacturing firms
can increase employment at comparably very low “cost
per job” (Criscuolo et al. 2012). Well-allocated firmlevel subsidies can also boost total factor productivity
(Aghion et al. 2012), and there is convincing evidence
that tariffs that account for the varying skill levels

among industries can boost economic growth (Nunn
and Trefler 2010). These studies – discussed in more
detail below – emphasize clean-research designs and
use either randomized control trials or natural experiments to identify causal effects, helping make the
industrial policy debate more objective.
Many scholars are now more optimistic that
well-designed industrial policies are a mechanism to
promote employment generation, spur growth and
improve welfare in developing and developed countries alike. Consequently, many of them demand to
move the debate from whether industrial policies
should be considered at all, to how these policies
should be designed and implemented (for instance,
Aghion et al. 2012; Rodrik 2008a).
This subsection summarizes the lessons from
selected impact evaluations of industrial policy interventions. It stresses that reproducing policy instruments in different countries needs to be handled
cautiously, and that evaluations are crucial for experimentation and learning.

Industrial policy

between the domestic economy and its main trading
partners) heavily influences industrial development.
An appreciating real exchange rate makes a country’s
manufactured products less price competitive, which
affects competition on the domestic market relative to
imports and competition of the country’s exports on
foreign markets.6
An argument for policies targeting the tradable
sector (through real exchange rate undervaluation, for
instance) is that tradable activities (particularly manufacturing) are inherently scalable, in that economies
can expand output without running into diminishing returns, unlike non-tradable activities (Rodrik
2008a). Moreover, the scope for productivity growth
and learning is higher in tradable than non-tradable
activities.
In trying to influence real exchange rate movements, authorities have to deal with the difference
between the economy being in a fixed exchange rate
regime (or even a currency union) and in a flexible
exchange rate regime counterpart to its main trading
partners. Closely monitoring the real exchange rate
and keeping it undervalued to support the tradable
sector, primarily manufacturing – including manipulation of the nominal exchange rate – have featured in
almost all successful catch-up countries (Gala 2008;
Rodrik 1986, 2008a). These measures are also crucial
to prevent the current account deficit from becoming unsustainable, which would jeopardize industrial
policy (McCombie and Thirlwall 2004).

Handle with care
The majority of industrial policy instruments in the
past were deliberately designed to achieve a set of
policy objectives. But in most cases prospective justifications were not backed up by retrospective evaluations of the results’ impact on objectives. This paucity
of impact evaluations is a key constraint for a comprehensive and comparative appraisal of their future
potential, their applicability in certain countries or
sectors and their effectiveness for achieving growth
and employment objectives.
In addition, most available analyses must be interpreted with great caution. First, many were not performed thoroughly enough, so an assessment of their
internal validity suggests that causal relationships
between policy instruments and observable impacts
are hard to establish.7 Second, the findings on the
achievements or failures that can be distilled from
international experiences cannot that easily be generalized because of country heterogeneity, so careful
case-by-case assessment is needed.

Governments have many ways to subsidize

firms, activities, whole industries or regions

7
Industrial policy

In a nutshell no comparison of industrial policy
instruments will find a “silver bullet”. Still, it is evident
that the more comparable the two countries under
review are in their stage of development, countryspecific factors, evident challenges and so on, the more
likely it is that comparable results can be achieved.
With these caveats the rest of this subsection presents the most convincing evidence of the potential
success that carefully chosen and well-implemented
instruments can bring about. It looks into the effects
of a number of regularly applied industrial policy
instruments: first, subsidies and subsidized loans and
fiscal incentives, then, trade policy instruments.
Subsidies, subsidized loans and fiscal incentives
Governments have many ways to subsidize firms,
activities, whole industries or regions. Here, we refer
to subsidies as any government action that allocates
public resources – cash, financial assets and tangibles – for free or at below market prices. Many past
cases involved SOEs and provided production inputs
at below market prices, or government owned-banks
that provided credit on preferential terms. Another
way is reduced tax liabilities through tax exemptions,
deductions or credits.
In each case one might assume that the crucial
point is to identify and subsidize those productive
activities where public resources would have the highest impact on employment and growth. But many policy instruments in high-income countries are explicitly based on an equity rationale and do not focus on
efficiency. These include place-based economic development policies that target public resources at disadvantaged geographical areas rather than selected firms
or disadvantaged groups of people. The most credible
impact evaluations are for these place-based policies,
and some design-based studies from high-income
countries provide evidence that such policies have the
potential to promote employment and growth.
For example, Criscuolo et al. (2012) examine the
most important business support scheme in the United
Kingdom: Regional Selective Assistance, which has
provided subsidies to firms (mainly in manufacturing)

142

in deprived areas over the last 40 years. By firm size the
authors find that the subsidy programme had strong,
positive effects for smaller firms, but an essentially
zero impact on larger firms. 8 Spatially, the authors
find that the programme raised employment mainly
by reducing unemployment and did not result in equal
and offsetting falls in employment in non-participating firms. The programme increased employment (and
investment) in deprived areas, where the authors estimate the cost per job at about $6,300. They find no
effects on total factor productivity.
Kline and Moretti (2012) evaluate the long-run
impact of the most ambitious US place-based economic development policy: the Tennessee Valley
Authority programme launched in the 1930s, which
aimed to improve regional economic activity mainly
by investing in large-scale infrastructure programmes.
The authors find that the policy has increased employment in manufacturing, where positive effects are
still present over 70 years after launch. In agriculture
positive employment effects were only temporary, and
starting in the 1960s gains were completely reversed.
As wages in manufacturing were far higher than those
in agriculture, the shift raised aggregate income in the
Tennessee Valley Authority region for an extended
period.
In contrast, Becker, Egger and von Ehrlich (2010),
who evaluated the impact of the Objective 1 scheme
of the EU’s Structural Funds, do not find statistically
significant positive effects on employment rates in eligible areas, but they do report positive GDP per capita
growth effects. In a follow-up study they show that the
impact of the policy varies greatly by a region’s absorptive capacity – that is, the higher a region’s human capital endowment, the more it benefits (Becker, Egger
and von Ehrlich forthcoming).
It remains unclear to what degree these findings
for high-income countries can be generalized to developing countries, especially as policy-makers in developing countries may not target deprived areas but
focus on efficiency. One could seek to identify market
imperfections, which impede manufacturing activities in areas where economic development is already

What can trade policy instruments contribute?
The likely impact of trade policy instruments on
growth and employment is not as clear cut as the proponents of trade liberalization and openness usually
suggest. First, tailored packages of complementary
industrial policy instruments comprising different
areas and accounting for the specific circumstances
of each country seem necessary to benefit from trade
liberalization (see above). Second, trade protection can
be a promising complement for strategically chosen,
relatively skill-intensive sectors.
On the mechanics themselves, trade policies comprise all government actions that favour domestic
(rather than foreign) manufacturing and that promote

exports of the domestic industry. Favouring domestic manufacturing is achieved by trade protection­–
imposing some sort of cost on the import of foreign
goods, typically distinguished between tariffs and
non-tariff barriers to trade (such as import quotas
or import licences). And promoting exports of the
domestic industry can be achieved by any intervention
that subsidizes export activity.
Export subsidies have three theoretical advantages
over trade protection (Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare
2010):
•	 Subsidized exporting firms are subject to the discipline of the international market, which should
force them to become more productive.
•	 Subsidies to exporting firms implicitly help firms
with a certain level of productivity.
•	 The domestic market may be too small to reap the
full benefits of externalities.
It is hard to find rigorous evidence on the impact
of any specific trade policy, and only a single designbased study on the impact of a specific trade policy
could be identified. But a vast empirical literature
exists that tries to answer the underlying question of
how trade protection (in contrast to trade liberalization) affects economic growth and employment. Many
studies show a strong correlation between increasing
trade shares and country performance, while the more
recent literature has started investigating the mechanisms for gains from trade. For at least two reasons,
though, these investigations cannot say much about
the actual impact of trade policies on growth and
employment:
•	 The most commonly used measures of openness
to trade are not measures of policy instruments
themselves, but rather trade volumes (exports
or imports). Given that trade volumes are also
affected by many other factors such as geography
or exchange rate movements, the results could
be misleading (Rodriguez and Rodrik 2001).
Notably, the far fewer studies that use trade policies themselves as an explanatory variable tend to
find insignificant or weak relationships (Harrison
and Rodríguez-Clare 2010).

above the national average that could be overcome
with public resources. Equivalently, the conclusions
of Criscuolo et al. (2012) – to focus on smaller firms
– might not be applicable in low-income countries,
because in such settings only larger firms may have
enough absorptive capacity to benefit from such programmes. In middle-income countries the situation
might again be different.
Design-based studies for low-income countries
are unavailable, but Aghion et al. (2012), looking at
China, provide a convincing argument that firm-level
subsidies targeting production activities to a particular sector have the highest potential to spur growth if
within-sector competition is high, and when the policy preserves this competition.
The crucial role of industrial policy is to induce
companies to stay in high-growth sectors. The notion
that targeting these sectors is more efficient when competition is more intense within a sector and when the
policy manages to preserve competition is supported
by the authors’ empirical analysis (Aghion et al. 2012).
Based on a panel dataset of large Chinese firms for
1998–2007, the authors show that when subsidies are
allocated to competitive sectors (or in such a way as to
preserve competition), the net impact of subsidies on
total factor productivity becomes positive and significant. This suggests that subsidies to competitive sectors may be a promising approach.

Industrial policy

•	 Irrespective of the measure for openness, it is
extremely hard to establish causality. Is it openness to trade that causes economic growth? Or do
growing economies simply become more open?
And if that is not enough, many policies that liberalize trade are introduced as parts of a broader
package of policy changes, making it even harder
to tease out their impacts.
Thus, empirical evidence on trade policy instruments does not allow for a conclusion that policies
promoting openness will spur growth and that trade
protection will hamper growth. And many studies
suggest that openness is not a sufficient condition for
growth, but that gains from trade are contingent on
industrial policies. Accordingly, trade policy instruments should be investigated in a more detailed way in
the future, particularly because effects are very likely
to be heterogeneous across industries.
One design-based study on the impact of tariffs
follows this approach and does at least partially provide support for protectionist trade policy instruments. Nunn and Trefler (2010) point out that the
conflicting results in the previous literature may be
because it is conceptually wrong to look at the impact
of a country’s average tariff. Based on a comprehensive
empirical analysis using cross-country industry-level
panel data, they conclude that tariffs can be effective
in raising growth if the industries chosen for protection are skill intensive. This result is in line with the
infant industry argument that predicts a productivityenhancing effect of tariff protection in the skill-intensive early stages of industrial development.
Making the industrial policy process
more effective
This chapter showed earlier that low- and middleincome developing countries require a strategic
approach to industrial policy-making, tailored to
specific country circumstances. A one-size-fits-all
approach to economic policy has not succeeded in the
last decades and is unlikely to bring about structural
changes in the future. Country heterogeneity demands
a flexible approach to policy design. So the industrial

144

policy process can look very different in one country
than in another, and industrial policy should not follow a universal blueprint approach. Effective industrial policy has to consider country characteristics and
deliberately target the prevalent constraints that are
the key obstacles to a sustained industrial growth path.
Using – not fighting – the political system
An important source of variation in the success and
failure of industrial policy is “political equilibrium”
(Robinson 2009; Evans 1995; Haggard 1990; Wade
1990). This encapsulates the idea that the political system determines the objectives and functioning of the
institutions implementing the industrial policy. This
system, which reflects the preferences of the politically
powerful, determines through its institutions the incentives of the key economic actors, influences the allocation of all public resources and decides on the distribution of income (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson
2005). Given such an institutional setting any industrial
policy will only work if it is in line with, or at least does
not go against, the incentives of the political system.
Whether the politically powerful always benefit
from industrial promotion is not known. But to the
extent that structural change causes a redistribution
of income (or political power), as succinctly put by
Robinson (2009, p. 27): “[I]t is not sufficient to just
propose good economic policies, one must propose
a way in which they will be endogenously chosen by
those with the political power to do so”.
Strengthening political leadership
Despite the increased attention on industrialization
in many developing countries, budgets for industrial
support initiatives, from national treasuries or donors,
are seldom more than negligible, bound up in the fact
that ministries of industry are usually weak players in
cabinet. This was not always the case.
Lall (2004a), arguing persuasively that the priority given to industrial policy in East Asia was
crucial in turning industry into the growth driver,
shows that the importance of industrial policy was
partly reflected in the power vested in the ministries

Governments should join forces with

their industrial private sector to design
interventions based on their combined expert
knowledge and to ensure that decisions
are supported by key stakeholders

Encouraging public–private dialogue
Governments should join forces with their industrial
private sector to design interventions based on their

combined expert knowledge and to ensure that decisions are supported by key stakeholders.
Such dialogue between government and private
sectors – defined as any interaction between the state
and the private sector relating to the design of public
policies – is a key policy process in countries that have
achieved economic growth through structural change
(Altenburg 2010; UNIDO and UNCTAD 2011).
In developing countries with low public sector capacity, private sector input can make a real contribution
to successful policies (Altenburg 2010). Even so, rent
seeking is an inherent risk in public–private dialogue
and governance mechanisms are needed to avoid a
policy outcome narrowly focused on the interests of
certain groups (te Velde and Leftwich 2010).
For that reason a participatory and consensual
decision-making mechanism is one of the key determinants of an effective industrial policy process. It is
easy to agree that a new industrial policy cannot be a
top-down planning process and needs to be based on
such dialogue, but in practical terms at the very least
a clear structure to ensure close private sector involvement is needed.
Easier said than done, however. Fruitful dialogue
requires private sector organizations that allow companies to articulate their needs and give input to the
policy process, yet in low-income countries producers in chambers of commerce and industry may be
overshadowed by trading companies. As retailers and
wholesalers can have fairly different policy concerns
from manufacturers (on tariffs, import quotas and so
forth), governments should consider strengthening
manufacturers’ representation in national chambers.
The unorganized private sector may even need to
strengthen the manufacturers’ (or subsector’s) association, or possibly create it. Most support programmes
for private sector associations focus on increasing
membership or enhancing technical services to constituents, but frequently disregard their capacity to lobby
for member firms’ interests. Thus a more consensual
and effective industrial policy process often requires
targeted institutional-strengthening measures for policy management capabilities of these associations.

responsible for the sector. In Singapore, for instance,
“the management of industrial policy and FDI targeting has been centralized in the powerful Economic
Development Board (EDB).  .  .  . EDB was endowed
with the authority to coordinate all activities relating
to industrial competitiveness and FDI, and given the
resources to hire qualified and well-paid professional
staff, [which is an essential prerequisite] to manage
discretionary policy efficiently and honestly” (Lall
2004a, p. 18). Similarly, the Republic of Korea held
“monthly meetings between top government officials
(chaired by the President himself) and leading exporters” (Lall 2004a, p. 20).
In middle-income countries today, industrial
development rarely receives such backing. Even the
better supported agencies, like the Department of
Trade and Industry in South Africa, are less involved
in structural change than its peers in East Asia were.
In low-income countries some initiatives at the
presidential level are emerging,9 but most plans are
underfunded and donors still largely disregard this
priority, often arguing that industrial development
is for the private sector and that governments should
focus on infrastructure or training programmes.
These views seem misguided. Political leadership
at the top is crucial for raising the profile of industrial policies and for ensuring the required coordination, oversight and monitoring (Rodrik 2004).
Inter-ministerial competition for resources and policy
incoherence can only be prevented by strategic leadership at the highest levels. It is also essential for highranking government officials to be responsible for
industrial policy so they can be held accountable if
these policies fail. In the 1970s the president of the
Republic of Korea himself took the lead role in championing the country’s industrial policies and strategies.
Such ownership is imperative. And beyond that, dialogue with the private sector can create further incentives for the political class to act.

Umbrella organizations can help ensure

broad participation of different private sector
segments without overburdening the dialogue

7
Industrial policy

146

Another point is how to institutionalize mechanisms for public–private dialogue so as to make them
sustainable. They can exist either temporarily, such as
the informal “growth alliances” of public and private
representatives in different industries in Egypt (AbdelLatif and Schmitz 2010), or be sustained over longer
periods, such as the National Economic Development
and Labour Council in South Africa.
Developing country governments may want to
consult a range of successful cases of effective participatory approaches in other countries to decide on the
most appropriate institutional set-up, which could
include a centralized government agency for public–private dialogue, a focal point for private sector
engagement or regular forums.
While the aim of this dialogue is to secure broad
political commitment, success can be held back by a
suboptimal trade-off between the broadest possible
participation and flexible decision-making. Umbrella
organizations can help ensure broad participation of
different private sector segments without overburdening the dialogue, but the internal governance structures must be made representative of industry as a
whole. This point is particularly relevant for SMEs,
which need to join forces to make their voices heard
(Pinaud 2007). Whether and how much trade unions
and civil society bodies should be represented depends
on the scope of deliberations.
A country’s industrial policy is usually formed
at the national level, but dialogue should ideally
take place at various levels of government – from
national through regional to local – to capitalize
on companies’ and entrepreneurs’ local knowledge.
This approach would require private associations
organized at different levels as well as corresponding institutional structures for the dialogue. This
risks overburdening the process, particularly in the
early phase, but some degree of inclusion of local
actors is prerequisite for serious buy-in, and it can
be achieved without far-reaching institutional rearrangements, as with the help of subnational industrial policy forums, which allow firms to air their
concerns.

Boosting industrial policy management
capabilities
Beyond making the above political and other adjustments, countries need to have a certain technocratic
capacity to realize the vision of, say, the president or
prime minister, for industrial policy to succeed. Many
developing countries lack this capacity, which has to
be built pragmatically.
Capacity gaps inhibiting industrial policy
Altenburg (2011, p. 3), who coined the term “industrial policy management capabilities”, highlights that
“the key problem of industrial policy in poor developing countries is that, while the need to correct market
failures is much greater than it is in highly developed
societies, the ability of the public sector to tackle such
failures is also much more limited”.
So the question runs: What are these capacities
and how can they be built? Effective industrial policymaking requires adequate capacities for each step of
the policy cycle (Box 7.3). Strong analytical capacities
are needed to thoroughly diagnose industrial performance, constraints and potential. Decision-making
capacities are needed for the smart design of strategic
directions, and the industrial policy toolbox needs to
be understood to propose adequate policy interventions. Implementation requires strong management
as well as technical and sectoral competencies. And
forward-looking monitoring and evaluation requires
not only adequate financial resources but also technical expertise.
Altenburg (2011) argues that most low- and lower
middle-income countries perform very weakly in
four key dimensions: defining priorities and building
a broad consensus; establishing clear rules for market-based competition transparently and efficiently;
delivering services effectively; and avoiding political
capture.
The causes of the capability challenge are from
home and abroad. Domestically, weak education
and training systems fail to provide enough wellprepared bureaucrats, and neo-patrimonial political
systems go right down most technocratic structures

and sometimes discourage even the most motivated
and well-educated staff involved in industrial policy.
Internationally, some donors have reduced policy
space or even undermined industrial policy measures in the last few decades in various ways, including by facilitating poverty reduction strategy papers
that were biased towards social sectors; imposing
economic policies that do not align with industrial
policy objectives; enforcing deregulation that has
weakened technocratic structures; replacing senior
national decision-makers with international advisors; reducing the competitiveness of productive
sectors through large aid inflows; actively attracting
the most capable and entrepreneurial workforce into
aid institutions; allowing donor fragmentation and
non-alignment with national strategies; and replacing existing institutional structures and mandates
with new implementation units (Altenburg 2011;
Olukoshi 2004).

change. Thus, a longer term component for new productive
capabilities must be the ultimate goal (UNIDO and UNCTAD
2011). The idea of “defying” comparative advantage to create the foundations for future gains is at the core of this leapfrogging approach (Lin and Chang 2009).
Industrial policy interventions for structural change
have to be ambitious by definition, though they can only be
effective if they are realistic not only over time and scope,
but also on the current capabilities of firms and the labour
force and on financial resources for implementation. Governments of low-income countries have to take strategic
bets into consideration, deliberating on the right ambitions.
Once the policy is designed and agreed among stakeholders, policy instruments have to be chosen (see Industrial policy instruments – four main categories, above). The
implementation process of these instruments varies considerably, posing very different challenges among developing countries.
A key feature of the cycle is the feedback loop from
implementation to diagnosis, based on monitoring and
evaluation. This identifies success and failure to be fed
into the next cycle, enabling adaptation and better performance (UNIDO and UNCTAD 2011).

Industrial policy

The phases of the industrial policy process can be characterized as a cycle that starts with the diagnosis and design
of the policy, and then implementation, followed by monitoring and evaluation – which closes one cycle and starts
the next.
The initial phase entails thoroughly evaluating the
country’s industrial capacity, its structure and its competitive performance – an industrial diagnosis. It should also
cover endowment structures, country and population size,
and so on.
The design, building on this diagnosis, prioritizes the
key objectives of the envisaged growth path and proposes
measures to accomplish them. The policy may have different objectives but should identify and acknowledge
trade-offs. Achieving industrial growth the fastest will no
doubt require different choices from securing employment
creation or equitable regional development. In addition,
industrial policies have to identify and prioritize immediate
and future potential and solutions.
A short-term component that aims at easy gains or “lowhanging fruit” – as through upgrading a sector or increasing
value addition to a traditional commodity – is highly important for a realistic process, though any pragmatic short-term
focus must still show the pathway for full-fledged structural

One cannot argue that industrial policy initiatives
would have succeeded in low-income countries without donor involvement, but some egregious examples
of the above issues stand out:
•	 The set-up by an international organization of
a project for competitiveness and private sector
development in Mozambique, which exceeded the
total budget of the national Ministry of Industry
and Trade, was designed with little national
involvement, appropriated senior personnel from
the ministry and essentially operated as a parallel
agency (Krause and Kaufmann 2012).
•	 The simultaneous activities of 10 different donor
agencies on value chain development in Ethiopia
in the 2000s, which all used differing methodologies and cooperated seldom cooperated with each
other (Altenburg 2011).

Sub-Saharan Africa, who largely replaced the
national design of industrial strategies and policies
without much interaction with local actors.
This capability challenge is more severe in the industrial policy arena than others because the more centralized government agencies usually also succeed in securing the best talent. Particularly in many Sub-Saharan
countries, ministries of finance, planning commissions,
development banks and other key players in cabinet are
best placed to secure government resources.
Building management capabilities,
ideally through learning by doing
During the Washington Consensus period, the World
Bank (1997) stated that industrial policy was very
difficult and required particularly high policy skills
compared with other policy areas. Suggesting that the
state’s role should be aligned with its capabilities, it felt
that low-income countries should not engage in this
area but rather build their institutional capabilities
beforehand. Lall (2004b), too, made the point that the
strategic choice for an industrial policy in a country
should ideally be based on an understanding of government capabilities – suggesting that simpler policies
are the preferable option in less sophisticated administrations. But he also highlighted that capabilities can
be built over time.
Criticizing the approach of policy-capability
matching more fundamentally, Ohno (2009) makes
the point that institutions and capabilities of technocrats in low-income countries cannot be enhanced in
a general way, as this is neither politically appealing
nor administratively implementable. Instead, capabilities should be strengthened in a more concentrated
way, through dynamic capacity development. Citing
the East Asian experiences, he suggests that the policy capabilities in developing countries can best be
enhanced through hands-on efforts towards concrete
goals. The pragmatic idea is to concentrate the available resources on executing highest priority tasks, and
to incrementally build additional skills when they are
really needed so as to solve emerging problems when
they arise.

148

This debate cannot easily be settled without
recourse to country cases, but it is clear that, as any economic or social decision with future impact, industrial
policy-making is subject to fundamental uncertainty.
This means that even the most capable administration
will be unable to anticipate either the future development of its country, the dynamics of a certain sector
or the competitive behaviour of competing countries.
Equally, even the most sophistically designed policy
intervention based on thorough analysis and implemented efficiently will not necessarily lead to success.
Industrial policy may certainly be more risky in lowcapability contexts, but may fail anywhere.
Industrial policy should thus be seen as
experimentation­– essentially learning by doing
(see next subsection). Accordingly, the question of
whether industrial policy is possible or not with the
given capabilities should be replaced with: “How can
the experimentation and policy-learning process be
structured to fit the country context?” This process
should not be held back because of concerns about
failure, but interventions should rather be scaled up
slowly from low-risk, low-complexity interventions
to more ambitious initiatives. To quote Altenburg
(2011, p. 36) again: “[T]here is a special need for policies that are cheap [and] simple in their implementation, and cannot easily be captured by influential
interest groups”.
Flexible policy design: experimenting,
learning and evaluating
Gone is the confidence that we have the correct
recipe, or that privatization, stabilization and
liberalization can be implemented in similar
ways in different parts of the world. Reform
discussions focus on the need to get away from
“one-size-fits-all” strategies and on context-specific solutions. The emphasis is on the need for
humility, for policy diversity, for selective and
modest reforms and for experimentation. . . .

especially do not readily lend themselves to comprehensive monitoring and evaluation approaches.
•	 Evaluations can reveal inherent flaws, limitations
and even adverse consequences of industrial policy
interventions. In almost all cases this implies a serious political cost. So full-fledged evaluations are
frequently perceived as a threat, particularly larger
interventions that usually coincide with ambitious
political rhetoric and wide-ranging public interest.
Both these concerns could possibly be resolved
though, at least partially, with a more nuanced and
pragmatic approach to industrial policy experimentation and evaluation. While full-fledged design-based
studies and experimental designs are not always feasible, their distinctive logic should at least be incorporated in the industrial policy decision-making, even if
a final evaluation cannot. The point is that there are
possibilities to design policy instruments as if they
were experiments, without actually executing them as
such. Policy interventions should come with a clearly
formulated and realistic intervention logic or theory of
change. At the very least, this approach would entail:
•	 A clear definition of a target system that makes
concrete the objectives (including trade-offs
among different objectives) that the policy instrument is aiming to have an impact on in the longer
term (increased employment or economic growth,
for example).
•	 Realistic “target corridors” for judging success or
failure with regard to each objective ideally based
on real-world benchmarks (such as minimum
and maximum expected increase in employment,
based on prior achievements in the country or
elsewhere).
•	 An explicit impact model with a comprehensive
depiction of the short- and medium-term changes
in industrial sectors (at the firm and sector levels)
that are needed to reach these long-term targets
(such as required investments of manufacturing
firms and structural changes in the production
activities of firms).
•	 A detailed description of the steps required for
reaching each of these goals (impact paths),

Industrial policy

This chapter has made the point that industrial
policy-makers who need to choose suitable industrial
policy instruments cannot simply follow deterministic
planning. While there is plenty to learn from theory
and practice, and from benchmarking across countries, it is just not possible to generalize findings from
one situation to another. Rather than simply emulating industrial policies that have worked elsewhere,
countries have to go through their own learning process. This process necessarily involves experimentation, and trial and error. Abhijit Banerjee, one of the
leading proponents of this school of thought, emphasizes that “what is probably the best argument for the
experimental approach [is that] it spurs innovation
by making it easy to see what works” (Banerjee 2007,
p. 122).
For this approach to work, however, industrial policy experimentation has to be combined with rigorous
impact evaluation of each implemented instrument
to generate the evidence on which industrial policy
measures work (and which do not) in a given context.
Probably the most important role of industrial policy
monitoring and evaluation in developing countries is
to provide feedback for making the next cycle more
innovative and effective.
Industrial policy-makers in developing countries
would be well advised to gradually shift their attention from investigating and imitating international
best practices to identifying and reproducing national
success stories. In principle this leads us to the recommendation that every industrial policy intervention
should be evaluated retrospectively. Especially in contexts with serious budget limitations and thus prioritization, it is essential to know whether the policy
intervention was effective and whether the resulting
benefits outweighed the associated public costs. But
while this approach is finding more support among
academics and in the donor community, policy practitioners encounter at least two political challenges:
•	 Evaluations, particularly the more sophisticated
ones that include design-based studies, do not
come free, thus reducing the available budgets
for implementing policy. So small interventions

including a critical examination of whether it is
realistic to expect to reach the goal with the time
and resources available.
•	 An account of possible unintended impacts and
side-effects of the policy instrument (risk factors),
based, say, on consultations of experts and affected
stakeholders before the intervention is carried out.
•	 An honest description of the assumed counterfactual, for instance: “What would the employment
rate have been if the government had not subsidized manufacturing wages?”
•	 The selection of concrete impact indicators, which
can be used to measure change both “on the way”
(intermediate indicators) and with regard to the
end objective (final indicators).
This process does not guarantee retrospective
scientific evidence on the causal effect of the policy
instrument, which is unquestionably an evaluation’s
main objective for the academic and donor communities. But it does at least ensure that interventions
are discussed and designed reflexively and that stakeholders are well aware of the actions and achievements
expected of them.
If this process is combined with less sophisticated
and less costly (non-experimental) monitoring and
evaluation designs, such as reflexive comparisons and
qualitative research, industrial policy interventions are
likely to be much more evidence based, consensual and
transparent – and (it is hoped) more effective, without
overburdening the technical and budgetary capacities
of developing countries.

given amount of local currency.
In the ideal case, to obtain an unbiased estimate
of a true causal effect of a policy measure, it is
essential to execute a thorough design-based study
that considers confounding factors, including a
control group, and that avoids selection biases as
well as under- and overestimation of results. A

of this chapter, but Gertler et al. (2011) provide

perspective. Impact evaluations can be costly and
time consuming, and thus hard to combine with
an industrial policy process that often puts more
emphasis on short-term objectives and quick wins
than on systemic transformation.

size is quite intuitive, as larger firms are less likely

Education and training policies for
creating jobs in manufacturing
Employment creation is at the core of industrial strategies geared to sustainable development. There seems to
be consensus that to maximize the benefits of industrialization, labour markets have to generate more and
better jobs, which in turn increase real incomes and
take people out of poverty.
The formation of specialized technical skills plays a
major role in the quantity and quality of employment
generation, and the accelerating pace of technological change is making these skills more important. And
as the skills required for modern manufacturing have
changed, so too have the institutional structures providing them. In the past, employability was correlated with
improvements in basic education. Today’s more competitive world puts greater emphasis on specialized high-level
training, not only through formal training systems but
mainly from the close interaction between the industrial
private sector and the education apparatus.
Technological change and increased pressures to compete have put a premium on top skills in science, engineering, mathematics, computing and information technology. The most advanced countries in Asia, for example,
give incentives to students to enrol in scientific subjects
at university and offer early access to vocational training.

demand, and education and training methods, but
they need to make thorough assessments of skill gaps
to identify industry’s specific needs.

General considerations for skill policies
Most governments agree that human capital is a crucial driver for economic growth. Yet many, particularly in the developing world, have failed to act on this
belief, partly because of their inability to push through
the right policies and partly because of the private sector’s unwillingness to get involved in creating skills.
Some guiding principles based on good practice can
help policy-makers understand the elements that go
into successful skill policies.

Matching short-term needs and long-term
goals
Policy-makers have to create or strengthen skills for
industry today while anticipating demand for tomorrow, especially in countries that want to transform
their economies. They may need to consider three
types of intervention: “early reactive” to tackle immediate skill shortages; “continuing” to tackle the skill
demand for upgrading within existing industries; and
“future-oriented” to supply the skills for long-term
structural change (Fernandez-Stark, Bamber and
Gereffi 2012). Early reactive can be addressed quickly
through on-the-job training, but future-oriented may
call for long-term changes to education. Still, policies
have to be realistic, and changes should be gradual
and sequential to forestall possibly huge misuse of
resources on a system that does not meet industry’s
demands.
The formal education system needs to adjust over
time. Other forms of training by private and public suppliers should fill in the gaps, and firms have to
adopt a “skill culture” through innovation and learning. This will not happen automatically, hence the
need for policy intervention.
Specialized technical skills need to be built on
strong education foundations set during primary
and secondary school, primarily comprising the fundamental academic skills of numeracy and literacy,
as well as behavioural (or soft) skills acquired at an
early age through personal interactions and problem
solving.

skill needs

of knowledge and of offering too many diplomas
in non-required fields. Reconciling the “what is
needed” with the “what can be provided and how”
is possibly the most important challenge in designing skill policies, yet the interplay between supply
and demand is complex. The supply side essentially
reacts to signals from the demand side, but the timing of demand and the lack of innovation strategies
may hamper the speed and nature of the response by
education and training organizations. Without having a complex planning system, the education system will need to develop the capacity to anticipate
upcoming demand – and work towards providing
the upcoming areas of expertise despite facing major
uncertainty as to whether these actually will be the
needed fields, if it is going to provide the required
workforce for structural change and economic
growth.
Aligning skill policies with the broader
socioeconomic agenda
Skill policies have to be aligned with the economic
and social development needs of society, which
requires strong coordination between stakeholders engaged in policy-making – public and private.
Policy-makers have to be aware that the skill policies
may differ greatly depending on a country’s industrialization starting point and goal – the challenges for
a resource-rich unindustrialized country differ greatly
from those for a country trying to escape the middleincome trap.
Many developing countries suffer from coordination failures when designing skill policies, for two
main reasons. First, the government agency developing
the economic agenda is not necessarily the one responsible for executing it. The lack of inter-ministerial
coordination often results in the design of industrial
policies that are unrealistic for the country’s human
resources. Second, the private sector in developing
countries, even if organized, is minimally involved in
policy-making, which again leads to misconceptions
of industry’s skill needs. Thus skill policies become
supply driven.

152

Policy recommendations for skills
As countries differ in many ways, so does the choice
of skill policies. There is no one-fits-all policy mix that
works for all countries. Policies that worked in Asia
many years ago, for example, may not work in Africa
today. The knowledge structure of a country is determined by multiple factors, including formal schooling, in-firm learning and the knowledge acquired and
influenced by social networks such as families and
communities (Nübler 2013b). The sociocultural and
historical context plays a fundamental role that can
lead to failure of policies that have worked elsewhere,
so policy-makers should be cautious when designing
skill policies. Still, they may wish to consider a few
broad thrusts and some other countries’ approaches.
Support development of soft transferable
skills for manufacturing
In Viet  Nam manufacturing employers are not just
looking for technical skills but also for cognitive,
social and behavioural skills. Teamwork and problem-solving skills are considered key for blue-collar
workers, while critical thinking comes out as the
most desired skill for white-collar workers (Bodewig
2012). Mastering English is a top priority in Thai
manufacturing (World Bank 2010). These are just two
examples of how important soft skills have become in
South-East Asian manufacturing.
Indeed, with the growing pace of technological
change in manufacturing, and the shift from routine
manual to more non-routine analytical and interactive
activities, companies now put a premium on a workforce better prepared to learn and absorb new tasks.
Problem-solving attitudes as well as interpersonal skills
such as communication and teamwork have become
crucial for on-the-job learning, to the extent that some
firms have now prioritized these over other technical
education when hiring staff due to the transferability
of skills across sectors (EC 2011; Fernandez-Stark,
Bamber and Gereffi 2012; Murnane and Levy 1996).
While specialized technical skills remain key for
structural change and technological upgrading in
manufacturing, soft transferable skills have become

Complement formal education with technical
and vocational education and training
Over the last few decades there has been a strong
emphasis on technical and vocational education and
training (TVET) to meet the demand for industrial
skills. No substitute for formal education – instead,
TVET builds on it to deliver specialized technical
training. Although TVET covers the whole gamut of
manufacturing skills, the shift from simple assembly
and processing to technology-intensive industries calls
for a skilled workforce capable of operating state-ofthe-art technologies. Tertiary enrolment in technical
subjects, including engineering and mathematics, has
normally been taken as a useful indicator for the availability of skilled labour for highly advanced industry.
But university education has often proved to be
insufficient supplying the skills needed by industry
both because of the rigidity of university curricula in
times where the demand for skills in industry is constantly changing and because of a lack of private sector participation in developing those curricula. There
seems to be a consensus that TVET is usually more
adaptable to industrial needs as the private sector is
often engaged in its design and even execution.2

TVET does not work automatically. In many
instances the suppliers of TVET were unable to
keep up with the skill needs of industry due to sudden changes in demand. If the private sector does
not provide the information continually, it is very
unlikely that TVET suppliers can anticipate changes
in demand and so adjust the training curriculum.
Governments at times assume incorrectly to have
more and better information than private parties on
programmes. Finally, TVET can also fail due to enrolment shortages as families in developing countries may
not be aware of the longer terms benefits of a technical
education (Almeida, Behrman and Robalino 2012).
For TVET to be mainstreamed within the education system in developing countries – and in many
developed ones – TVET programmes have to overcome three main challenges:
•	 They still do not enjoy a good reputation among
the general public, which sees TVET as an alternative for those who do not perform well at school,
rather than as a mechanism that enhances future
employability through the acquisition of industrial
skills.
•	 A variety of public and private bodies offer them,
frequently leading to many uncoordinated efforts
and myriad certifications that can confuse prospective students and employers. Most countries
lack a single body responsible for setting standards
for TVET programmes, not only for their design
but also for execution and monitoring.
•	 Programmes rarely have tracking systems to confirm whether participants have found jobs in
related fields, giving the institutions little feedback on their courses’ relevance and suitability for
graduates.

Education and training policies for creating jobs in manufacturing

a crucial asset for employability, both in and outside
manufacturing.1 Many of these soft skills have to be
developed at an early age, signifying the importance of
supporting policies that establish the learning foundations of the future workforce. More and better schooling will be crucial for manufacturing, and developing soft transferable skills will enhance employment
prospects later on. The non-technical nature of these
skills also calls for changes in the teaching approach.
Traditional “follow the model” methods that emphasized static learning, memorization and imitation are
no longer viable for developing interpersonal skills.
The emphasis should be on critical thinking, problem
solving and the encouragement of teamwork and creativity. The combination of these skills and specialized
technical skills acquired later will provide the best
possible skill mix for employment in highly advanced
manufacturing.

Engage the private sector in designing
technical and vocational education
and training
The involvement of the private sector in TVET is crucial for its success because its involvement is the most
efficient way to link skills to the labour market (DFID
2011). The private sector is not only important by
153

of skill development in manufacturing

providing relevant information on skill needs but also
by taking an active role in shaping the training programmes to make sure they match skill demands more
closely (Box 8.1).
Where the private sector is less strong, there is
still the possibility to develop successful TVET programmes by involving relevant stakeholders. For
instance, in India the Skills Development Initiative,
which aims to provide 1 million workers with employable skills over five years with an additional million workers each year after that, is a public–private
partnership.
Encourage on-the-job training
On-the-job enterprise training is possibly one of the
most important sources of skill development in manufacturing. Training in enterprises, usually provided
to employees after formal education and vocational
training, is a very effective and economical way to
develop the workforce’s industrial skills. The reason
is that manufacturing firms bear the cost of training only to the extent that they expect to reap some
benefits. Such training can take different forms. At
the lower end of the spectrum formal training is rare

and only occurs through informal exchanges with colleagues. In highly advanced sectors training is formalized, becoming an integral part of the worker’s job.3
Apprenticeship schemes have become increasingly
popular as an efficient public–private partnership to
bring industrial skills to the shop floor (Box 8.2). They
are not only responsible for developing skills that are
very specific to individual firms and sectors, but are
thought to be a key reasons for low youth unemployment – as in Austria, Germany and Switzerland,
which have successful dual-training systems. 
In all countries considering this system the private
sector needs to have a key role in designing the training, to ensure that the skills required are being learned
(AU 2007). Economies relying on a large agricultural
sector and with a large informal sector may not find
the dual system suitable, however, as it needs a strong
private sector and a high level of institutional coordination among the parties.
Make financing for training efficient and
equitable
Lack of financing is the main constraint to supplying
high-quality TVET. Governments cannot be expected

Box 8.1	
Involving the private sector in Singapore
Singapore’s vocational and technical education (VTE) is
frequently cited as among the most effective in having
achieved a transformation from an unskilled workforce to
a highly skilled one, in 20 years (Lai and Yap 2004; Lall
2001).
VTE seems to differentiate itself from those in neighbouring economies in one aspect – a private sector role in
the coordinating body (Lai and Yap 2004). Although in the
Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan Province of China
the government is either the principal or only body making decisions on vocational education, the government of
Singapore has ensured that the private sector has a key
role in shaping VTE, and representatives of industry and
labour organizations form a significant part of the coordinating body. This representation allows for a direct and
continual flow of information on changes in the demand
for skills in industry, and teaching curricula can thus be
adapted quickly.

154

Additionally, the system offers traineeship programmes with key industries such as aircraft maintenance
and ship manufacturing. Agreements have been signed
with industry for technology and knowledge transfer
between education centres and industry, to ensure that
teachers remain up to date with industry developments
(Law 2007).
The government-funded Institute of Technical Education – Singapore’s pride in VTE – has become a worldclass institution, known for its quality, values and relevance internationally. Over the years it has changed from
comprising various vocational institutes to three “educational colleges”. With strong industry partnership, 70 percent of the curriculum consisting of practical work and a
wide range of programmes and courses for students, the
Institute strongly emphasizes the suitability of its graduates for future employment (Law 2007).

to meet the whole burden when private returns surpass
social returns. Yet firms, even aware of the benefits of
training, may be unable to bear the associated costs
and risks. This is particularly true for smaller firms in
developing countries.
Governments have to make financing efficient and
equitable, and the best way to do this is by partnering with the private sector. Indirect financing – the
state co-finances training schemes but the private sector takes responsibility for delivering services – has
proved successful. The policy is based on the expected
efficiency and equity gains economy-wide, especially
for manufacturing firms that require a pool of highly
skilled professionals. Two approaches have become
increasingly popular for such co-financing (Box 8.3).
Develop nationwide certification for
manufacturing skills
A large number of uncoordinated efforts to build industrial skills results in duplicity, waste of resources and
confusion among employers and prospective students.
A unified nationwide certification scheme, ideally
under one body, avoids duplication and informs sectors
about the qualifications held by individuals. For these
people such a certificate signals to potential employers
the types of skills they have, which can be particularly
advantageous for youth who do not have experience or
personal contacts, and thus face difficulties in presenting themselves to potential employers. For a firm it is

discouraged at the start of their career, especially as participants are more likely to be those with lower educational
attainment at an earlier stage (Biavaschi et al. 2012).
The best-known example of a dual-training system is
in Germany. It is complex, having developed over many
years. Adequate organizational capacity is required, as is
participation and collaboration of trade unions, the government (including for regulatory frameworks), employers and others. Particularly for employers, such in-house
training can be costly, making it crucial for the advantages
of such a scheme to be well communicated.

a form of quality assurance and allows them to measure and compare skills among applicants (World Bank
2010). Certification also facilitates labour mobility and
creates competition within the labour market.

Education and training policies for creating jobs in manufacturing

Apprenticeship schemes combine classroom vocational
training with practical work experience in the firm. The
strong link with the private sector enables the curriculum
to adapt rapidly to changing demands in industry. The
government offers the classroom courses, and the firm
pays a reduced salary to the participant. After the contract
between the participant and the employer for this work
experience expires, the employer can hire the participant
(or choose not to).
Young people in the scheme have a smoother and
faster transition from education to their first job, which
may be very important in ensuring that they are not

by encouraging growth through training centres,

Governments need to do more to facilitate such
knowledge exchange. (The national and regional
authorities were key in developing training and
R&D centres in the clusters in Box 8.4.) Being part

Clustering
Clusters, often built for firms within a manufacturing
subsector, have started to benefit from their geographical proximity to undergo collective training activities.
This is particularly true in Europe, where clusters such
as the advanced textiles manufacturing cluster in Flanders (Belgium), the Brainport high-tech cluster (the
Netherlands) or the medical technologies cluster in
Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany) are exchanging knowledge and expertise through education and training institutions. As firms collaborate within these clusters, workers are conscious of the different working environments
and conditions among the firms, exerting pressure on
employers to ensure that employees are satisfied.

on how production should take place (Humphrey and

Support private sector–university
collaboration
When skills need to be developed to suit manufacturing’s highly sophisticated activities, such as R&D and
innovation, universities may be crucial in producing
graduates with the right skills, especially in developing countries (World Bank 2010). But as with basic
education, and even TVET in many countries, there
tends to be little collaboration with the private sector
in higher education. Teaching methods are typically
academic in style, denying students the opportunity to
learn practical skills for manufacturing jobs.
So, to develop the higher education system to better suit industry’s needs for higher skills, a variety of
similar policies need to be put in place, like those proposed for general education and TVET systems.

It is important to develop structured

and recognized education and training
accessible for the informal sector

Do not forget the informal economy
Access to formal or recognized TVET is hard for people working in the informal sector or in a micro- or

small enterprise. Training is usually informal, on the
job and with no recognized certification. In Morocco
80 percent of those in the informal sector, whether
employers or employees, had no other skills than those
developed on the job. In Ethiopia virtually nobody in
the informal sector had any kind of formal training
(Walther 2011).
But a significant share of those employed in manufacturing work in the informal sector or within small
firms (many of which operate in the informal economy). Additionally, in many countries the informal
sector is the main entry point for youth for any kind of
employment, even those who have completed higher
education. In Central Africa 60 percent of those who
have undertaken a bachelor’s or master’s course started
their career in the informal sector (Walther 2011).
So it is important to develop structured and recognized education and training accessible for the informal sector to develop the sector, increase its productivity and strengthen the link between the informal
and formal economies, making it easier for workers to
move from the former to the latter. For such training
to be effective, it should focus on addressing the skill

jobs for them is important for three main reasons: joblessness at that stage is a strong predictor of unemployment later; it means a loss in the experience component
of human capital formation; and it may discourage some
of them, causing them to drop out of the labour market.
So supporting youth is very important, whether
the political focus is on industrial competitiveness
through skills or on social policies (Box 8.5). The
majority of education and training for manufacturing
employment and the policies suggested in this chapter
are by nature more directed towards youth, particularly TVET and apprenticeship.
But these policies may not always be enough to
cater to all needs. In developing countries particularly – where general educational attainment tends
to be lower and students are more likely to have fewer
years of education – second-chance initiatives can
be particularly beneficial, especially for those on low
incomes and in the informal sector.

needs of the informal sector in particular, in addition
to enabling access. But as the informal sector has a
larger share of young people, women and less-skilled
workers, and stretches across all sectors of the economy, a flexible approach is required to offer different
schemes to match the sector’s heterogeneity (Gibson
2013).4 Training must also be recognized nationally,
with participants receiving certification.

Vocational Training suggests that TVET has a
stronger positive effect on firms in manufacturing
than in other sectors (CEDEFOP 2011). Studying
the effects of vocational education in Ghana,

have undergone vocational education have higher
productivity than graduates with only secondary

are more likely to train; and education attainment

capabilities of employers – capable workforce and

Chapter 9

International cooperation

Manufacturing industry worldwide is facing challenges, most fundamentally generating large numbers
of jobs while taking into account the impact of climate
change, which requires a major transformation and
restructuring of industrial activity (see Chapter 6). Yet
many developing countries and economies in transition lack the necessary human, financial and technical
resources to make this shift – a shortfall that international cooperation can help address.
After discussing the impact on developing countries of a national policy space that has been curtailed
by international agreements on trade, this chapter
looks at international cooperation mediated through
institutions like the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UNIDO and
the International Labour Organization (ILO), particularly in three areas: liberating economic resources
for investment in manufacturing, facilitating crossborder adoption of labour standards and generating
learning effects on industrial restructuring.
International cooperation in the first of these
areas contributes to economic development by providing and protecting investments, often through
bilateral investment treaties (BITs). These treaties
have fast become a fixture in regulating international trade, and because they have a measured,
positive impact on foreign direct investment (FDI),
they have proved useful for regulating cross-border investments. Further, BITs and other investment regulations may also improve conditions for
manufacturing-related employment generation,
which international organizations can encourage.
In the second area cooperation can help harmonize,
strengthen and enforce labour standards globally,
particularly in the fairly new area of private sustainability standards. It can also assist in generating and
sharing knowledge – the third area – where emerging platforms and forums that aim to promote industrial development can serve as vehicles, as well as the
traditional multilateral bodies.

This chapter also stresses the need to ensure that
an economic dimension appears on the development
agenda after 2015, unlike the original Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). As the world considers how to move beyond the MDGs, the opportunity
arises to build a framework with goals anchored in all
of the three dimensions of sustainable development –
economic, social and environmental.
The trade-off between national policy
autonomy and trade liberalization
To address global environmental and economic challenges, manufacturing industry needs to be transformed and restructured into sustainable industry.
But to guide and as necessary stimulate this transformation, national regulators need policy autonomy, a
position that may be at odds with international cooperation through trade agreements.
Such agreements seek to reduce barriers to trade
and enhance trade through legally binding rules. Yet
trade liberalization is not itself the ultimate goal. Even
the first paragraph of the preamble to the Marrakesh
Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization
(WTO) refers to trade in accord with the objective of
sustainable development and the protection and preservation of the environment.1 International cooperation, especially through trade and investment agreements, aims to lead to regulatory convergence, which
requires countries to relinquish some of their policy
autonomy (Trebilcock and Howse 1998), thus removing certain policy options from a regulator’s arsenal.
The reduction of policy autonomy can manifest
itself in two ways. First, it may no longer be possible
to use a certain policy instrument, such as subsidies.
Second, a national regulator may have to refrain from
introducing new (or applying current) legislation to
protect non-trade policy objectives such as health or
the environment.
A clear example of the former is the WTO
Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures
159

International cooperation

– a powerful and frequently used policy instrument –
which prohibits governments to use subsidies under
certain conditions (Coppens 2009, 2013). Similarly,
many export restrictions are only allowed when they
follow the relevant rules in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Karapinar 2011).
The debate on the balance between policy autonomy and trade liberalization is especially heated in
cases of the latter type where measures not directly
related to trade are assessed for their compliance with
trade rules, and these cases give rise to some of the
most contentious decisions by the dispute settlement
organs of the WTO.
But it would be unfair to qualify WTO dispute
settlement as in itself hostile to industrial policies,
particularly those related to sustainable industrialization. Considering that the WTO has identified more
than 100 trade-restrictive measures, which include
some measures with industrial environment in mind,
enacted by Group of Twenty countries in only seven
months, the disputes before the WTO are merely the
tip of the iceberg (EC 2013; WTO 2013). Still, the
issue of policy autonomy remains crucial for the legitimacy of trade agreements.

Bilateral investment treaties –
protecting and promoting foreign
direct investment
International cooperation can contribute to manufacturing employment by legally protecting foreign
investors.2 As the World Investment Report 2011 puts
it: “Investment promotion policy can be an important means to build productive capacity in developing
countries” (UNCTAD 2011, p. 105).
FDI influences employment in manufacturing in
several ways: by increasing the number of jobs through
direct investment in production facilities; by lifting
productivity through knowledge spillovers (World
Bank 2013a) and by raising the quality of jobs, especially through higher wages and better working conditions (Mosley 2011). But as shown in Chapter 5 and
touched on again in Box 9.1, FDI is not a one-way bet.
FDI represents a commitment of capital: such
investment transfers financial, technological and
informational resources from owners in one country to new subsidiaries, plants, offices or owners in
a second – host – country. Investing directly in a
host country allows firms to circumvent complications associated with servicing foreign markets and

Box 9.1	
A few warning lights for foreign direct investment
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is not the unmitigated boon
for accelerated economic development that some claim it
to be. First, it can crowd out domestic investment – that
is, investment from foreign sources discourages domestic
investment by host-country nationals (Caves 1996). As de
Backer and Sleuweagen (2003, p. 71) put it: foreign firms
paying higher wages “skim the domestic labour market
and decrease the labour supply for domestic companies,
at least in the short term”.
Second and relatedly, newer analyses are finding weaker, negative links between innovation and FDI
inflows. This is a significant step backwards for FDI’s proponents, as a principal rationale for liberalizing access to
FDI is for the domestic market to gain from technological
spillovers. Jin, Garcia and Salomon (2013), studying the
Spanish manufacturing sector over 1990–2002, find that
as inward FDI flows increase, and despite rises in total

160

factor productivity and labour productivity, innovation
decreases, measured by the numbers of patent applications and of new products launched on the market. States
may then be faced with a decision: support productivity
increases by encouraging FDI or favour innovation by limiting FDI.
Thus the economic gains promised by FDI are less
clear cut than some supporters argue: crowding out and
stifled innovation create hurdles for domestic employment generation by eliminating the organic processes
of firm creation and growth. Yet these issues are largely
observed in the short term: over longer periods, crowdingout effects diminish and a measurable uptick appears in
domestic entrepreneurship through learning, networking
and linkage effects between domestic and foreign firms
(de Backer and Sleuweagen 2003).

Bilateral investment treaties aim

to protect the sources of FDI and so
stimulate investment and create jobs

multilateral cooperation in 1998, and OECD states
subsequently returned to strictly bilateral approaches
to regulating FDI.
Generally positive impacts of bilateral
investment treaties
The question remains whether BITs positively – if at
all – affect FDI flows. Several authors approach this
issue, employing political, economic and legal perspectives. Neumeyer and Spess (2005), for example,
analyse the effect of BITs on FDI flows to developing
countries. They find a positive relationship between
BITs and FDI, indicating that an agreement – all
other factors held constant – increases FDI flows to a
BIT signatory. Importantly, FDI inflows are not isolated to just the BIT signatory partners, so this result
includes FDI inflows from countries without BITs.
More recent findings also tend to find a similarly
positive relationship, though these results are contingent on political factors. In fact, most of the more
recent studies, such Büthe and Milner (2009), depart
from traditional trade and legal analyses of BITs to
concentrate on political conditions and their role in
shaping BITs and FDI. Along this seam, Tobin and
Rose-Ackerman (2011) report that political conditions
are the most important factors for attracting FDI, but
also that a BIT serves as a guarantee to improve political stability of domestic institutions. In this way BITs
are capable of attracting FDI when signed between
developed (FDI-exporting) and developing (FDIimporting) states. Still, they find that legal institutions
and mechanisms provided for in BITs complement, but
do not supplant, sound, functioning domestic institutions in the developing country partner.
Mixed results indicate that other factors influence
FDI inflows, but as Büthe and Milner (2009) note,
BITs are now standard means for states to bilaterally
coordinate FDI policies. In this way investors increasingly identify BITs as a prerequisite when scouting for
new countries for outward FDI (Büthe and Milner
2009). Most notable, though, are BITs’ impacts on
regulatory governance and market liberalization. The
terms they embody dismantle investment barriers

9
International cooperation

fragmented production processes (Helpman, Melitz
and Yeaple 2003). When FDI roots a firm in a foreign
market through a subsidiary or similar entity, firms
tap local labour and supply markets to bolster output.
But foreign direct investors run risks, including
expropriation and unfair treatment, as FDI host states
maintain the legal right to decide how to treat incoming foreign investment – a right upheld by the UN
Charter in 1974 – meaning that FDI-importing states
have full discretion over the conditions, tax rates,
property rights, dispute-settlement procedures and
treatment afforded to international investors.
Rules established in BITs allay these concerns by
requiring states to compensate for expropriation and
allowing repatriation of assets. To avert discrimination
against foreign investment, BITs also extend national
treatment, most-favoured nation treatment and the
like to investments defined as FDI in the BIT. BITs
thus aim to protect the sources of FDI and so stimulate investment and create jobs. They mitigate risks
and credibly demonstrate the host country’s commitment to assuring the legal and domestic conditions to
house FDI safely. Governments accede to these stringent conditions because the prospects of FDI entice,
promising technology transfers and domestic job
creation (Elkins, Guzman and Simmons 2006). They
are willing to subject themselves to multilaterally supported dispute-settlement mechanisms.
The number of BITs has surged in the last couple of decades as the main tool for states looking to
facilitate FDI, from a mere 447 in 1990 to more than
2,000 unique, bilateral agreements in 2000 and more
than 3,000 in 2011 (UNCTAD 2011). Recognizing
this increasingly dense web, discussions arose within
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) to harmonize FDI policies
in the mid-1990s. The result was a draft agreement
called the Multilateral Agreement on Investment,
which attempted to institutionalize FDI promotion
and protection policies within the OECD and to provide internal dispute resolution mechanisms (OECD
1998). But incompatibility among states’ preferences
for the contents of BITs stifled progress towards

161

“

International bodies have an opportunity to

bolster states’ benefits from bilateral investment
treaties by buttressing coordination efforts

9
International cooperation

by legally binding signatories to non-discriminatory
behaviour towards foreign investors and unparalleled
permission for FDI entry. A by-product of relegating
dispute-settlement processes to international bodies,
BITs strengthen the regulatory quality of their policies on investment.
Allee and Peinhardt (2011) offer more conclusive
evidence of BITs’ impact on FDI. They find that signing a BIT increases FDI inflows to signatory states,
but this result is conditional, too. An economy’s FDI
picks up if the state is neither accused nor found guilty
of violating the agreement’s terms. States taken to the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) see a significant decrease in FDI
inflows no matter the number of BITs they have
signed. Allee and Peinhardt (2011) also note that
states must be able to support BIT clauses institutionally to enjoy the benefits (employment and otherwise)
of greater FDI.
Persuading developing countries of the
benefits of bilateral investment treaties
Despite the sharp rise in numbers of BITs signed in the
last two decades, many countries (mainly developing)
have failed to be among the parties. International bodies have an opportunity to bolster states’ benefits from
them in four ways, by buttressing coordination efforts.
First, investment-related international cooperation
can be multilateral or bilateral. Multilateral agreements are far better for efficiency and economic benefit, but are much harder to conclude and none is likely
in the near future. Here is where international organizations can initially help: they can serve as a vehicle or
forum for aggregating interests. As seen, multilateral
efforts in the OECD in the later 1990s failed due to
irreconcilable differences on investment protection.
Since then the number of parties in BITs, and thus
with “unique preferences” on protection, has risen,
complicating prospects for a multilateral agreement.
International organizations can instead support
bilateral and regional efforts by extending their databases on investment agreements and ensuring transparent reporting of agreements signed, cases disputed

162

and the firms and locations of FDI. Such data are valuable for states considering new negotiations or firms
seeking new investment locations. This will aid developing countries especially, as knowledge on standard
conditions for national treatment and disputes can
help them negotiate better. Moreover, understanding the public nature of such data encourages states
to comply more rigidly with the agreements they have
signed, which in turn increases the credibility of their
commitments (Büthe and Milner 2009).
Second, international organizations can provide
consultative services to states interested in pursuing
BITs or other investment agreements. Negotiations
often begin with a template that states keep on file
and alter according to the partners targeted for a particular agreement. But developing states often lack the
administrative capacity to fully develop such a template or, worse still, lack the administrative capacity
to negotiate with states holding greater bargaining
power. To this end, international organizations can
lend expertise to developing states to institute a wellrounded BIT template or to train administrative staff
responsible for negotiations on strategies and typical
agreement clauses. UNCTAD and UNIDO seem
particularly fit for such a task, as its in-house expertise on BITs is substantial. For example, UNIDO’s
Investment Promotion Programme has been providing advice and capacity building for 30 years to investment promotion officers in the developing world, helping start international industrial partnerships through
FDI in developing countries and establish investment
and technology promotion units and agencies in
developed and developing countries.
Third, international organizations can disseminate
knowledge on investment agreements. Although violations of BITs’ terms trigger marked reputational damage that hurts FDI inflows, developing states largely
consider BITs ceremonial agreements with little or
non-strictly binding terms (Allee and Peinhardt 2011).
Here ICSID can disseminate information to states less
keen on litigation (usually developing countries) on
how to use ICSID to settle disputes, by creating a lending system for states burdened by dispute-settlement

“

International organizations should also

ensure that their capacity building has a focus on
technical expertise in bilateral investment treaties

Private sustainability standards
Another area for international cooperation is in international labour standards, particularly for manufacturing. They have a long history, often tied to the

ILO, which urges their global adoption. Thus over
many decades a body of international rules has developed on labour standards including wages, worker
safety and collective bargaining. Beyond the ILO’s
norms and procedures to enforce them, trade unions,
nongovernment organizations and social movements
have put enforcement high on the political agenda,
and often criticize national and international governmental agencies for not enforcing them properly (de
Bakker et al. 2013; Keck and Sikkink 1998), as well as
many leading firms and brand owners. Social activists’
discovery that reputation was a firm’s tangible asset
that they could easily harm spurred a proliferation of
social protests, such as the Clean Clothes Campaign,
directed at apparel and textile firms (Bartley 2003).
These criticisms prompted firms in the early
1990s to respond with new forms of private governance, which aimed to assure international standards
along the whole value chain (Abbott and Snidal
2009; Mattli and Woods 2009). First, many firms
established codes of conduct and initiatives on corporate social responsibility (CSR; Box 9.2). In 2003
the World Bank estimated that firms had more than
1,000 codes of conduct, many in manufacturing

9
International cooperation

costs and by advising states negotiating BITs on the
implications of clauses related to dispute settlement.
Fourth, academic studies indicate BITs’ positive influence on FDI flows, noting that signing and
fulfilling the terms of a BIT increase FDI flows to
partner countries (Haftel 2010), but only if the states
show institutional quality (Büthe and Milner 2009),
especially in the judiciary (Tobin and Rose-Ackerman
2010). So international organizations with expertise
in establishing domestic institutions, ensuring their
quality and monitoring their functioning can intervene to improve institutional quality where most pertinent to BITs. Tapping the data and resources of bodies like the European Commission, ICSID, OECD,
UNCTAD, UNIDO and World Bank can translate
vast quantities of information into capacity building
for domestic institutions. International organizations
should also ensure that their capacity building has a
focus on technical expertise in BITs.

Box 9.2	
Corporate social responsibility and industrial restructuring
In a world attuned to voluntary regulation, corporate social
responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a promising tool to
incorporate environmental and social concerns in industrial
restructuring. But large multinationals dominate the CSR
movement, a concern for the United Nations and its specialized agencies, which aim to bring small and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs) into the movement. Multinationals often
invest heavily in CSR policies and campaigns, putting pressure on smaller companies that supply them or struggle
to make their own way in the international market. Already
grappling with requirements to meet strict standards on
food safety and quality, many SMEs lack the expertise or
finance to build sustainable business and employment practices. Without help to create socially responsible and sustainable practices, they risk being left behind as big market
players look to suppliers who can meet these criteria.
Working with large private companies, international organizations such as the International Labour

Organization and UNIDO are adapting their technical
assistance programmes to include the CSR needs of
SMEs in their projects (ILO 2013; UNIDO 2013b). They
receive support in better management techniques, productivity and safer, sustainable production and labour
practices, which should create a win-win situation for both
suppliers and buyers as large companies can demonstrate their commitment to social inclusion and to society
by bringing smaller suppliers further into the value chain.
From the point of view of SMEs, if companies achieve
lower absenteeism, fewer accidents and better working
conditions, along with lower energy consumption and
waste, then competitiveness as well as social and environmental responsibility can go together. In practice these
projects show that the business case for CSR for smaller
companies is no different from that of large corporations –
better productivity, morale and competitiveness.

and international organizations to create

subsectors such as textiles, footwear and wood processing, and many more have come about since. But
many codes have been attacked for being too weak
and serving as mere “window dressing” (Wells 2007),
encouraging yet new forms of private governance that
brought together actors and stakeholders.
Besides those from multilateral organizations,
many private initiatives emerged such as the Fair
Labor Association and Social Accountability 8000.
These pioneering labelling and certification schemes
involved firms, non-governmental organizations,
trade unions, governments and international organizations to create new forms of international regulation
(Abbott and Snidal 2009).
Labour standards also spilled over into many
other initiatives aimed at promoting such “private
sustainability standards” through certification and
eco-labelling (Abbott and Snidal 2009; Marx 2011).3
Transnational certification initiatives aim to implement labour standards in global production processes
and communicate to consumers across national and
regional markets that certified products have been
made according to these standards.
This proliferation of labels and certification systems was driven by several interrelated factors, including the commitment of multinational firms to CSR
(O’Rourke 2012) and that of governments to support
private sustainability standards through public procurement legislation.
Many such standards now cover multiple sectors,
with many variations, but common characteristics
are an organization that defines social and ecological
standards – and procedures to check that products
or processes conform to these standards. When they
conform, a certificate is awarded (sometimes used
for advertising and promotion), and here differences
emerge in stringency of standards (Fransen 2012;
O’Rourke 2003) and the certification procedure
(Gereffi, Garcia-Johnson and Sasser 2001).
Impact on labour conditions
Private sustainability standards were initially welcomed as “one of the most innovative and startling

164

institutional designs of the past 50 years” (Cashore,
Auld and Newsom 2004) and were regarded as
key instruments in ratcheting up labour standards
internationally (Sabel, Fung and O’Rourke 2000).
But doubts have emerged more recently over their
potential to improve labour conditions in developing
countries.
Some reservations stem from journalistic exposés of certified factories that breach the standards,
most dramatically recent fires in garment factories
in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which killed many hundreds of workers. Others come from the lack of credible empirical data that these systems are effective.
Effectiveness in this context is often measured
along two dimensions: problem solving and process
(Marx, Bécault and Wouters 2012; Tikina and Innes
2008). The former is the degree to which the problem that prompted the certification initiative is solved
(often compliance with ILO conventions and standards); the latter evaluates the adoption rate of certification initiatives by firms (the number of certified
firms).
On problem solving there is some evidence that
private sustainability standards improve working
conditions. For the Forest Stewardship Council,
de Azevedo and de Freitas (2003) analyse the impact
of certification on working conditions of workers in
the Amazon basin in Brazil and find that in certified
forests the logging camps and safety of forest operations are significantly better than in non-certified
forests. But some “on the ground” reports or testimonies call into question the thoroughness of audited
factories’ compliance with labour conditions, questioning their impact (Esbenshade 2004; Locke 2013;
O’Rourke 2000).
For process effectiveness, annual reports of the
leading initiatives on private sustainability standards
show that the number of certified factories is limited,
pointing to a very low overall adoption rate given that
many retailers work with several thousands of contractors, each with several subcontractors. In addition,
most certification is in only a few countries such as
Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and Viet Nam.4

Generating and sharing knowledge
Multilateral organizations are becoming key knowledge managers and coordinators, bringing together
actors to share their information and learn from others. International cooperation on knowledge sharing is
expected to enhance mutual learning and peer review,
identify good practices and their conditions for transferability and develop joint policy initiatives or identify areas where joint initiatives can reinforce states’
current policies (Tholoniat 2010).
The key focus in sharing knowledge is on managing and coordinating knowledge (Abbott and Snidal
2010). Several authors propose a comprehensive
approach to knowledge management with a strong
emphasis on a networked approach to learning and

improved network management (Rayner, Buck
and Katila 2011). The former is necessary because
improved knowledge management does not necessarily lead to learning. A key issue is bridging knowledge
generation and use, which can be achieved through
networked learning platforms defined “as an integrated set of services that provide information, tools
and resources to support policy learning” (Rayner,
Buck and Katila 2011, p. 141).
These knowledge platforms aim to promote structural change and green growth strategies, including
UNIDO’s Green Industry Platform. This is a voluntary multi-stakeholder partnership designed to
provide a framework for participants, individually or
in groups, to take specific and measurable action to
advance environmentally sustainable approaches and
employment in industry (GIP 2013).

Private sustainability standards and
international cooperation
Thus how these mechanisms are playing out in the
real world is largely unknown. No sound, overall
quantitative studies – to our knowledge – exist that
estimate the effects of these mechanisms on labour
conditions or employment. The scattered available
studies give some evidence on certain aspects but
no consolidated picture (Locke 2013; Reich 2008;
Vogel 2008). Here lies an important role for multilateral organizations, especially a new international
body, the United Nations Forum on Sustainability
Standards (Box 9.3).

Sustainable manufacturing and
employment post-2015
As the world considers how to move beyond the
MDGs after 2015, the opportunity arises to build a
framework with goals anchored in the three dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social
and environmental. The eight MDGs were intended
to unify pursuit of these three dimensions, but an economic dimension was missing and a target on employment was only added in 2008 (UN System Task
Team 2012). Generating new employment remains a

United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards
The United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards
(UNFSS) is a new platform to generate knowledge and
information on private sustainability standards with a
particular focus on their potential contribution to development. It is a joint initiative of the Food and Agriculture
Organization, UNIDO, International Trade Centre, United
Nations Environment Programme and United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development. UNFSS can make
a contribution in several areas.
First, it could pool data and research on the effectiveness of these systems and their potential employment impact. In doing so, it might consider expanding

the systems’ focus (not only agri-foods) to the sectors
in manufacturing where private standards are important,
such as textiles, apparel, leather, wood products, paper,
chemicals and furniture.
UNFSS could also consider developing a watchdog
function for private sustainability standards. Some authors
have argued that these systems differ in several aspects
directly related to their effectiveness and potential employment, in numbers and quality (O’Rourke 2003; Sabel, Fung
and O’Rourke 2001; van Waarden 2011). Most important,
these systems differ in how they enforce standards.

pivotal global social concern, however: the first indicative findings from the United Nations–led consultations on the post-2015 development agenda, through
which more than 200,000 people from across the
world contributed their views on the ideal development priorities after the expiry of the MDGs, show
that job creation will remain a major social challenge,
encompassing almost all economies well beyond 2015
(UNDG 2013). The post-2015 agenda thus offers a
new opportunity for states to recouple considerations
for sustainable manufacturing and employment with
the focus on human development that dominated the
original MDG programme, by recommitting to the
economic dimensions of development.
Four challenges stand out: concerns about the
nature of the relationship among growth, equality and
development; perceptions by some parties of historical over-emphasis on economic globalization and the
market or on the role of public policy in economic
activity; uncertainty about the environmental and
resource impacts of expanding the productive activities of developing countries; and fear of obscuring the
clarity and simplicity of the outcome-oriented MDGs.
All need to be squarely addressed in the post-2015 process (UN 2013c).
The first steps in this direction are evident in the
United Nations High Level Panel of Eminent Persons
on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which combines global development and sustainability with provisions and goals for industry and trade.5 Reflecting
on the accomplishments achieved and the hurdles
encountered under the MDG programme, the Panel
outlined five transformative shifts. One transformation specifically links “sustained, long term, inclusive
growth” to overcoming the challenges of unemployment, resource security and adaptation to climate
change and calls for the transformation of economies
for jobs and inclusive growth (UN 2013b). Targeted
efforts to meet these goals hold the potential to provide 47  million more workers with good jobs and
livelihoods and to equip 200 million more young people with the skills they need to get good work (UN
2013b). Following the Panel’s report, the General

Assembly reaffirmed the essential contribution of
industrial development and employment to achieving
internationally agreed development goals and called
for “giving appropriate consideration to the issue of
industrial development in the elaboration of the development agenda beyond 2015” (UN 2013c, p. 3).
The findings of the Panel and the implications
from other post-2015 processes such as the Open
Working Group on Sustained and Inclusive Economic
Growth, Infrastructure and Industrialization indicate
that clear action from international organizations can
aid in addressing these concerns as well as building the
capabilities and labour forces that will allow countries
to resolve these global development challenges.
Fully bringing sustained, inclusive and sustainable
economic growth, manufacturing and employment
into the post-2015 development framework means
paying careful attention to the globalization of production, trade, technology and finance that has made
manufacturing more international and made it harder
for developing countries to compete internationally. A
strategy based on developing the productive resources,
entrepreneurial capabilities and production linkages
that together determine the capacity of a country to
produce goods and services and enable it to grow and
develop could set the stage for a new development partnership (UNCTAD 2010b). Along these lines, Japan
has proposed a post-2015 Pact for Global Wellbeing,
prioritizing growth that is green, inclusive, shared and
knowledge based (Berg and Melamed 2012).
These visions of a future where economic growth
and manufacturing employment are more stable, inclusive, sustainable and equitable arguably contrast with
the more “quick-win” approach of the MDG era. It
remains to be seen to what extent the General Assembly
will adequately resolve these issues when it ultimately
decides on the post-2015 development agenda during
its 69th session opening in September 2014.

Chapter 10

Trends in manufacturing
value added
Since the start of this century industrializing economies have accounted for a growing share of the world’s
manufacturing value added (MVA). This trend is as
much the result of a gradual shift of production from
industrialized to industrializing countries to benefit
from cheaper labour, largely improved infrastructure
and lower social costs, as it is a reflection of the growth
of industrializing countries’ domestic markets for
industrial goods due to higher incomes and a fast-rising middle class.
The world’s MVA reached an all-time high of
$8,900 billion in 2012 (16.7 percent of global GDP),
recovering fully from the sharp contraction of 2008–
2009 caused by the global economic and financial
crisis (Figure 10.1).1 MVA’s share in GDP in industrialized countries fell from 16.4 percent in 1990 to
15.0 percent in 2012, while it rose from 16.5 percent
to 21.3 percent in industrializing countries.2
In manufacturing, globalization of production and
the accompanying trade liberalization seem to benefit

industrializing countries, bringing in more financial
resources, supporting economic growth and generating employment for a growing population, if at the
risk of increasing their vulnerability to external shocks.
Conversely, some industrialized countries are facing
the tougher task of having to adapt to the new world
economic scenario with stagnating growth, budgetary
constraints, unemployment and social unrest.
Manufacturing in industrializing
countries
Between 1992 and 2012 global MVA nearly doubled,
from $4,960 billion to $8,900 billion, averaging 3 percent annual growth. While MVA expanded by a mere
1.8 percent a year in industrialized countries, below
their 2.1  percent annual GDP growth rate for the
period, it rose more than three-fold in industrializing
countries, at an annual rate of 6.4 percent, faster than
their 5.0 percent a year GDP growth rate (Table 10.1).
The outcome was a near-doubling in the share in world
MVA held by industrializing countries, from 18 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in 2012 (Figure 10.2) and a
corresponding retreat of industrialized countries from
the world’s manufacturing scene, underscoring the
structural changes taking place in both groups.
These long-term trends conceal a clear change
of pattern around the turn of the century, coinciding with the accession of China to the World Trade
Organization and the increased trade liberalization
and globalization of production that ensued. Over
1992–2002 the annual growth of world MVA averaged 2.9 percent, whereas over 2002–2012 it averaged
3.1 percent. Accompanying this seemingly minor difference was a remarkable acceleration in MVA growth
in industrializing countries, from an average annual
5.3 percent over 1992–2002 to 7.4 percent over 2002–
2012. This surge was more than enough to offset the
deceleration in MVA growth in industrialized economies, which fell from an average annual 2.3 percent to
1.4 percent over the same periods.

China sustained extremely high but stable MVA
growth throughout both periods, with annual rates
averaging 11.5 percent over 1992–2002 and 11.3 percent
over 2002–2012, respectively, in itself an extraordinary
performance but not an explanation for the change of
pattern. Instead, it is other industrializing countries such
as India (6.9 percent over 1992–2002; 8.2 percent over
2002–2012), Turkey (3.0 percent; 6.0 percent), Poland
(8.0  percent; 8.9  percent), Argentina (–1.3  percent;
7.4 percent), Belarus (2.0 percent; 10.1 percent), Peru
(3.9 percent; 6.5 percent) and Bangladesh (6.7 percent;

7.8 percent) that have seen a sharp acceleration of MVA
growth since 2002 and are thus responsible for the
increased dynamism. Given that it was in the second
period when the economic and financial crisis set on, the
emerging pattern gains in significance.
Despite the gain in world MVA share, manufacturing performance among industrializing countries
and regions varies widely. China increased its share in
global MVA nearly five-fold over 1992–2012, reaching 17.5 percent, and confirmed its role as the secondlargest manufacturer behind the United States. India

also had an impressive performance (though from a
much lower base), with its share in global MVA growing four-fold in the same period and attaining 2.3 percent in 2012.
East Asia and the Pacific ($1,810  billion)
accounted for 58 percent of industrializing country
MVA in 2012, almost doubling its weight in 20 years

and drawing largely on China’s performance. South
and Central Asia ($294  billion), the second-most
dynamic region, managed to keep its industrializing
country MVA share at 9  percent. By contrast, over
1992–2012 the industrializing country MVA share of
Latin America and the Caribbean ($517 billion) fell
by half from 35 percent to 17 percent, as years of economic restructuring under extreme liberalization and
financial tightness drove economic activity away from
manufacturing and into commodities and services. A
similar phenomenon is observed in Europe ($186 billion in 2012), where the industrializing country MVA
share tumbled from 10 percent in 1992 to 6 percent
in 2012 as most of its countries struggled with the
demands of restructuring following the adoption of a
market economy. The Middle East and North Africa
($219 billion) and Sub-Saharan Africa ($84 billion)
performed better but still lost some of their share in
industrializing country MVA over the past 20 years.
Manufacturing in industrializing countries is geographically highly concentrated, with the five leading economies accounting for 70.9  percent of total
production in 2012, up from 52.7  percent in 1992
(Figure 10.3). The high and sustained MVA growth
in China over this period (11.4 percent on average) is
behind its emergence as the factory of the world: in

Trends in manufacturing value added

2012, 50  percent of industrializing-country manufactured goods was produced in China. Of all other
large industrializing economy manufacturers, only
India (7.4 percent average annual MVA growth) kept
pace with China’s expansion. It gained MVA share
to become the second-leading manufacturer among
industrializing economies, superseding Mexico and
Brazil, which saw their MVA shares fall more than half
from 11.7 percent and 10.5 percent in 1992 to 5.7 percent and 4.9 percent in 2012. Turkey’s steady MVA

Trends in manufacturing value added

174

Industrialized and industrializing countries exhibited similar trends, with their share of resourcebased products declining and that of medium- and
high-tech products rising over 2002–2011. Low-tech
manufacturing maintained its MVA share of around
25 percent over 2002–2011 worldwide but there was
a substantial relocation of production from industrialized to industrializing countries, mainly to China, in
search of lower labour costs and closer access to rapidly
growing markets.
The rate at which industrializing countries have
modified their industrial structure and, especially,
shifted from resource-based manufacturing over
2002–2011 is particularly noteworthy. Their share of
these products fell from 39.7 percent to 30.3 percent
over the period and matched in 2012 the weight of
resource-based manufacturing in industrialized countries in 2002. Equally noteworthy is the persistent
concentration of medium- and high-tech manufacturing in industrialized countries. The recent economic
crisis hit resource-based and low-tech manufacturing
in these countries hard, but the production of technologically complex goods seems to have persisted. By
2011 the share of these products in the industrialized
countries’ MVA had risen to 53 percent.
Regionally, South and Central Asia has experienced a substantial reduction in the share of both
resource-based (to 24.6 percent in 2012) and low-tech
products (to 32.8 percent), and an increase in the share
of medium- and high-tech products (from 31.6 percent to 42.7 percent), largely relying on the transformation of the manufacturing base in India with more
technologically advanced products. East Asia and the
Pacific already had a fairly high share of mediumand high-tech products in 2002, which increased to
41.6 percent in 2011 as other economies in the region
joined China in producing technologically complex
goods for global value chains and production networks. The relocation of low-tech production from
industrialized countries, mainly but not exclusively to
China, accounts for the expansion of the MVA share
of these products in the region from 23.9 percent in
2002 to 31.1 percent in 2011.

Europe and the Middle East and North Africa
exhibit a similar pattern of shedding resource-based
manufacturing (the respective shares fell to 38.4 percent and 40.3  percent in 2011) and embracing
medium- and high-tech production (the respective
shares rose to 30.1 percent and 32.7 percent in 2011),
but they still have a long way to go to reach average
industrializing-country shares for both categories.
Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan
Africa have shown the least change in their manufacturing base in terms of technological complexity of
products over 2002–2011: as in 2002, in 2011 they
were heavily concentrated in producing resource-based
goods (with shares of 40.6 percent and 49.0 percent,
respectively), and marginally increased their mediumand high-tech manufacturing (to 34.1  percent and
26.1 percent, respectively).
Manufacturing value added by
industry sector
In 2011 the dominant manufacturing sectors worldwide were food and beverages (11.6 percent), chemicals and chemical products (11.2 percent), machinery
and equipment (8.9  percent), basic metals (8.6  percent) and radio, television and communication equipment (8.3 percent; Table 10.3). The last two had made
significant gains over 2002–2011 thanks to the higher
demand for basic metals derived from the acceleration
of MVA growth in industrializing countries and the
global surge in demand for electronic devices. Fifteen
manufacturing sectors registered a decrease in their
MVA share worldwide over 2002–2011, from a combined 70.4 percent to 62.0 percent, including mainly
traditional manufacturing sectors such as food and
beverages, textiles, wood products, and paper and
printing, but also coke and refined petroleum products, chemicals, rubber, non-metallic products, fabricated metal products, furniture and even motor vehicles. The only seven sectors that increased their MVA
share, from a combined 29.4 percent to 38.0 percent,
were largely advanced manufacturing such as machinery and equipment; office, accounting and computing
machinery; electrical machinery; radio, television and

which confirms the shift towards production with
higher technological complexity worldwide.
In industrializing countries the leading sectors in
2011 were basic metals (15.1 percent), food and beverages (12.1 percent) and chemicals and chemical products (10.4 percent). The near doubling of the share of
basic metals in a short time (from 8.2 percent in 2002)
is an indicator of the impact that the pull effect of
accelerated manufacturing in industrializing countries
is having on resource-producing countries. Machinery
and equipment (7.2 percent) and radio, television and

communication equipment (6.1 percent) also showed
large gains in MVA share.
In 2002 industrialized countries were generally the largest producers (52  percent or more) in all
manufacturing sectors (Table 10.4). The substantial
industrialization efforts and expansion of markets in
industrializing countries since 2002, coupled with
the repercussions of the recent crisis on industrialized
countries, have produced a significant shift in the distribution of manufacturing activities worldwide, and in
2011 industrializing countries accounted for more than
two-thirds (70 percent or more) of world production
of low-tech products in labour-intensive sectors such as

the board over 2002–2011, industrializing countries
easily doubled or even trebled their world share in many
manufacturing sectors, either by relocating existing production from industrialized countries or starting new
production. But industrialized countries still maintain

Among industrializing countries China

has become the uncontested leader in all 22
industrial sectors, accounting for more than
50 percent of industrializing countries’ total
manufacturing value added in 18 of them

10
Trends in manufacturing value added

2011. Other industrializing countries among top-five
leaders in global manufacturing included Argentina,
Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey.
Among industrializing countries China has
become the uncontested leader in all 22 industrial
sectors, accounting for more than 50 percent of industrializing countries’ total MVA in 18 of them. When
China is excluded, India leads in four out of the five
fastest growing sectors and is among the top three in
13 industrial sectors, the same as Brazil. Mexico leads
in one of the five fastest growing sectors and is among
the top three producers in nine industrial sectors,
closely followed by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey.
Manufacturing value added by region
Global MVA grew at an average 3.1  percent a
year over 2002–2012, reaching $8,900  billion
(Table 10.6). The impact of the 2008–2009 crisis on
MVA was very different for industrialized and industrializing countries: whereas industrialized countries
registered an average decline of 1.0 percent annually
over 2007–2012 and have yet to recover to pre-crisis
production levels, industrializing countries did not
experience a contraction and, except for a slowdown
to 4.1 percent growth in 2009, each year after they
expanded their MVA faster than the 5.3 percent average growth of 1992–2002. The relatively high MVA
growth in industrializing countries over 2007–2012,
6.2 percent a year on average, goes hand in hand with
their good overall economic performance, as their
GDP expanded by 5.1 percent annually over the same
period.
But the manufacturing performance of individual
countries and regions was not even, reflecting their different articulation into the world economy. Although
all regions showed growth, the ratio was 6:1 between
the fastest and slowest growing regions.
East Asia and the Pacific scored the highest growth, 9.1  percent annually over 2007–2012,
mainly driven by manufacturing in China (9.9  percent growth). A powerful stimulus programme put
together by Chinese authorities in 2008 and 2009
– boosting domestic consumption and investment

178

through tax cuts, increasing government spending
in infrastructure development, increasing affordable
housing and loosening bank lending – succeeded in
compensating for the fall in external demand that
came with the global recession and in sustaining high
growth in manufacturing until 2012. Only two small
economies outperformed Chinese manufacturing
over 2007–2012: Myanmar (14.2 percent) and TimorLeste (11.2 percent).
Most of the region’s countries profited from the
dynamism of China, from widespread participation in
regional production networks and from the adoption
of stimulus packages of their own, scoring significant
industrial growth throughout the period (Viet Nam,
7.5 percent; Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 7.5 percent; Cambodia, 7.2 percent; Indonesia, 4.9 percent).
Only Samoa (–6.4 percent) and Brunei Darussalam
(–0.4  percent) recorded yearly contractions in their
MVA.
South and Central Asia registered the secondhighest growth in manufacturing over 2007–2012, at
an average annual rate of 5.6 percent, and it was the
only other region whose manufacturing production
kept growing in 2009 despite the global recession.
It benefited from proximity to China and production networks in East Asia, and from the dynamism
of Indian manufacturing, which in turn was fuelled
by strong domestic demand and a shift towards more
technologically complex products. Since 2009 India
has become the second-largest manufacturer among
industrializing countries and ranks ninth in the
world. There were no great outliers in industrial performance in the region, the countries with the fastest growing manufacturing sectors over 2007–2012
being Bhutan (7.5 percent), Afghanistan (7.4 percent),
Bangladesh (7.1  percent), India (6.7  percent), Sri
Lanka (6.6 percent) and Tajikistan (5.8 percent). Only
the Maldives (–3.0 percent) and the Islamic Republic
of Iran (–0.1 percent) showed negative results.
In the Middle East and North Africa MVA grew
by 3.5 percent over 2007–2012. The industrial performance was mixed, with the bulk of countries showing moderate growth averaging 3–5  percent a year

thanks to strong domestic demand, though most of
the growth took place only after 2009. The top performing countries were Iraq (8.6 percent) and Oman
(6.0  percent), the former gradually reconstructing
after years of war. Cyprus (–2.1 percent), Azerbaijan
(–2.0  percent), Lebanon (–1.2  percent) and Algeria
(–0.7 percent) were unable to recover to pre-crisis levels of manufacturing output.
Industrializing countries in Europe showed combined annualized MVA growth of 3  percent over
2007–2012, which would seem to indicate a remarkable recovery after the slump in 2009. There was

considerable growth in Belarus (7.6  percent) and
Poland (6.6 percent), pumped by fairly strong internal demand and a good export performance, in turn
made possible by an upgrading of the domestic production structure and a shift towards more high-tech
products (EU 2012). Whereas Albania (2.5 percent)
and Romania (1.4 percent) at least managed to recover
the ground lost during the 2008–2009 recession,
manufacturing in all other industrializing countries,
mainly in Eastern Europe or the Balkans, stagnated
or regressed drastically, emulating the general trend in
the region’s industrialized countries.

MVA growth, with Ethiopia (8.6 percent), Equatorial
Guinea (8.4 percent), Tanzania (8.2 percent), Uganda
(8.2  percent) and Nigeria (7.9  percent) showing
the highest rates. Only a few countries, including
Zimbabwe, The Gambia and the Central African
Republic, saw a decline in their manufacturing output over 2007–2012. The rather modest performance
of South Africa (0.3 percent), the region’s largest producer, accounted for the low overall growth. Amid rising domestic costs and low demand in its main export
markets, South Africa has yet to find a way to harness the potential benefits of manufacturing, which
accounts for only 13 percent of jobs and 15 percent
of GDP, figures much lower than in other emerging
countries.
Latin America and the Caribbean’s MVA
expanded the least, by 1.4 percent, which explains how
the region’s share in industrializing countries’ MVA
fell from 21 percent in 2007 to 16.6 percent in 2012.
Many countries in the region have the United States as
the major destination of their manufactured exports
and were hit hard by the crisis as they faced a sharp
fall in demand for their products. The highest MVA
growth over 2007–2012 was in Peru (5.7  percent),
Ecuador (4.8  percent) and Argentina (4.5  percent),

as these countries benefited from strong domestic
demand. Other Latin American countries had more
modest results; most Caribbean countries saw a contraction of their manufacturing output.
The industrial performance of the least developed countries over 2007–2012 was strong. Not only
did they score the highest average annual growth as
a group (6.7 percent; see Table 10.6) but many least
developed countries (Myanmar, Timor-Leste, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Cambodia, Bhutan,
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Tanzania and
Uganda) topped their regions’ MVA growth. Some of
these countries seem to be integrating with international production networks in their regions and catching up after years of isolation and domestic instability. Others are benefiting from preferential access to
industrialized countries. And all seem to be benefiting
from the growth of the Chinese market.

Chapter 11

Trends in manufactured exports

A feature of the current organization of manufacturing is the increased use of international production
networks to carry out different stages of the production process across borders, made possible by large
scales of production, advances in technology (especially micro-electronics) and affordable transport
costs.
From simple products such as garments and shoes
to complex products such as aircraft and automobiles, manufactured parts and components are likely
to be produced by numerous suppliers in different
countries, shipped around several times before finally
being incorporated into the end product. One extreme
example is the Airbus, which relies on a network of
some 1,500 suppliers in 30 countries.
The result of this production sharing has been
a larger increase in trade than the corresponding
increase in manufacturing value added (MVA). World
exports grew 6.4 percent annually between 2006 and
2011 to reach $16.7 trillion in 2011, more than 80 percent of it manufactured products (Table 11.1). In the
same period world output expanded on average by just
1.5 percent a year, as many countries were hit hard by
the economic crisis in 2008–2009.
Industrialized economies have the bulk of the
world’s manufactured exports, but industrializing
countries have been increasing their world share since
the 1990s.1

Global trends
In 2011 world manufactured exports peaked at
$13,469  billion, growing faster than manufacturing value added and GDP over 2007–2011 (see
Table 11.1). They recovered fully from the contraction
that followed the crisis, due mainly to the expansion
in exports from large industrializing countries such as
China and India. Exports of primary products grew
nearly twice as fast over the same period, often fuelled
by higher prices and strong demand from fast-growing
countries.
Manufactured exports from industrialized countries grew just 3.7 percent annually over 2007–2011,
reaching $9,483 billion in 2011, as they struggled to
recover from the dip in economic activity brought
about by the crisis (Table 11.2; see also Table 11.4).
Manufactured exports from industrializing countries
grew 10.5 percent annually over the same period, to a
peak of $3,985 billion in 2011.
The higher dynamism of industrializing economies is also reflected in the increase in their share in
world manufactured exports, from 13.9  percent in
1997 to 29.6 percent in 2011 (Figure 11.1). It was the
emerging economies that accounted for most of this
increase, their world share more than doubling from
12.3 percent in 1997 to 27.1 percent in 2011. Given
current trends and growth in network trade, it is
expected that more manufacturing activities will be

from lower production costs.
Together, the combined manufactured exports
of the largest country in each industrializing region
– China, India, Mexico, Poland, South Africa and
Turkey – accounted for 67.5 percent of the total for
industrializing countries in 2011, up from 59.9 percent in 2002 and 55.1 percent in 1997, confirming the
higher dynamism of the larger countries and a worrying widening gap with the smaller economies.
Around 60  percent of world manufactured
exports consist of medium- and high-tech products,

machinery and parts (Figure 11.2). 2 After a peak of
26 percent in 2000, the share of high-tech products
in world manufactured exports receded to 21  percent in 2011. A half-hearted investment climate in
high-income countries could be a factor behind this
weak result. While the world shares of exports of
medium- and low-tech products have been gradually
declining throughout 2000–2011, it was resourcebased products that expanded their share substantially over this period, from 17  percent to 23  percent. Worldwide, the rapid growth of manufacturing

activities in industrializing countries has translated
into a growing need for materials, while the higher
incomes and rising urban middle class in many of
these countries pushed up demand for processed food.

Advances in automation, coupled with tight quality control by production networks’ leading firms and
the upgrading of workforce skills, have made possible a
large-scale relocation of manufacturing of medium- and
high-tech products to industrializing countries, altering
the technological complexity of their exports greatly.3
Over 2006–2011 industrializing countries expanded
their share in world exports of medium- and high-tech
products by 6.2 percent annually while their share in
world exports of resource-based and low-tech products
grew at the slower rate of 2.9 percent a year. In the same
period industrialized countries saw their corresponding shares in world manufactured exports decline by
1.6 percent and 1.4 percent a year (Figure 11.3).
Of the 20 most dynamic manufactured export
products (products with the highest average annual
growth rates) over 2007–2011, 11 were resource-based
products (Table 11.3).4 Resource-endowed industrializing countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia,
Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Ukraine profited from
the fast growth that was fuelled by high demand from
the construction, metal working and food processing
industries in China and India. At the other end of the

exports were medium- and high-tech products in
industrialized countries as well as in China (and
other Asian industrializing countries such as India,
Thailand and Viet Nam). One of the major markets
for these medium- and high-tech products, besides the
traditional high-income Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development countries, is China
itself: in 2011 it received 63  percent of all optical
instrument exports.
Exports of the top four products (iron ores, vegetable fat and oils, fertilizers and office machines) grew
more than 20 percent a year on average. By total export
value, one resource-based product, petroleum oils (not
crude oil), headed the list in 2011 with $893 billion,
followed by one medium-tech item, ships, boats and
floating structures ($182 billion), and one high-tech
product, medicinal and pharmaceutical products
other than medicaments ($153 billion).
Industrializing countries’ role in world
manufactured exports
All industrializing regions have increased their share
in world manufacturing exports since 1997, but not
184

all countries and regions have fared equally well. The
surge in industrializing countries’ exports of manufactures since the turn of the century is largely attributable to China’s emergence as a large manufacturer
and exporter of many of these products. Its exports of
manufactured goods grew on average by 22.1 percent
a year over 2002–2011, twice as fast as the world’s rate
of 11.0  percent. Having become the world’s largest
exporter of manufactures in 2008, China improved its
lead further, achieving exports of $1,825 billion and a
world market share of 16.6 percent in 2011.
In line with its position as leading manufacturing region among industrializing countries, East Asia
and the Pacific accounted for the largest export share
in 2011: 56.0  percent of industrializing countries’
manufactured exports came from the region, up from
44.1  percent in 2000 (Figure 11.4). A considerable
proportion of these exports respond to intra-regional
trade, in turn driven by specialization and increased
component trade within global production networks.
But despite the resulting stronger economic integration among the region’s countries, their dependence on
the global economy remains very high, making them

particularly vulnerable to the international business
cycle (Athukorala 2011; Gangnes and van Asche 2010).
Initially, China was concentrated in manufacturing low-tech, labour-intensive assembly products,
mainly as an outsourcing option for East Asian producers exporting to the world market in the 1980s
and 1990s. Following its accession to the World Trade
Organization in 2001, China moved massively into
the production and export of more complex, mediumand high-tech manufactures with such success that
in 2011 it accounted for 81.7 percent of the region’s
exports (Figure 11.5). Of China’s top 10 export products in 2012, 6 were high-tech manufactures, totalling $446.7 billion and representing 22.8 percent of
the country’s exports. They included computer, telecommunications and office equipment; diodes and

transistors; and optical instruments. Three other were
medium-tech engineering products (UN 2013a). The
main destinations for these technologically complex
manufactures were the United States, industrialized
economies in Asia (Hong Kong SAR China, Japan,
Republic of Korea and Singapore), the European
Union (EU) and India.
The second-largest exporter of manufactured
products, Latin America and the Caribbean, could
not keep up with the fast expansion of trade in Asia
and saw its share in industrializing countries’ manufactured exports drop from 28.8 percent in 2000 to
16.0 percent in 2011. Mexico and Brazil were the major
actors, accounting for 68.2  percent of the region’s
manufactured exports in 2011, but showed two patterns of integration with international markets.

Mexico, the larger exporter of the two, is heavily
exposed to the North American market (80.7 percent
of total exports in 2012), and its exports were severely

hit by the contraction in 2008–2009. Of Mexico’s top
10 export products in 2012, two were high-tech manufactures (telecommunications and computer equipment), representing 9.6 percent of total exports, and
five were medium-tech products (passenger and goods
vehicles and their parts, TV receivers, and electrical
distribution equipment), representing 24.2 percent.
By contrast, Brazil had only one high-tech product
(aircraft, 0.2 percent of total exports) and no mediumtech products among its top 10 exports in 2012. A

only 48.0  percent of total exports. Different export
patterns gave different results too: over 2003–2011

In 2011, 48.7 percent ($6,472 billion)

of total manufactured exports was from

Manufactured exports from Sub-Saharan Africa
also grew quickly, at a 14.5  percent annual average
over 2002–2011, but this was not enough to prevent
a decline in the region’s share from 3.5  percent to
2.8 percent of industrializing countries’ manufactured
exports over the period. Besides primary products
the region was concentrated mainly in the export of
resource-based and medium-tech manufactures, primarily motor vehicles and their parts, basic chemicals,
and basic iron and steel produced in South Africa.
To appraise better a region’s export performance
in terms of strength and technological complexity,
the evolution of world market shares by technological level is examined (Figure 11.6). Over 2006–2011
East Asia and the Pacific, South and Central Asia
and Europe increased their world market shares of
resource-based and low-tech products; their shares
of medium- and high-tech products increased nearly
twice as fast. Latin America and the Caribbean’s share
of resourced-based and low-tech products stagnated
and its share of medium- and high-tech products grew
marginally. The Middle East and North Africa lost
world market share in resource-based and low-tech
manufactured exports but made considerable gains in
that of medium- and high-tech products. Sub-Saharan
Africa’s world market share of resource-based and
low-tech products grew much faster than its share of
medium- and high-tech products.

Trends in manufactured exports

2000–2011. While keeping their traditional export
markets, mostly in Eastern Europe, some countries
have shown benefits of joining the EU and succeeded
in securing new markets for their exports of manufactures. Over the last few years the downside of this
approach has been sluggish export and output growth
as Industrialized Europe struggled with the repercussions of the global economic and euro crises.
Poland accounted for 41.0 percent of the region’s
exports of manufactures in 2011, and although its
main export market is the EU (55.6 percent of total
exports), it has a fairly diversified export base concentrated in medium-tech products. Its top 10 exports in
2012 represented only 24.2 percent of the export total
and included five medium-tech manufactures (passenger and goods vehicles and their parts, TV receivers, seats, combustion engines, and ships and floating
structures), representing 14.3 percent of total exports,
and one high-tech product (computer equipment),
representing 1.7 percent.
Industrializing country shares of manufactured
exports for the Middle East and North Africa and
South and Central Asia remained below 10 percent in
2012, despite fast export growth of 15.1 percent and
19.7 percent a year, respectively. India accounted for
77 percent of South and Central Asia’s manufactured
exports in 2012 and their growth over 2002–2011 –
22.0 percent a year – was impressive, nearly matching
the expansion in China. Of India’s top 10 exports in
2012, three were medium- or high-tech manufactures
(motor vehicles, medicines and communications equipment), representing 5.7 percent of total exports; lowtech jewellery exports accounted for 6.3 percent; and
three resource-based products (non-crude petroleum
oils, diamonds and iron ores) made up 26.8 percent.
Turkey, the main exporter of manufactures in the
Middle East and North Africa with a 43.8  percent
share, also exhibited a diversified structure among its
top 10 exports: medium-tech products (motor vehicles
and their parts, and insulated cables) accounted for
10.0 percent of total exports, low-tech exports (garments and jewellery) came to 8.8 percent and resourcebased exports and gold represented 11.2 percent.

Industrializing countries’
manufactured export markets
The largest share of world manufactured exports is
mainly accounted for by trade between industrialized
countries. In 2011, 48.7  percent ($6,472  billion) of
total manufactured exports was from one industrialized country to another. By contrast, exports of manufactures among industrializing countries represented
a minor fraction of the total, 9.1 percent ($1,208 billion). But although both trade flows increased over
2006–2011, manufactured exports among industrializing countries did so at nearly 20  percent a year
(Figure 11.7). Expansion of global production networks incorporating new locations and involving

partners, but their share had been declining in favour
of exports to industrializing countries even before
the 2008–2009 crisis (Figure 11.9). The growing processed trade (import of foreign parts and components
for assembly and subsequent export as final goods)
in industrializing countries, particularly in East Asia
and the Pacific, reinforces this trend. In addition, traditional commercial ties and more familiarity with
the demand, tastes and standards of countries in the
same region help explain that they, as a group, are the
second destination of manufactured exports in all
regions but South and Central Asia, where trade with
East Asia and the Pacific is more important.

11
Trends in manufactured exports

Manufactured trade flows between the groups of
industrialized and industrializing countries accounted
together for 42.1  percent of total world exports of
manufactures and grew at comparable rates of around
11–12 percent over 2006–2011. But despite expanding their export share faster, industrializing countries
showed a trade deficit with industrialized countries
($274 billion) in 2011.
With the largest and best intertwined production networks having developed in East Asia and
the Pacific, it is this region driving the expansion in
manufactured export trade between industrializing
countries (Figure  11.8). Parts and components (for
electronic equipment and for garments or vehicles) are
produced in different countries in the region according to the level of technological complexity involved,
with final assembly usually taking place in China,
enabling participation in the network – and in international trade – by countries with varying levels of
competency and experience in international markets
(Athukorala 2011).
In all industrializing country regions, industrialized countries remain the top manufactured-export

The recovery of global manufactured
exports
World manufactured exports had grown 15.6  percent annually over 2003–2007, reaching more than
$12,120  billion in 2008, with the growth rate in
industrializing economies (23.2  percent) far greater
than that in industrialized economies (13.6 percent;
Table 11.4). After that, recession set in the United
States, the EU and Japan, affecting most industrializing countries through reduced demand for their
exports and lower migrant remittances, investment
flows, tourism income and even development aid. The
severe contraction in manufactured exports worldwide (–21.5  percent) in 2009 hit all industrializing
countries, albeit with varying force. The most stricken
regions were the Middle East and North Africa
(–26.3 percent) and Europe (–25.9 percent), as these
regions are important trading partners of the EU, but
also Sub-Saharan Africa (–23.6  percent) and Latin
America and the Caribbean (–22.3 percent).
By 2011 trade in manufactured exports had fully
recovered, setting a new record of $13,469  billion,
11 percent higher than the 2008 peak. Despite their
smaller share in manufacturing output and exports
compared with industrialized economies, it is industrializing economies that are behind the recent revival
in trade. Of the $1,349 billion additional exports in
2011 (relative to 2008), industrializing economies
accounted for $846 billion (62.7 percent), equivalent

to a growth rate of 8.3 percent a year, while industrialized economies only registered $503  billion more
manufactured exports (37.3 percent), or a growth rate
of 1.8 percent a year over 2008–2011. This is as much a
reflection of overall economic performance – because
industrialized countries are still struggling to put
their economies back on their feet while most of the
industrializing world was already up and running in
2010 – as it is a sign of the intensification of network
trade and the incorporation of more industrializing
countries into existing production networks (Hanson
2012).
Manufactured export performance of each region
was broadly in line with the performance of their
respective major countries (Figure 11.10). East Asia
and the Pacific and South and Central Asia – led
by China and India – recorded new highs in 2010
and consolidated their lead in 2011. Sub-Saharan
Africa also exceeded its prior performance in 2010,
but the main economy in the region, South Africa,
190

took longer to recover. Industrializing Europe and
Latin America and the Caribbean needed two years
to regain their grip on manufactured exports, as did
Poland and Mexico. Only the Middle East and North
Africa stood in 2011 at the same level of exports as
before the crisis.
Manufactured export growth in South and
Central Asia (averaging 18.4  percent a year over
2008–2011) was helped by a surge in exports from
India, especially from the newly established special
economic zones (SEZs; spurred by the SEZ Act 2005).
Although 19 SEZs existed previously, new rules were
put in place and 154 new SEZs became operational
after 2006. Exports of Indian SEZs boomed from a
meagre $2.5 billion in (fiscal year) 2003/04 to about
$60 billion in 2011/12 (SEZ India 2013). India contributed with $96 billion of additional manufactured
exports in 2011 (from 2008); this was similar to the
$102 billion contribution of all of Latin America and
the Caribbean but coming from a manufacturing

sector that was only 40 percent the size. The expansion of manufactured exports from the other countries in the region was also fast, as they too, like India,
intensified their ties with countries in the growing
East Asia and the Pacific region, and experienced
reductions in their exports shares to the EU and the
United States.
The upturn in East Asia and the Pacific was largely
led by China, which accounted for $455  billion of
the new manufactured exports in 2011 (from 2008).
Although China’s main export markets were still in
the mire, it seems that increased competitiveness and

lower prices may have helped in securing new exports
and even influenced decisions to relocate production
from more expensive sites in industrialized countries.
Other emerging economies in the region specialize in
key final products and in different stages of component manufacturing, supplying China or industrialized economies in the region with inputs for further
incorporation into final products.
The pace of recovery of manufactured exports
in Sub-Saharan Africa (8.0  percent annual growth
over 2008–2011), Latin America and the Caribbean
(6.0  percent), and Europe (4.2  percent) was more

moderate. The first two regions have a strong presence of resource-based manufactures, whose prices
have been on the rise due to strong demand growth in
large industrializing countries. The growth in manufactured exports in Industrializing Europe was instead
helped by the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to
the EU in 2007. Middle East and North African
countries do not enjoy tariff-free access to the EU
and have been unable to surpass their manufactured
exports peak of 2008.
The least developed countries fared fairly well
after the crisis, with manufactured exports in 2011
reaching $18  billion, up from $16  billion in 2008.
Their specialization in low-tech, affordable consumer

192

products gave them a competitive edge in the context of restrained spending in their traditional export
markets, the EU and the United States. Bangladesh,
the largest economy in the group, obtains more than
75 percent of its export earnings from the export of
knitted and woven garments and saw its exports of
these products increase steadily after the crisis. Other
least developed countries, such as Cambodia, the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, are
slowly being incorporated into their regional production networks to capitalize on their factor advantages,
while other countries have benefited from high prices
for their resource-based manufactures.
Despite progress, the least developed countries
remain fragile, as most of them concentrate on a few
products that are prone to market volatility, some of
them are torn by war or political instability, and generally they have weak infrastructure to support manufacturing exports.
Notes
1.	 See Annex 8 for a list of industrialized and industrializing countries and a classification of countries by region.
2.	 Manufactured trade can be classified by technological complexity as natural resource–based, lowtechnology and medium- and high-technology
(see Annex 4 for details).
3.	 Highly skilled manufacturing-related services,
such as design and marketing, as well as complex
manufacturing activities, are still largely performed in industrialized countries.
4.	 Geometric means are used to compute the average
growth rates.

Labour intensity

To determine the level of labour intensity, employment
per value added was estimated for 18 manufacturing
industries at two income levels of $5,000 and $20,000
GDP per capita, as the labour intensity changes along
income level. If an industry’s labour intensity is higher
than the median of 18 manufacturing industries at
both income levels, it is considered labour intensive; if
an industry’s labour intensity is lower than the median
at both income levels, it is considered relatively capital
intensive.

Labour-intensive industries (ordered from the
industry of the highest labour intensity):
•	 Wearing apparel.
•	 Textiles.
•	 Wood products.
•	 Fabricated metals.
•	 Food and beverages.
Capital-intensive industries (ordered from the
industry of the highest capital intensity):
•	 Coke and refined petroleum.
•	 Tobacco.
•	 Chemicals.
•	 Printing and publishing.
•	 Electrical machinery and apparatus.

“Structural change through the
development of manufacturing is
essential to any developing country
for job creation, poverty reduction
and sustained development.
UNIDO’s Industrial Development
Report 2013 provides careful
theoretical reviews, solid empirical
evidence and practical policy
advice for how to facilitate the
development of manufacturing in
developing countries. I strongly
recommend this report to anyone
who is interested in finding out
a path to achieve prosperity in
developing countries.”

“Structural change is the core
of sustainable development.
Continuous upgrading of
manufacturing industries offers
opportunities for growth, productive
employment and the efficient use
of resources. UNIDO’s Industrial
Development Report 2013 provides
ample evidence of how and why
structural change works and
presents sustainable paths to
industrialization. It is an extremely
valuable companion for policymakers dealing with manufacturing
upgrading and employment
generation.”

“Based on a comprehensive and
sophisticated analysis of the role of
manufacturing in structural change,
UNIDO’s Industrial Development
Report 2013 provides an insightful
discussion on the evolution and
the determinants of economic
transformation. The Report’s
findings have valuable policy
implications for both economic
practitioners and academics who
are interested in the key role that
a vibrant manufacturing sector
can play in achieving inclusive
and sustainable economic
development.”
