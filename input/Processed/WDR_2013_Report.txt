In almost every language there is a range of words related to
jobs, each emphasizing a different angle. Some words hint at
the nature of the activity being performed, evoking the skill or
expertise that is required. Others refer to the volume of human
inputs used in production, bringing images of effort and conveying a sense of physical exertion. There are also words assoArabic Mapuche
ciated with the sheer numbers of people engaged in economic
Bulgarian Malagasy
activity, which are more easily associated with aggregate staLithuanian
Indonesian/Malaysian
tistics. In other cases, what seems to be at stake is a contracKorean

tual relationship, involving mutual obligations and a degree of

stability. In some languages, there are even words to designate

at odds. Gaps probably arise from the different characteristics

of jobs being emphasized in different societies. They also sugGalician
gest that jobs’ agendas can differ across countries.
In many languages, words related to jobs serve not only as
common nouns but also as proper nouns. Throughout history family names have been associated with specific skills or
trades: Vankar in Hindi, Hattori in Japanese, Herrero in Spanish, or Mfundisi in Zulu, just to mention a few. The use of
job-related words as household identifiers shows that people
associated themselves with what they did. Nowadays, people aspire to choose their jobs based
on what motivates them and on what could make their lives more meaningful. In almost every
language there are also several words to express the lack of a job. Almost invariably these words
have a negative connotation, close in spirit to deprivation; at times they even carry an element
of stigma. In all these ways, language conveys the idea that jobs are more than what people
earn, or what they do at work: they are also part of who they are.

Foreword

Today, jobs are a critical concern across the globe—for policy makers, the business community,
and the billions of men and women striving to provide for their families.
As the world struggles to emerge from the global crisis, some 200 million people—including 75 million under the age of 25—are unemployed. Many millions more, most of them
women, find themselves shut out of the labor force altogether. Looking forward, over the next
15 years an additional 600 million new jobs will be needed to absorb burgeoning working-age
populations, mainly in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Meanwhile, almost half of all workers in developing countries are engaged in small-scale
farming or self-employment, jobs that typically do not come with a steady paycheck and benefits. The problem for most poor people in these countries is not the lack of a job or too few
hours of work; many hold more than one job and work long hours. Yet, too often, they are not
earning enough to secure a better future for themselves and their children, and at times they
are working in unsafe conditions and without the protection of their basic rights.
Jobs are instrumental to achieving economic and social development. Beyond their critical
importance for individual well-being, they lie at the heart of many broader societal objectives, such as poverty reduction, economy-wide productivity growth, and social cohesion. The
development payoffs from jobs include acquiring skills, empowering women, and stabilizing
post-conflict societies. Jobs that contribute to these broader goals are valuable not only for
those who hold them but for society as a whole: they are good jobs for development.
The World Development Report 2013 takes the centrality of jobs in the development process as its starting point and challenges and reframes how we think about work. Adopting a
cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach, the Report looks at why some jobs do more for
development than others. The Report finds that the jobs with the greatest development payoffs
are those that make cities function better, connect the economy to global markets, protect the
environment, foster trust and civic engagement, or reduce poverty. Critically, these jobs are not
only found in the formal sector; depending on the country context, informal jobs can also be
transformational.
Building on this framework, the Report tackles some of the most pressing questions policy
makers are asking right now: Should countries design their development strategies around
growth or focus on jobs? Are there situations where the focus should be on protecting jobs
as opposed to protecting workers? Which needs to come first in the development process—
creating jobs or building skills?
The private sector is the key engine of job creation, accounting for 90 percent of all jobs in
the developing world. But governments play a vital role by ensuring that the conditions are in
place for strong private sector–led growth and by alleviating the constraints that hinder the
private sector from creating good jobs for development.
The Report advances a three-stage approach to help governments meet these objectives.
First, policy fundamentals—including macroeconomic stability, an enabling business environment, investments in human capital, and the rule of law—are essential for both growth and
job creation. Second, well-designed labor policies can help ensure that growth translates into
employment opportunities, but they need to be complemented by a broader approach to job
creation that looks beyond the labor market. Third, governments should strategically identify

which jobs would do the most for development given their specific country context, and remove or offset the obstacles that prevent the private sector from creating more of those jobs.
In today’s global economy, the world of work is rapidly evolving. Demographic shifts, technological progress, and the lasting effects of the international financial crisis are reshaping the
employment landscape in countries around the world. Countries that successfully adapt to
these changes and meet their jobs challenges can achieve dramatic gains in living standards,
productivity growth, and more cohesive societies. Those that do not will miss out on the transformational effects of economic and social development.
The World Development Report 2013 is an important contribution to our collective understanding of the role of jobs in development. Its insights will provide valuable guidance for the
World Bank Group as we collaborate with partners and clients to advance their jobs agendas.
Working together, we can foster job creation and maximize the development impact of jobs.

Data Notes
The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World Bank
about the legal or other status of territory. The term developing countries includes low- and
middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from central planning, as a matter of convenience. Dollar figures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise
specified. Billion means 1,000 million; trillion means 1,000 billion.

overview

Moving jobs center stage

J

obs are the cornerstone of economic and
­social development. Indeed, development
happens through jobs. People work their
way out of poverty and hardship through better livelihoods. Economies grow as people get
better at what they do, as they move from farms
to firms, and as more productive jobs are created and less productive ones disappear. Societies flourish as jobs bring together people
from different ethnic and social backgrounds
and nurture a sense of opportunity. Jobs are
thus transformational—they can transform
what we earn, what we do, and even who we
are.
No surprise, then, that jobs are atop the
development agenda everywhere—for everyone from policy makers to the populace, from
business leaders to union representatives, from
activists to academics. Looking to seize opportunities for job creation presented by massive
demographic shifts, technological innovations,
global migrations of people and tasks, and deep
changes in the nature of work, policy makers ask
difficult questions:

• Should

countries build their development
strategies around growth or should they
rather focus on jobs?

• Can entrepreneurship be fostered, especially

among the many microenterprises in developing countries, or are entrepreneurs born?

• While jobs can contribute to social cohesion,
is there anything governments can do about
it, apart from trying to support job creation?

• Are

greater investments in education and
training a prerequisite for employability, or
can skills be built through jobs?

• Should efforts to improve the investment cli-

mate target the areas, activities, or firms with
greater potential for job creation?

• What

is the risk that policies to foster job
creation in one country will come at the expense of jobs in other countries?

• When confronted with large shocks and ma-

jor restructuring, is it advisable to protect jobs
and not just people?

• How can the reallocation of workers be accelerated from areas and activities with low
productivity to those with greater potential?

Individuals value jobs for the earnings and
benefits they provide, as well as for their contributions to self-esteem and happiness. But some
jobs have broader impacts on society. Jobs for
women can change the way households spend
money and invest in the education and health
of children. Jobs in cities support greater specialization and the exchange of ideas, making
other jobs more productive. Jobs connected
to global markets bring home new technologi-

	

Moving jobs center stage   

cal and managerial knowledge. And in turbulent
environments, jobs for young men can provide
alternatives to violence and help restore peace.
Through their broader influence on living
standards, productivity, and social cohesion,
these jobs have an even greater value to society
than they do for the individual. But some jobs
can have negative spillovers. Jobs supported
through transfers or privilege represent a burden to others or undermine their opportunities
to find remunerative employment. Jobs damaging the environment take a toll on everybody.
Thus it is that some jobs do more for development, while others may do little, even if they are
appealing to individuals.
Which jobs have the greatest development payoffs depends on the circumstances.
Countries differ in their level of development,
demography, endowments, and institutions.
Agrarian socie­ties face the challenge of making
agricultural jobs more productive and creating job opportunities outside farms. Resourcerich countries need to diversify their exports,
so that jobs are connected to global markets
rather than supported through government
transfers. Formalizing countries need to design their social protection systems in ways
that extend their coverage without penalizing
employment.
A vast majority of jobs are created by the
private sector. Governments, though, can support—or hinder—the private sector in creating jobs. The idea that development happens
through jobs sheds new light on the strategies,
policies, and programs governments can pursue. Strategies should identify which types of
jobs would have the highest development payoffs, given a country’s circumstances. Policies
should remove the obstacles that prevent the
private sector from creating jobs. Programs for
generating employment may also be warranted,
for instance, in conflict-affected countries. But
the costs and benefits of these policies and programs have to be assessed, taking into account
the potential spillovers from jobs, both positive
and negative.
At a more practical level, this jobs lens on
devel­opment leads to a three-layered policy
approach:

• Fundamentals.

Because jobs provide higher
earnings and broader social benefits as coun-

tries grow richer, the policy environment
must be conducive to growth. That requires
attending to macroeconomic stability, an enabling business environment, human capital
accumulation, and the rule of law.

• Labor policies. Because growth alone may not

be enough, labor policies need to facilitate
job creation and enhance the development
payoffs from jobs. Policies can address labor
market distortions while not being a drag on
efficiency. But they should avoid distortionary interventions that constrain employment in cities and global value chains—and
provide voice and protection for the most
vulnerable.

• Priorities.

Because some jobs do more for
development than others, it is necessary to
identify the types of jobs with the greatest
development payoffs given a country’s context, and to remove—or at least offset—the
market imperfections and institutional failures that result in too few of those jobs being
created.

The centrality of jobs for development
should not be interpreted as the centrality of
labor policies and institutions. Nearly half
the people at work in developing countries
are farmers or self-employed and so are outside the labor market. And even in the case of
wage employment, labor policies and institutions may or may not be the main obstacle to
job creation. Often, the most relevant obstacles
lie outside of the labor market. The catalysts
for job creation may be policies that make cities work better, help farmers access and apply
appropriate agricultural techniques, or allow
firms to develop new exports. Jobs are the cornerstone of development, and development
policies are needed for jobs.

Jobs wanted
To many, a “job” brings to mind a worker with
an employer and a regular paycheck. Yet, the
majority of workers in the poorest countries
are outside the scope of an employer-employee
relationship. Worldwide, more than 3 billion
people are working, but their jobs vary greatly.
Some 1.65 billion are employed and receive reg-

ular wages or salaries. Another 1.5 billion work
in farming and small household enterprises, or
in casual or seasonal day labor. Meanwhile, 200
million people, a disproportionate share of them
youth, are unemployed and actively looking for
work. Almost 2 billion working-age adults, the
majority of them women, are neither working
nor looking for work, but an unknown number
of them are eager to have a job. Clarifying what
is meant by a job is thus a useful starting point.
The meaning of the words used to describe what people do to earn a living varies
across countries and cultures. Some words refer to workers in offices or factories. Others are
broader, encompassing farmers, self-employed
vendors in cities, and caregivers of children and
the elderly. The distinction is not merely semantic. The varied meanings hint at the different
aspects of jobs that people value. And views on
what a job is almost inevitably influence views
on what policies for jobs should look like.
For statisticians, a job is “a set of tasks and
duties performed, or meant to be performed,
by one person, including for an employer or
in self-employment.”1 Jobs are performed by
the employed. These are defined as people who
produce goods and services for the market or
for their own use. But the statistical definition
is mute about what should not be considered
a job. International norms view basic human

rights as the boundaries of what is unacceptable.
Among them are the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the
International Labour Organization Declaration
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work
(1998), which further specifies core labor standards. Combining these different perspectives,
jobs are activities that generate income, monetary or in kind, without violating human rights.

Different places, different jobs
The world of work is particularly diverse in developing countries. This variety refers not only
to the number of hours worked and the number
of jobs available, the usual yardsticks in industrial countries, but also to the characteristics of
jobs. Two main aspects stand out. One is the
prevalence of self-employment and farming.2
The other is the coexistence of traditional and
modern modes of production, from subsistence
agriculture and low-skilled work to technologydriven manufacturing and services and highly
skilled knowledge work.
While nearly half of the jobs in the developing
world are outside the labor market, the shares of
wage work, farming, and self-­employment differ
greatly across countries.3 Nonwage work represents more than 80 percent of women’s employment in Sub-Saharan ­Africa—but less than

for both men and women in Tanzania and Vietnam. Beyond these stark contrasts in participation, women continue to earn significantly less
than men, and the differences are not fully explained by education, experience, or sector of
work. While a growing share of youth between
ages 15 and 24 allocate most of their time to
schooling and training, youth unemployment is
still alarming in some countries (above 40 percent in South Africa since early 2008 and above
50 percent in Spain in early 2012).5 Even in
countries where it is low, youth unemployment
is twice the national average or more. In addition, 621 million young people are “idle”—not
in school or training, not employed, and not
looking for work. Rates of idleness vary across
countries, ranging between 10 and 50 percent
among 15- to 24-year-olds (figure 2).6 Many
youth work in unpaid jobs; if paid, they are less
likely to have social insurance.7

20 percent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
(figure 1).
Work across the developing world is also
characterized by a high prevalence of informality, whether defined on the basis of lack of firm
registration, lack of social security coverage, or
lack of an employment contract. Informal employment is not under the purview of labor regulations, either because of their limited scope or
because of deliberate avoidance or evasion. Regardless of the specific definition used, informality is generally associated with lower productivity. However, this does not necessarily mean that
formalization would result in greater efficiency.
Informality can be a symptom of lower productivity as much as it can be a cause of it.4
Gender and age differences are striking.
Worldwide, fewer than half of women have jobs,
compared with almost four-fifths of men. In
Pakistan, 28 percent of women but more than
82 percent of men participate in the labor force,
whereas participation rates are above 75 percent

This complex picture is compounded by massive demographic shifts. To keep employment
as a share of the working-age population constant, in 2020 there should be around 600 million more jobs than in 2005, a majority of them
in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. While some
countries have experienced very large increases
in their labor force—nearly 8 million new entrants a year in China since the mid-1990s and 7
million in India—others face a shrinking population. Ukraine’s labor force, for example, is estimated to fall by about 160,000 people a year.8
Rapid urbanization is changing the composition of employment. More than half the
population in developing countries is expected
to be living in cities and towns before 2020.9
As a result, the growth of the nonagricultural
labor force will vastly exceed the growth of the
agricultural labor force. This structural change,
which in industrial countries took decades, now
transforms lives in developing countries in a
generation. Structural change can bring about
remarkable improvements in efficiency, and
some developing countries have narrowed the
productivity gap with industrial countries rapidly. But others have failed to catch up.10 Overall, the gap between developing and developed
regions remains wide.
Globalization is also changing the nature
of jobs. Industrial countries are shifting from

	

primary and traditional manufacturing industries toward services and knowledge-intensive
activities.11 At the same time, technological
improvements and outsourcing to developing
countries are leading to a decline in mediumskilled jobs.12 Production tasks have been splintered so that they can be performed in different
locations.13 Transnational companies have built
integrated value chains to tap into national skill
pools around the world.14 Outsourcing is occurring in services as well as in manufacturing.
The share of developing countries in exports of
world services nearly doubled to 21 percent between 1990 and 2008.15
Technology is changing the way workers and
firms connect, through their access to much
larger, even global, employment marketplaces.
Some of the new marketplaces operate through
the internet; others use mobile phone technology.16 Part-time and temporary wage employment are now major features of industrial and
developing countries. In South Africa, temporary agency workers make up about 7 percent of
the labor force; the temporary staffing industry
provides employment to an average of 410,000
workers a day. In India, the number of temporary workers that employment agencies recruit
grew more than 10 percent in 2009 and 18 percent in 2010.17
This changing landscape of global production has also brought about shifts in skill endowments and in the world distribution of top
talent. China and India rank high in perceived
attractiveness as outsourcing hubs because of
their exceptionally high ratings in the availability of skills.18 India has close to 20 million
students in higher education, nearly as many as
the United States; both countries are outpaced
by China, with 30 million postsecondary students.19 The United States still accounts for a
large share of top scores in international student
assessments, but the Republic of Korea has the
same share as Germany, and both are closely followed by the Russian Federation. The number
of high-performing students in Shanghai alone
is one-fifth that of Germany and about twice
that of Argentina.20

The role of the private sector
In such rapidly changing times, the private sector is the main engine of job creation and the
source of almost 9 of every 10 jobs in the world.

Moving jobs center stage   

Between 1995 and 2005, the private sector accounted for 90 percent of jobs created in Brazil, and for 95 percent in the Philippines and
Turkey.21 The most remarkable example of the
­expansion of employment through private sector growth is China. In 1981, private sector employment accounted for 2.3 million workers,
while state-owned enterprises (SOEs) had 80
million workers.22 Twenty years later, the private
sector accounted for 74.7 million workers, surpassing, for the first time, the 74.6 million workers in SOEs (figure 3).
In contrast to the global average, in some
countries in the Middle East and North Africa,
the state is a leading employer, a pattern that can
be linked to the political economy of the postindependence period, and in some cases to the
abundance of oil revenues.23 For a long period,
public sector jobs were offered to young college
graduates. But as the fiscal space for continued
expansion in public sector employment shrank,
“queuing” for public sector jobs became more
prevalent, leading to informality, a devaluation
of educational credentials, and forms of social
exclusion.24 A fairly well-educated and young
labor force remains unemployed, or underemployed, and labor productivity stagnates.25
Overall, countries have been successful at
creating jobs. More people have jobs now than
ever before, and those jobs provide generally
higher earnings. Indeed, amid rapid social and
economic change, poverty has declined in developing countries. The share of the population of the developing world living on less than
US$1.25 a day (in purchasing power parity) fell
from 52 percent in 1981 to 22 percent in 2008,
or from 1.94 billion people to 1.29 billion.26
This reduction is the result of multiple factors,
but the creation of millions of new, more productive jobs, mostly in Asia but also in other
parts of the developing world, has been the
main driving force.27
Jobs are vulnerable to economic downturns,
though, much more so in the private sector than
the public sector. Short-term crises may wipe
out years of progress. They may start in a single
country but now, through globalization, spread
over entire regions or to the world. The recent
financial crisis created 22 million new unemployed in a single year. Growth in total employment, hovering around 1.8 percent a year before
2008, fell to less than 0.5 percent in 2009, and
by 2011 had not yet reached its pre-crisis level.28

Demography, urbanization, globalization,
technology, and macroeconomic crises bring
about formidable jobs challenges. Countries
that fail to address them may fall into vicious
circles of slow growth in labor earnings and
job-related dissatisfaction affecting a sizable
portion of the labor force.30 Youth unemployment and idleness may be high, and women
may have fewer job opportunities, leaving potential economic and social gains untapped.31
A repeating pattern of small gains in living
standards, slow productivity growth, and eroding social cohesion can set in. In contrast,
countries that address these jobs challenges can
develop virtuous circles. The results—prosperous populations, a growing middle class,
increased productivity, and improved opportunities for women and youth—may then be
self-reinforcing.

Development happens through jobs

JOBS

Jobs are more than just the earnings and benefits
they provide. They are also the output they generate, and part of who we are and how we interact
with others in society. Through these outcomes,

jobs can boost living standards, raise productivity, and foster social cohesion (figure 4).

Jobs are what we earn
Jobs are the most important determinant of
living standards. For most people, work is the
main source of income, especially in the poorest
countries. Many families escape or fall into poverty because family members get or lose a job.
Opportunities for gainful work, including in
farming and self-employment, offer households
the means to increase consumption and reduce
its variability. Higher yields in agriculture, access to small off-farm activities, the migration
of family members to cities, and transitions to
wage employment are milestones on the path to
prosperity.32 And as earnings increase, individual choices expand—household members can
choose to stay out of the labor force or to work
fewer hours and dedicate more time to education, to retirement, or to family.
Earnings from work increase with economic
development, and the benefits associated with
jobs improve as well. The relationship is not
mechanical, but growth is clearly good for jobs
(figure 5). Admittedly, as economies become
more developed, the average skills of jobholders increase, implying that observations across
countries are not strictly comparable, as they do

Jobs

not refer to identical workers. But growth also
improves the living standards of workers whose
skills have not changed.
More than two decades of research on poverty dynamics, spanning countries as different
as Canada, Ecuador, Germany, and South Africa,
show that labor-related events trigger exits from
poverty.33 These events range from the head of
a household changing jobs to family members
starting to work and to working family members earning more. Conversely, a lack of job opportunities reduces the ability of households
to improve their well-being.34 In a large set of
qualitative studies in low-income countries, getting jobs and starting businesses were two of the
main reasons for people to rise out of poverty.35
Quantitative analysis confirms that changes
in labor earnings are the largest contributor to
poverty reduction (figure 6). In 10 of 18 Latin
American countries, changes in labor income
explain more than half the reduction in poverty,
and in another 5 countries, more than a third. In
Bangladesh, Peru, and Thailand, changes in education, work experience, and region of residence
mattered, but the returns to these characteristics
(including labor earnings) mattered most. Just
having work was not enough, given that most
people work in less developed economies. What
made a difference for escaping poverty was increasing the earnings from work.36

Note: Family composition indicates the change in the share of adults (ages 18 and older) within the household. Labor income refers to the change in employment and earnings for
each adult. Nonlabor income refers to changes in other sources of income such as transfers, pensions, and imputed housing rents. If a bar is located below the horizontal axis, it
means that that source would have increased, instead of decreased, poverty. The changes are computed for Argentina (2000–10); Bangladesh (2000–10); Brazil (2001–09); Chile
(2000–09); Colombia (2002–10); Costa Rica (2000–08); Ecuador (2003–10); El Salvador (2000-09); Ghana (1998–2005); Honduras (1999–2009); Mexico (2000–10); Moldova (2001–10);
Panama (2001–09); Paraguay (1999–2010); Peru (2002–10); Nepal (1996–2003); Romania (2001–09); and Thailand (2000–09). The changes for Bangladesh, Ghana, Moldova, Nepal,
Peru, Romania, and Thailand are computed using consumption-based measures of poverty, while the changes for the other countries are based on income measures.

Beyond their fundamental and immediate
contribution to earnings, jobs also affect other
dimensions of well-being, including mental and
physical health. Not having a job undermines
life satisfaction, especially in countries where
wage employment is the norm and where the
lack of opportunities translates into open unemployment rather than underemployment.
Among those employed, the material, nonmaterial, and even subjective characteristics of jobs
can all have an impact on well-being.37 Other
features such as workplace safety, job security,
learning and advancement opportunities, and
health and social protection benefits are valued
by workers. But relatively few jobs offer these
advantages in developing countries.

Jobs are what we do
Economic growth happens as jobs become more
productive, but also as more productive jobs

are created and less productive jobs disappear.
These gains may ultimately be driven by new
goods, new methods of production and transportation, and new markets, but they materialize through a constant restructuring and reallocation of resources, including labor.38 Net job
creation figures hide much larger processes of
gross job creation and gross job destruction. On
average across developing countries, between
7 and 20 percent of jobs in manufacturing are
created within a year, but a similar proportion
disappear (figure 7).39
Because economies grow as high-productivity
jobs are created and low-productivity jobs disappear, the relationship between productivity
gains and job creation is not mechanical. In the
medium term, employment trends align closely
with trends in the size of the labor force, so
growth is truly jobless in very few cases. In the
short term, however, innovations can be associated with either increases or decreases in em-

	

ployment.40 The popular perception is that productivity grows through downsizing, but some
firms are able to achieve both productivity and
employment gains.41 In Chile, Ethiopia, and
Romania, successful “upsizers” contributed to
output and employment growth substantively;
sometimes they are more numerous than the
successful “down­­sizers.”42 And the combination
of private sector vibrancy and state sector restructuring led to rapid output and employment growth in transition economies and in
China in the late 1990s and the early 2000s.43
Successful upsizers tend to be younger,
leaner, and more innovative.44 But overall, large
firms are both more innovative and more productive. They invest more in machinery. They
are much more likely than small firms to develop new product lines, to introduce new technology, to open and close plants, to outsource,
and to engage in joint ventures with foreign
partners.45 These firms produce more with a
given amount of labor, and export more as well.
They also pay substantively higher wages than
micro- and small enterprises (figure 8). In developing countries, however, many people work
in very small and not necessarily very dynamic
economic units.
Family farms dominate in agriculture. At 1.8
and 1.2 hectares, respectively, average farm size
is small in Sub-Saharan Africa, and especially
in Asia.46 The Green Revolution has led to both
higher cereal yields and more job creation because the new technologies are labor intensive.
But progress has been uneven across regions
and has not taken place on a large scale in SubSaharan Africa. More mechanized farms have
higher productivity, but constraints in land
markets usually slow mechanization; without it,
yields per hectare tend to be higher on smaller
farms.
Outside agriculture there are massive
numbers of microenterprises and household
­
businesses (figure 9). These small units play
significant roles in job creation, even in highmiddle-income countries. They account for 97
percent of employment in the manufacturing
sector in Ethiopia, but still for a sizable 39 percent in Chile. In the services sector, their role is
often more important. Even in Eastern European
countries, where the private sector is only two
decades old, microenterprises are the source of
10 to 20 percent of employment in manufactur-

ing and 30 to 50 percent of employment in services. The large numbers of economic units are
associated with a very wide dispersion of total
factor productivity. In India, even within narrowly defined sectors, a manufacturing plant
at the 10th percentile of the distribution generates 22 times less output than a plant in the 90th
percentile would produce with the same inputs.
This pattern is similar in a number of Latin
American countries. By comparison, the ratio is
1 to 9 in the United States.47
While microenterprises have lackluster performance as a group, they are also very diverse.
Microenterprises and household businesses are a
means of survival for the poor and a way of diversifying out of farming activities. On ­average,
their owners do not earn much.48 But in middleincome countries, many among the owners of
micro- and small enterprises are as entrepreneurial as their peers in industrial countries. Their
weak performance may be due to an adverse
investment environment—for example, limited
access to credit.49 Yet a small number of micro-

enterprises, the gazelles, invest and earn higher
returns.50
While large firms are more productive, they
were not all born large. In industrial countries,
some of the more resounding successes, from
Honda to Microsoft, started in garages. Many
successful companies in developing countries
also grew out of small household businesses.
Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group, founded
in 1921 as a small seed shop in Bangkok by two
brothers, has grown into one of the largest multi­
national conglomerates in agribusiness, operating in 15 countries and encompassing close to
100 companies. India’s Tata Group transformed
from a Mumbai-based family-owned trading
firm in the late 19th century to a multinational
conglomerate, comprising 114 companies and
subsidiaries across eight business sectors on
several continents. Many of China’s success­
ful clusters, such as the footwear industry in
­Wenzhou, also started from small family businesses working close to each other.51
Unfortunately, in many developing countries, larger and older firms tend to be stagnant
while smaller and younger enterprises are prone
to churning. A vibrant dynamic process is usually absent. In Ghana, many firms were born
large and showed little growth over 15 years; in
Portugal, by contrast, many firms born as microenterprises grew substantially.52 The majority of firms in India is also born small, but they
tend to stay small, without displaying much
variation in employment over their life cycle.
A revealing comparison involves the size of
35-year old firms relative to their size at birth.
In India, the size declines by a fourth; in Mexico, it doubles. In the United States, it becomes
10 times bigger.53 The potential gains from
greater entrepreneurial vibrancy, and from a
more substantial reallocation of labor from
low- to high-productivity units, are sizable.54
But helping those gains materialize is a daunting task.

Jobs are who we are
Having, or not having, a job can shape how people view themselves and relate to others. While
some jobs can be empowering, in extreme cases
a lack of job opportunities can contribute to violence or social unrest. Youth may turn to gangs
to compensate for the absence of identity and
belonging that a job might provide. In Ecua-

dor, for instance, they did so “because they were
searching for the support, trust, and cohesion—
social capital—that they maintained their families did not provide, as well as because of the lack
of opportunities in the local context.”55
The workplace can be a place to encounter
new ideas and interact with people of different
genders or ethnicities. Bosnians interviewed
in the late 1990s commented that “the area in
which there is the greatest support for ethnic cooperation is in the workplace.”56 Business people
in Trinidad and Tobago reported that they interacted with people of a wider range of ethnicities at work than they did in their social lives.57
Networks can also exclude. In Morocco, people

whose fathers did not have formal sector jobs
were significantly less likely to have such jobs
themselves.58
The distribution of jobs within society—and
perceptions about who has access to opportunities and why—can shape expectations for the
future and perceptions of fairness. Children’s
aspirations may be influenced by whether their
parents have jobs and the types of jobs they
have. The Arab Spring was not merely about
employment. But disappointment, especially
among youth, about the lack of job opportunities and frustration with the allocation of jobs
based on connections rather than merit echoed
across countries.

Note: The vertical axis shows the probability of the respondent being an active member of one or more of nine types of associations, controlling for the income, education,
and demographic characteristics of respondents. In panel a, the probability is linked to being unemployed, and panel b to having a job characterized as cognitive, creative, or
independent. The vertical lines indicate the 95 percent confidence interval of the estimated probability.

Jobs influence how people view themselves,
how they interact with others, and how they
perceive their stake in society.59 Jobs also can
have collective consequences. They can shape
how societies handle collective decision making,
manage tensions between diverse groups, and
avoid and resolve conflicts. The relationship is
not immediate or direct, however. Jobs are only
one factor contributing to the capacity of societies to manage collective decision making peacefully. And social cohesion can in turn influence
jobs by shaping the context in which entrepreneurs make business decisions.
Trust beyond one’s own group and civic engagement are two indicators of social cohesion.
Unemployment and job loss are associated with
lower levels of both trust and civic engagement
(figure 10). While causality is difficult to establish, there is more than just a correlation at
stake. Indonesian men and women who were
working in 2000 but not in 2007 were less likely
to be participating in community activities than
those still at work. And those who were working
in 2007 but not in 2000 were significantly more
likely to be involved in the community than
those who were still out of work.60

The nature of jobs matters as well. Jobs that
empower, build agency, and respect rights are
associated with greater trust and willingness to
participate in civil society. Jobs that create economic and social ties may build incentives to
work across boundaries and resolve conflict.
And if people believe that job opportunities are
available to them either now or in the future,
their trust in others and their confidence in institutions may increase. Ultimately, jobs can influence social cohesion through their effects on
social identity, networks, and fairness.

Valuing jobs
Not all forms of work are acceptable. Activities
that exploit workers, expose them to dangerous
environments, or threaten their physical and
mental well-being are bad for individuals and
societies alike. Child prostitution and forced labor contravene principles of human dignity and
undermine individual and collective well-being.
Today, an estimated 21 million people globally
are victims of bonded labor, slavery, forced prostitution, and other forms of involuntary work.61

	

In 2008, 115 million children between the ages
of 5 and 17 were involved in hazardous work.62
International norms of human rights and labor
standards reject forced labor, harmful forms of
child labor, discrimination, and the suppression
of voice among workers.
Beyond rights, the most obvious outcome
of a job is the earnings it provides to its holder.
These earnings can be in cash or in kind and
may include a range of associated benefits.
Other characteristics, such as stability, voice,
and fulfillment at work, also affect subjective
well-being. Several of these dimensions of jobs
have been combined into the concept of Decent Work, introduced by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1999.63 Defined as
“opportunities for women and men to obtain
decent and productive work in conditions of
freedom, equity, security and human dignity,”
this concept has been used by many governments to articulate their policy agendas on
jobs. The concept of Decent Work has also been
embraced by the United Nations and several
international organizations and endorsed by
numerous global forums.
As jobs provide earnings, generate output,
and influence identity, they shape the wellbeing of those who hold them—and they also
affect the well-being of others. To understand
how much jobs contribute to development, it is
necessary to assess these effects—the spillovers
from jobs. Jobs that generate positive spillovers
have a greater value to society than they have
to the individual who holds the job, while the
opposite is true when spillovers are negative. Intuitively, many people have notions about such
broader payoffs. When asked about their most
preferred jobs, respondents in China, Colombia,
Egypt, and Sierra Leone give different answers
from those they offer when asked to identify
the most important jobs to society (figure 11).
Working as a civil servant or as a shop owner is
generally preferred by individuals, while teachers and doctors are quite often mentioned as the
most important jobs for society.
Who gets a job makes a difference too, and
not just for individuals. In a society that values
poverty reduction, jobs that take households
out of hardship generate a positive spillover,
because they improve the well-being of those
who care. Female employment also matters beyond the individual. An increase in the share of

Moving jobs center stage   

household income contributed by women often results in improvements in children’s educational attainment and health. In Bangladesh,
where the garment industry employs women
in large numbers, the opening of a garment
factory within commuting distance of a village is seen as a signal of opportunity and leads
to increased schooling for girls.64 Among dis­
advantaged castes in Southern Indian villages,
an increase of US$90 in a woman’s annual income is estimated to increase schooling among
her children by 1.6 years.65
Similarly, a job created or sustained through
foreign direct investment (FDI) matters for
other jobs, and thus for other people. With the
investment come knowledge and know-how.
These raise productivity not only in the foreign
subsidiary but also among local firms interacting with the subsidiary or operating in its vicinity. Such knowledge spillovers are sizable in lowand middle-income countries.66 Conversely, a
job in a protected industry that needs to be supported through transfers (either by taxpayers
or by consumers) generates a negative spillover,
even more so when the need for protection is
associated with the use of outdated technology
that results in high environmental costs.
Jobs can also affect other people by shaping
social values and norms, influencing how groups
coexist and manage tensions. In Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia, surveys found that the number of
people willing to work together or do business
with someone of a different ethnicity was greater
than the number of people in favor of interethnic cooperation in schools or neighborhoods.67
And in the Dominican Republic, a program targeted to youth at risk shows that jobs can change
behaviors with positive implications for society.
Participation in the Programa Juventud y Empleo (Youth and Employment Program), which
provides a combination of vocational and life
skills training, reduced involvement in gangs,
violence, and other risky behaviors.68
For the same level of earnings and benefits,
the larger the positive spillovers from a job, the
more transformational the job can be, and the
greater its value to society. In everyday parlance,
good jobs are those that provide greater wellbeing to the people who hold them. But good
jobs for development are those with the highest
value for society. Understanding these wider

pay­offs to jobs has shaped recent development
thinking.69
Spillovers from jobs can be identified across
all three transformations (figure 12). Some directly affect the earnings of others, as when a job
is supported through government transfers, or
restrictive regulations that reduce employment
opportunities for others. Other spillovers take
place through interactions: in households in the
case of gender equality, at the workplace when
knowledge and ideas are shared, or in society
more broadly in the case of networks. Spillovers
also occur when jobs and their allocation con-

tribute to common goals, such as poverty reduction, environmental protection, or fairness.
Because a job can affect the well-being of
others as well as that of the jobholder, two jobs
that may appear identical from an individual
perspective could be different from a social perspective (figure 13). The individual perspective
provides a useful starting point, because it often
coincides with the social perspective. A highpaying job in Bangalore’s information technology sector is probably good for the worker; it is
also good for India because it contributes to the

two perspectives may conflict. For instance, Vietnam’s poverty rate declined with unprecedented
speed in the 1990s when land was redistributed
to farmers and agricultural commercialization
was liberalized.70 From the individual perspective, farming jobs involve difficult working conditions, substantial variability in earnings, and
no formal social protection. But they can make
a major contribution to development, as a ticket
out of poverty for many. Conversely, bloated
public utilities often offer a range of privileges to
their employees even if the utilities themselves
provide only limited coverage and unreliable
services and are obstacles to economic growth
and poverty reduction. Such jobs may look appealing from an individual perspective, but are
less so to society.

Creating more jobs may be a universal goal, but
the types of jobs that can contribute the most
to development depend on the country context.

But the nature of good jobs for development
in a particular context is not simply a function
of income per capita. It may be influenced by
conflict that is ongoing or still reverberating.
A country’s geography or its natural endowments can also be determining factors. Small island nations have unique jobs challenges, as do
resource-rich economies. Or demography may
be the key characteristic—witness the imposing
but very different challenges in countries facing
high youth unemployment and those with aging populations.

A typology of jobs challenges
A country’s level of development, institutional
strength, endowments, and demography define where the development payoff from jobs
is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will
thus be different from that in another country,
depending on their dominant features. The
challenges facing countries as they move along
the development path are illustrated by the
agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases:

• Agrarian countries. Most people are still en-

gaged in agriculture and live in rural areas.
Jobs that improve living standards have a
substantial development payoff because of
high poverty rates. Cities need to be more
functional to reap the benefits from agglomeration and global integration, so jobs that
set the foundation for cities to eventually become economically dynamic are good jobs
for development. Even in the most optimistic
scenario, however, it may take decades before
urbanization is complete, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority.

• Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in

agriculture has risen enough to free up large
numbers of people to work in cities. Job
opportunities for women, typically in light
manufacturing, can have positive impacts
on the household allocation of resources.
Jobs that deepen the global integration of
urbanizing countries, especially in highervalue-added export sectors, are also good
for development. As countries urbanize,
congestion, pollution, and other costs of
high density become increasingly serious, so

jobs that do no environmental damage have
particularly positive development impacts.

• Formalizing countries. Large and growing ur-

ban populations generally lead to more developed economies, where a fairly substantial
proportion of firms and workers are covered
by formal institutions and social programs.
But further increasing formality to levels typical of industrial countries involves tradeoffs
between living standards, productivity, and
social cohesion. There is a premium on jobs
that can be formalized without making labor
too costly and on jobs that reduce the divide
between those who benefit from formal institutions and those who do not.

In some countries, the jobs challenge is
shaped by demography and special circumstances affecting particular groups.

•  In countries with high youth unemployment

young people do not see opportunities for
the future. Many of these countries have large
youth bulges, which can put downward pressure on employment and earnings. Many also
have education and training systems that are
not developing the kinds of skills needed by
the private sector. On closer inspection, the
problem is often more on the demand side
than the supply side, with limited compe­
tition reducing employment opportunities,
especially in more skill-intensive sectors. In
these settings, removing privilege in business
entry and access to jobs is likely to have large
development payoffs.

• Aging

societies also face generational issues,
but these stem from a shrinking working-age
population and the high cost of providing
and caring for a growing number of elderly
people. The impact of the declining workingage population can be mitigated through policies for active aging, ensuring that the most
productive members of society, including
the highly skilled elderly, can work. Containing the increase in pension, health care, and
long-term care costs can be achieved through
reforms in program design, but these reforms
can be a source of social strain.

Natural endowments, including geography,
and institutions can create unique jobs challenges.

	

Moving jobs center stage   

• Resource-rich countries may have substantial

foreign exchange earnings, but this wealth
may not translate into employment creation
beyond the exploitation of natural resources.
Indeed, the abundance of foreign exchange
can hamper the competitiveness of other export activities. Some resource-rich countries
distribute part of their wealth through transfers or subsidized public sector jobs, while
relying on migrants to do menial work. This
approach can maintain living standards but at
the expense of productivity growth and social
cohesion. In those countries, jobs that support the diversification of exports can have
large development payoffs.

• Small island nations, because of their size and

remoteness, cannot reap the benefits from
agglomeration and global integration except
through tourism. So the productivity spillovers from jobs are limited, as are employment opportunities outside basic services and
government. Outmigration offers an alternative for improving living standards, while
return migration and diaspora communities
can stimulate the diffusion of new business
ideas among locals.

• In conflict-affected countries, the most imme-

diate challenge is to support social cohesion.
Employment for ex-combatants or young
men vulnerable to participation in violence
takes on particular importance. With fragile
institutions and volatile politics, attracting
private investment and connecting to global
value chains may be out of reach for quite
some time. Yet construction can boom even
in poor business environments, and it is labor intensive. Investments in infrastructure
can not only support social cohesion through
their direct employment impact, they can also
be a step in preparing for future private sector
job creation.

These criteria are not mutually exclusive.
Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo
are both resource rich and conflict affected;
Jordan and Armenia are formalizing and also
have high youth unemployment. Still, looking through the jobs lens and focusing on the
key features of the different country types can
help identify more clearly the kinds of jobs

that would make the greatest contribution to
development in each case. This focus allows
for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs
between living standards, productivity, and
social cohesion in a specific context. It provides clues about the obstacles to job creation
and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers
(figure 14).

Migration of people—and of jobs
The movement of people and jobs implies that
jobs challenges, while being country specific,
also have a global scope. These processes have
implications for living standards and productivity at both the sending and the receiving ends,
and they can transform families and entire communities, for better or for worse. Tradeoffs are
inevitable, and coping with them only through
the policies of receiving countries alone may
prove unsatisfactory.
At the turn of the 21st century, there were
more than 200 million international migrants
worldwide, nearly 90 million of them workers. Many migrants are temporary or seasonal
workers who eventually return home. Some
countries are mainly recipients, while others are
sources, and yet others neither host nor send
significant numbers of migrants (map 1). Some
are large recipients either in absolute numbers
(for instance, the United States) or in relative
terms (Jordan and Singapore). Migrants from
Bangladesh, Mexico, and India represent a large
share of total migrants worldwide; Fiji, Jamaica,
and Tonga have a large share of their population
overseas. Figures for some of the smaller countries are striking. For instance, about a fifth of
all Salvadorians live abroad, while more than 60
percent of the populations of Kuwait, Qatar, and
the United Arab Emirates are foreign-born.71
International migration increases the incomes of migrants and their families through
earnings and remittances. The majority of the
studies find either no effect or a very small negative effect on the labor earnings of locals in receiving countries. Migrants also contribute to
global output if their productivity abroad is
higher than it would be at home, which is usually
the case. They may even contribute to output in
the sending country, as networks of migrants
and returnees channel investments, innovation,

and expertise. Social effects are more mixed.
On the positive side, migration connects people
from different cultures in ways bound to widen
their horizons. On the negative side, the separation from family and friends can be a source of
distress and isolation. Migration may also bring
racial prejudice and heighten social tensions in
host countries, especially when migrants are secluded in segregated occupations or neighborhoods, preventing their integration in society.
Jobs are on the move as well. The past four
decades have been marked by the outsourcing of
manufacturing tasks from industrial countries
to the developing world, especially to East Asia
(figure 15). More recently, the same pattern is
observable for service tasks. In fact, services are
the fastest-growing component of global trade.
Developing countries are now exporting not
only traditional services, such as transportation
and tourism, but also modern and skill-intensive services, such as financial intermediation,

computer and information services, legal and
technical support, and other business services.
India was the pioneer, but other countries—
Brazil, Chile, China, and Malaysia, to name a
few—have also seized the opportunity.72
The obvious winners of job migration are the
workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which
industries and splintered service jobs have migrated. This migration, along with the transfer
of new technologies and advanced management
methods, contributes to productivity growth
and higher living standards. The hidden winners of job migration are consumers worldwide.
The improved international division of labor increases the availability of goods and services and
enhances the possibility of gaining from trade.
The clear losers are those who have seen their
jobs disappear because of the declining competitiveness of their industries and services. Among
the losers, many skilled workers find comparable
jobs without a substantial loss in salary, but oth-

ers do not. Low-skilled workers or those with
industry- or occupation-specific skills that are
no longer in demand are those who suffer most.

Policies through the jobs lens
While it is not the role of governments to create
jobs, government functions are fundamental for
sustained job creation. The quality of the civil

service is critically important for development,
whether it is teachers building skills, agricultural extension agents improving agricultural
productivity, or urban planners designing functional cities. Temporary employment programs
for the demobilization of combatants are also
justified in some circumstances. But as a general
rule it is the private sector that creates jobs. The
role of government is to ensure that the conditions are in place for strong private-sector-led

Because jobs improve with
development, providing higher earnings and
benefits as countries grow rich, a prerequisite
is to create a policy environment that is conducive to growth. Macroeconomic stability,
an enabling business environment, human
capital accumulation, and the rule of law are
among the fundamentals. Ensuring macroeconomic stability involves containing volatility and avoiding major misalignments of relative prices. Adequate infrastructure, access to
finance, and sound regulation are key ingredients of the business environment. Good nutrition, health, and education outcomes not only
improve people’s lives but also equip them for
productive employment. The rule of law includes protection of property rights and also
the progressive realization of rights at work, to
avoid a situation where growth co­exists with
unacceptable forms of employment.

chanically deliver employment, a second layer
is to ensure that labor policies do not undermine job creation and instead enhance the development payoffs from jobs. But labor market imperfections should not be addressed
through institutional failures. Instead, they
should remain on a range—a plateau—where
negative efficiency effects are modest. Labor
policy should avoid two cliffs: the distortionary interventions that clog the creation of jobs
in cities and in global value chains, and the
lack of mechanisms for voice and protection
for the most vulnerable workers, regardless of
whether they are wage earners. The first cliff
undermines the development payoffs from
agglomeration and global integration; the
second leads to low living standards and a social cohesion deficit.

• Priorities. Because some jobs do more for development than others, it is necessary to understand where good jobs for development
lie, given the country context. More selective
policy interventions are justified when incentives are distorted, resulting in too few of

those jobs. If this is the case, policies should
remove the market imperfections and institutional failures that prevent the private sector
from creating more good jobs for development. If the failures and imperfections cannot be clearly identified, or cannot be easily
removed, offsetting them may be an option,
but the costs and benefits of doing so need to
be carefully assessed.

F I G U R E 16  
Three

distinct layers of policies are needed

PRIORITIES

Fundamentals: Ensuring the basics
Macroeconomic stability. Volatility hurts employment and earnings, often immediately. According to a recent estimate, a 1.0 percent decline
in gross domestic product (GDP) is associated
with an increase in the unemployment rate of
0.19 percentage point in Japan, 0.45 percentage
point in the United States, and 0.85 percentage
point in Spain.73 In developing countries, where
farming and self-employment are more prevalent and income support mechanisms are more
limited, the short-term impact of macroeconomic instability is less on open unemployment
and more on earnings from work.74
Volatility can originate internally or be
caused by external shocks. Internally, it is often
the outcome of unsustainable budget deficits
and lax monetary policy. But tight budgets and
rigid monetary policy rules may not be a magic
wand. Budget deficits are more or less worrisome depending on how quickly an economy is
growing, whereas the independence of central
banks needs to be weighed against the overall
coherence of the country’s development strategy. Assessing the soundness of macroeconomic
management requires taking account of the
impact of fiscal and monetary policies on economic growth.75
Volatility may also result from external shocks,
including natural disasters and crises originating abroad. Precautionary policies can cushion
those shocks, if and when they occur. Most often,
short-term stimulus or adjustment packages are
needed—but these tend to be less effective in the
developing world than in developed countries
because of lower multiplier effects.76
Avoiding exchange rate misalignment is necessary to sustain a vibrant export sector—and
thus to create jobs connected to international
markets and global value chains. Surges in a
country’s foreign exchange earnings generally

lead to an overvaluation of its currency, making
imports more affordable and exports less competitive. Resource-rich countries face similar
pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and
the commodity booms of the last few years have
only made these pressures stronger. Currency
overvaluation can also happen in countries
where large volumes of foreign assistance are
needed to jump-start development, cope with
natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a
conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries
between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters
growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and has a negative impact
on export diversification.77
An enabling business environment. Finance,
infrastructure, and business regulations set the
quality of the investment climate and thus influence job creation by private firms. Access to
finance, a chief constraint to business expansion in countries in every development phase,
is the top constraint in low- and upper-middleincome countries (figure 17). Financial markets
have the potential to allocate resources toward
more productive uses, thwart the channeling
of resources to those with political connections
or economic power, and expand financial in-

clusion. But regulatory oversight is needed to
ensure transparency and competition in how
funds are allocated.78 The financial crisis of 2008
reopened heated debates on the appropriate
regulation of the financial sector and the need
to balance prudence and stability with innovation and inclusion.
Access to affordable and quality infrastructure is a prerequisite for firms to operate. Power
shortages are the number-two constraint to
firm growth and job creation mentioned by
entrepreneurs the world over—and number
one in low-income countries. Telecommunications allow for a better flow of information with
suppliers and customers, and the internet and
mobile technology facilitate the spread of new
ideas. Roads provide greater access to markets,
as do ports and airports.79 The way infrastructure is regulated is important as well. Inadequate pricing policies and regulations amplify
the gap in needed infrastructure services. In
many countries, monopolies based on political connections have led to reduced quantities
of infrastructure services at higher prices and
lower quality.80
Business regulation also affects the opportunities for businesses to grow and create jobs.
Regulations can increase the cost of doing business, in money or in time needed to comply.
Steps taken to meet requirements or to pay fees
are a burden for businesses, as are delays or discretionary decisions, such as those for permits
or licenses. There is great variation across firms
in the same location with regard to the time it

takes to comply with regulations or to receive
permits.81 Business regulations also affect competition and thus the pressure to innovate and
increase productivity. Across countries, regulations on business entry are inversely correlated
with productivity and firm creation, with stronger effects in sectors that have higher rates of
entry.82 In Mexico, easing entry requirements
increased business registration and employment and drove down consumer prices, largely
through creating new firms rather than formalizing informal firms.83
Human capital. Good outcomes in nutrition,
health, and education are development goals
in themselves, because they directly improve
people’s lives. But they also equip people for
productive employment and job opportunities—and through this channel, human capital drives economic and social advances. There
is robust evidence from throughout the world
that an additional year of schooling raises earnings substantially, and that this earnings premium reflects the higher productivity of more
educated workers.84 Together, nutrition, health,
and education combine to form human skills
and abilities that have been powerfully linked to
productivity growth and poverty reduction in
the medium to longer run.85 Also, better health
brings, directly, higher labor productivity. As
such, human capital is a fundamental ingredient for desirable job outcomes.
Human capital formation is cumulative.
Of crucial importance are adequate health
and nutrition during “the first 1,000 days,”

	

from conception to two years of age. Brain
devel­opment in this time period affects physical health, learning abilities, and social behavior throughout life.86 Ensuring adequate
nutrition, health, and cognitive stimulation
through a nurturing environment from the
womb through the first years raises returns to
later child investments significantly.87 While
foundations are laid early on, human capital
and skills continue to be formed throughout
childhood and young adulthood. Schooling is fundamental for the further development of cognitive and social skills until the
end of the teenage life. Social skills remain
malleable through adolescence and the early
adult years.88 Young adults can continue
into more specialized skill-building, including at tertiary levels, but success depends on
whether the generic skills needed to learn
and adapt to different tasks and problemsolving environments have been acquired.
These general skills are especially important in
more dynamic economic environments.
Unfortunately, the evidence shows that many
countries are falling short in building up the
human capital of their children and youth. The
quality of delivery systems has often failed to
keep pace with the expansion of access to basic
social services. In a large majority of developing countries that took part in the Programme
for International Student Assessment (PISA) in
2009, at least one-fifth of 15-year-old students
were functionally illiterate (not reaching at least
level 2 in the PISA reading assessment).89
The rule of law. Across countries, the presence of institutions that protect property rights,
uphold the rule of law, and rein in corruption is
associated with higher levels of development.90
Property rights foster private sector growth by
allowing firms to invest without the fear that
their assets will be stolen or confiscated.91 The
ability to enforce contracts widens the circle
of potential suppliers and customers, as personal connections become less important in
establishing trust.92 The rule of law has direct
implications for the growth of firms and jobs.
Entrepreneurs who believe their property rights
are secure reinvest more of their profits than
those who do not.93 Conversely, rampant crime
and violence are likely to drive firms away and
discourage domestic and foreign investment.94
Across countries, investment climate surveys

Moving jobs center stage   

consistently find crime and corruption to be obstacles to conducting business.95
An effective judicial system is a key institution for enforcing property rights and reducing crime and corruption. An independent,
accountable, and fair judiciary can contribute
to private sector growth and job creation by enforcing the rules that govern transactions and
by helping ensure that the costs and benefits of
growth are fairly distributed. The justice system
can enforce contracts, reduce transaction costs
for firms, and create a safe and more predictable
business environment.96 And effective courts increase the willingness of firms to invest.97
An institutional environment that respects
rights is an important ingredient of the rule of
law and a foundation for good jobs for development. The ILO’s core labor standards provide a
floor in the areas of child labor, forced labor,
discrimination, and freedom of association
and collective bargaining.98 Health and safety
at work also call for attention by governments
and employers. Ensuring that standards are
applied in practice requires providing access to
information to workers and employers. It also
implies expanding legal coverage to workers in
jobs that fall outside formal laws and regulations. Associations of informal workers can
inform them about their rights, help them use
legal mechanisms, and offer them collective
voice.99

Labor policies: Avoiding the two cliffs
A malfunctioning labor market may prevent
economic growth from translating into more
and better jobs. Traditional analyses focus on
labor supply, labor demand, and their matching
to explain why there may not be enough employment, or not enough wage employment in the
case of developing countries. By not addressing
labor market imperfections, or by creating them,
labor policies can indeed constrain job creation,
even seriously. In many cases, however, the constraints to creating transformational jobs are not
connected to the labor code. The low productivity of smallholder farming in agrarian economies is probably more closely related to failures
in agricultural research and extension. And the
lack of competition in technologically advanced
activities that could boost the demand for skilled
work in countries with high youth unemploy-

26

ment is more likely to stem from cronyism and
political favoritism.
There is no consensus on what the content
of labor policies should be. Views are polarized,
reflecting differences in fundamental beliefs. To
some, labor market regulations and collective
bargaining are sources of inefficiency that reduce output and employment, while protecting
insiders at the expense of everyone else. In this
view, unemployment insurance and active labor
market programs create work disincentives and
are a waste of money. To others, these policies
provide necessary protection to workers against
the power of employers and the vagaries of the
market. They can even contribute to economic
efficiency by improving information, insuring
against risks, and creating conditions for longterm investments by both workers and firms.
Advocates of both views can find examples
to support their positions. Those who see labor
policies and institutions as part of the problem
point to the impressive long-term job creation
record of the United States, a country with limited interventions in the labor market. They also
point to the protective job security rules that
have impeded young people from finding work
in many North African and Southern European
countries. By contrast, those who see labor policies as part of the solution point to job-sharing
as decisive in Germany’s relative success in
weathering the financial crisis.
A careful review of the actual effects of labor
policies in developing countries yields a mixed
picture. Most studies find that impacts are modest—certainly more modest than the intensity
of the debate would suggest.100 Across firm sizes
and country levels of development, labor policies and regulations are generally not among the
top three constraints that formal private enterprises face. Excessive or insufficient regulation
of labor markets reduces productivity. But in
between these extremes is a plateau where effects enhancing and undermining efficiency can
be found side by side and most of the impact
is redistributive, generally to the advantage of
middle-aged male workers (as opposed to owners of capital, women, and younger workers).
In most countries that have been studied,
job security rules and minimum wages have a
small effect on aggregate employment. These
rules offer benefits for those who are covered,
while negative effects tend to be concentrated on

youth, women, and the less skilled. In Colombia
and Indonesia, minimum wage increases had
only a modest overall effect but the employment
impact was stronger for young workers.101 Regulations more clearly affect job flows, creating
“stickiness” in the labor market and slowing the
pace of labor reallocation.­102 While this hinders
economic efficiency, the evidence on productivity is fairly inconclusive, though admittedly
scarce.103
In developing countries, collective bargaining does not have a major impact outside the
public sector and activities characterized by
limited competition, where there are rents to
share.104 Unions consistently raise wages for
workers. Studies place this premium in the 5 to
15 percent range in Mexico; around 5 percent
in Korea; and at 10 to 20 percent in South Africa.105 The costs in terms of reduced jobs are
not so clear, however. In some countries, though
not all, the tradeoff seems to be lower employment, but even then the magnitudes are relatively small. The limited evidence on union effects on productivity is also mixed.106 The main
challenges are extending voice to those who are
not wage earners, so that the constraints facing
their farms and microenterprises can be addressed, and organizing collective bargaining in
a way that enhances productivity.
Active labor market programs, such as training, employment services, wage subsidies, and
public works, have a mixed record.107 When they
are not well grounded in the needs and realities
of the labor market or when administration is
poor and not transparent, they are of little use
or even worse. When they are well designed and
implemented, they can help facilitate job matching, mitigate the negative impacts of economic
downturns, and fill the gap when employers
or workers underinvest in training (figure 18).
Even when this is the case, though, effects tend
to be modest, so expectations about what active
labor market policies can achieve need to be
held in check.
Social insurance coverage is limited even in
the most formalized developing countries. Unemployment insurance can help workers manage the risks of job loss, but it can also weaken
job search efforts. When unemployment insurance, pensions, health care, and other benefits
are financed through the payroll, high contribution rates can create hiring disincentives. In

developing countries where formal sectors are
small, funding these programs through general
taxation is increasingly discussed,108 but any
taxes create distortions. In the end, there is no
substitute for affordable social protection benefits that are valued by workers. The main issue
is coherently integrating social protection and
social assistance to minimize gaps and overlaps.
In sum, labor policies and institutions can
improve labor market information, manage
risk, and provide voice. But these advantages
can come at the expense of labor market dynamism, reduced incentives for job creation
and job search, and a gap in benefits between
the covered and uncovered. The challenge is to
set labor policies on a plateau—a range where
regulations and institutions can at least partially
address labor market imperfections without
reducing efficiency. Labor market rules that
are too weak or programs that are too modest
or nonexistent can leave problems of poor information, unequal power, and inadequate risk
management untreated. In contrast, rules that
are too stringent and programs that are too ambitious can compound market imperfections
with institutional failures.
The focus on good jobs for development offers some insights to assess where the edges of
the plateau, the cliffs, may lie. At one end of the
plateau are labor policies that slow job creation
in cities, or in global value chains, and make
countries miss out on jobs supporting agglomeration effects and knowledge spillovers. Forgoing the development payoffs from urbanization
and global integration would be a consequence
of falling off the cliff. This is not necessarily an
argument for minimum regulation. There is also
scope for arrangements strengthening spatial
coordination, and thus increasing efficiency, as
suggested by China’s recent experience with collective bargaining.
At the other end of the plateau, the absence
of mechanisms for voice and protection for
those who do not work for an employer, or do so
in the informal sector, is also a concern. Extending voice for workers who are often among the
poorest may result in higher living standards.
Limiting abuses by employment intermediaries should enhance efficiency, and building inclusive social protection systems can contribute
to greater social cohesion. The experience of

Priorities: Realizing the development
payoffs from jobs
In addition to ensuring that the fundamentals support growth and that labor policies are
­adequate, decision makers can help realize the
development payoffs that come from jobs. Some
jobs do more than others for living standards,
productivity, and social cohesion. What those
jobs are depends on the country context—its
level of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. In some circumstances,
there will be no constraints to the emergence of
good jobs for development, and no specific policy will be needed. In others, governments can
support the private sector in creating more of
these jobs. Sometimes this can be achieved by removing constraints that impede the creation of
jobs with high development payoffs. When this
is not possible, policies can be more proactive
and bypass the constraints, provided that the
gains to society from doing so outweigh the cost.

A simple approach to setting policy priorities
follows five steps (figure 19):

• Step one: What are good jobs for development?

Assessing the development payoffs from
jobs in a particular country context is the first
step in identifying priorities. The nature of
those jobs varies with the characteristics of
the country, including its phase of development, demography, endowments, and institutions. Jobs challenges are not the same in
agrarian economies, resource-rich countries,
conflict-affected countries, or in countries
with high youth unemployment. And the jobs
with the greatest development impact differ
as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas.

• Step

two: Are there enough of these jobs? A
country may or may not face constraints in
creating good jobs for development. For example, light manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on poverty. If a boom is under
way, the development value of new manufacturing jobs might materialize. But it might
not if, for example, inadequate urbanization
policies limit the establishment of new firms.

In the absence of gaps of this sort, it is difficult
to justify government interventions beyond
establishing the fundamentals and adopting
adequate labor policies.
Data and analysis can be used to identify misaligned incentives, indicated by a
gap between the individual and the social
value of jobs. Several research areas deal with
these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can measure the tax burden that
applies to capital and labor and assess the crosssubsidization between individuals or firms.
The methods of labor economics can uncover
gaps between the actual earnings of specific
groups of workers and their potential earnings,
or between the social and individual returns to
schooling. Poverty analyses help in identifying
the kind of jobs that are more likely to provide
opportunities to the poor, or the locations
where job creation would have a greater impact on reducing poverty. Productivity studies allow for quantifying the spillovers from
employment in foreign-owned investment
companies, or in cities. Environmental studies
shed light on the carbon footprint and pollution created by various types of jobs. And val-

	

Moving jobs center stage   

ues surveys can discover which types of jobs
provide social networks and social identity.

• Step three: Can the constraints be identified?

The gaps between the individual and social
values of specific types of jobs indicate unexploited spillovers from jobs. The gaps typically arise from market imperfections and institutional failures that cause people to work
in jobs that are suboptimal from a social point
of view, lead firms to create jobs that are not
as good for development as they should be, or
connect people less through jobs than would
be socially desirable. But identifying those
constraints is not always easy. For instance,
a broad set of cultural, social, and economic
forces may result in insufficient employment
opportunities for women. Similarly, the obstacles to more jobs in cities could be in the
land market, or in the institutional arrangements to coordinate urban development,
or in the ability to raise revenue to finance
infrastructure.

• Step four: Can the constraints be removed? If

the institutional failures and market imperfections leading to misaligned incentives can
be identified, reforms should be considered. It
is a good economic principle to target reforms
on the failures and imperfections at the root
of the problem. Where reforms are technically
and politically feasible, policy makers can directly tackle the major constraints hindering
the creation of more good jobs for development by the private sector.

• Step five: Can the constraints be offset? ­Reforms

might not be feasible, technically or politically.
Or perhaps the constraints for jobs are not
identifiable. An alternative then is to adopt
offsetting policies that can restore the incentives for job creation. For instance, if a diffuse but entrenched set of norms and beliefs
makes it difficult for women to work, efforts
could aim at increasing their employability
through targeted investments in social and
physical infrastructure (box 1). Similarly, if
politically charged regulations slow down the
reallocation of labor toward more productive
activities, urban infrastructure and logistics
could enhance the attractiveness of jobs in
cities and jobs connected to world markets.

But there are cases when constraints can neither be removed nor offset. An engagement strategy involving a deeper analysis of the options
and buy-in by key stakeholders is needed then.
Policy making to remove or offset constraints
needs to be selective and supported by good
public finance principles. The costs and benefits
of policy options need to be assessed, but calculations are different when the overall development impact is the guiding objective. An employment program to demobilize ex-combatants
in a c­ onflict-affected country could be assessed
in terms of whether the earnings gains of participants justify the program costs, but a full
­accounting should also incorporate the potentially positive effects from reintegration and
peace building. In the Democratic Republic of
Congo, the cost of an integration program for
ex-combatants was about US$800 per beneficiary.110 Such a program would likely be judged
as cost inefficient by traditional standards.
Whether or not it is still worth implementing
depends on the value policy makers attach to social cohesion benefits. These benefits should be
stated for the policy decision to be transparent.

Diverse jobs agendas, diverse policy
priorities
Some countries have successfully set policy to
bring out the development payoffs from jobs, in
ways that provide a model to others.
As an agrarian country, in the 1990s Vietnam concentrated on increasing productivity
in agriculture, freeing labor to work in rural
off-farm employment and eventually supporting migration to cities. In 1993, more than 70
percent of employment was in agriculture, 58
percent of the population lived in poverty, and
famine was still a real concern.111 Two decades
later, Vietnam is the second-largest exporter
of rice and coffee; the largest exporter of black
pepper and cashew nuts; and a top exporter of
tea, rubber, and seafood products. Poverty has
declined dramatically. Combined with a strong
emphasis on agricultural extension, land reform
and deregulation led to rapidly growing agricultural productivity on very small farm plots.
These policies were part of a broader package
of reforms, or Doi Moi, that took Vietnam from
central planning to a market economy with a
socialist orientation.112 Policies also aimed at

BOX 1 

How does women’s labor force participation increase?

Some developing countries have experienced important increases
in women’s labor participation over a relatively short period of time.
Nowhere has the change been faster than in Latin America. Since
the 1980s, more than 70 million women have entered the labor
force, raising the female labor participation rate from 36 percent to
43 percent. In Colombia, the rate increased from 47 percent in 1984
to 65 percent in 2006. By contrast, in the Middle East and North
Africa, women’s labor force participation has only grown by 0.17
percentage points per year over the last three decades.
Recent research attributes this rapid transformation to increases
in labor force participation among married or cohabiting women
with children, rather than to demographics, education, or business
cycles. Changes in social attitudes contributed to the transformation, but this is a complex area with limited scope—and justification—for direct policy intervention. For instance, women’s participation rates are very low in the West Bank and Gaza, particularly
among married women. But this cannot be mechanically attributed
to religion, as countries like Indonesia have high participation rates.
Other social norms and regulations prevent women from participating, despite their willingness and capacity to do so.
While the scope to influence social attitudes is limited, evidence
suggests that public policies and programs in other areas have an
important role to play. It also suggests that a combination of targeted investments and interventions in social and physical infrastructure can modify women’s labor force participation and the

returns to their earnings. These investments can be categorized into
three groups. They can address shortages in the availability of services (such as lack of electricity or daycare facilities) that force women
to allocate large amounts of time to home production. They can
make it easier for women to accumulate productive assets, such
as education, capital, and land, facilitating their entry into high-­
productivity market activities. And they can remove norms or regulations that imply biased or even discriminatory practices, preventing
women from having equal employment opportunities.
There are successful experiences with targeted investments
and interventions of each of these three sorts. Public provision or
subsidization of child care can reduce the costs women incur at
home when they engage in market work. Examples include publicly provided or subsidized day care such as Estancias Infantiles in
Mexico, Hogares Comunitarios in Colombia, and similar programs
in Argentina and Brazil. Improvements in infrastructure services—
especially in water and electricity—can free up women’s time
spent on domestic and care work. Electrification in rural South
Africa, for instance, has increased women’s labor force participation by about 9 percent. Correcting biases in service delivery institutions, such as the workings of government land distribution and
registration schemes, allows women to own and inherit assets.
Finally, the use of active labor market policies, the promotion of
networks, and the removal of discriminatory regulations are important to make work more rewarding for women.

creating employment opportunities outside agriculture. The country opened to foreign investors, first in natural resource exploitation and
light manufacturing, and then more broadly in
the context of its accession to the World Trade
Organization in 2007. Registered FDI increased
fourfold in just two years, from 1992 to 1994;
over the past five years, FDI inflows exceeded 8
percent of GDP.113
Rwanda, a conflict-affected country, has rebounded after the ethnic conflict and destruction
of the mid-1990s. By 2000, Rwanda’s economy
had returned to precrisis levels as a result of the
cessation of conflict as well as an aggressive package of reforms.114 Growth has continued, reaching an estimated 8.8 percent in 2011, and the
poverty rate fell by 12 percentage points between
2005 and 2010. In the wake of the conflict, the
government supported the reintegration and demobilization of more than 54,000 former combatants. In 2012, 73 percent of ex-combatants

expressed satisfaction with their social integration, and 85 percent of community members
felt there was trust between the two groups.115
While ex-combatants were only a small share of
Rwanda’s population of 10 million, their reintegration had payoffs for social cohesion. Rwanda
has built on this start by rejuvenating the private
sector through reforms of institutions and business regulations.116 The coffee industry has created thousands of new jobs.117
Chile, a resource-rich country, has managed
its copper riches in a way compatible with job
creation in nonresource sectors. Home to more
than a quarter of the world’s copper reserves,
Chile diversified its exports and its economy
while effectively managing resource-related
risks such as currency appreciation and inflation. Unemployment fell to single digits from
around 20 percent in the early 1980s.118 A resource stabilization fund (since 1987) to­gether
with a transparent fiscal rule (since 1999) al-

	

lowed the country to save for difficult times and
avoid a loss of competitiveness. Governance reforms in all areas of public sector management
promoted accountability and transparency. An
active export-oriented growth policy, including
the welcoming of foreign investment, supported
productivity spillovers from jobs connected to
global markets. Competitive innovation funds
for nonmineral export sectors, especially in
agribusiness, have broadened the export base.119
The public budget boosted education spending,
which almost doubled between 1990 and 2009,
leading to an unprecedented expansion of secondary and tertiary education.120
Slovenia has successfully tackled its very high
youth unemployment rate, reducing the ratio of
youth to adult unemployment from three in
the 1990s to around two today.121 The success
in reducing youth unemployment cannot be
­attributed to spending on active labor market
programs (about average for transition countries), liberalizing the labor market (rules remain more restrictive than the average in developed countries), or low minimum wages
(still on the high side).122 Potential distortions
from these policies seem to be somewhat offset, however, by a model of consensus-based
decision making whereby trade unions and
employer organizations, with broad coverage,
set wages that respond well to macroeconomic
trends and sectoral productivity.123 Sustained
growth before the global crisis is ultimately
responsible for much of Slovenia’s decline in
youth unemployment. Taking advantage of
European integration, the economy successfully restructured its export sector. Very good
infrastructure and a fairly well-skilled workforce helped as well.
Examples of successful policies can actually be found across the entire typology of jobs
challenges (figure 20). As an urbanizing country, Korea carefully designed and phased policies to accompany the transition of jobs from
agriculture to light manufacturing and then
to industries with higher value added.124 Land
­development programs were established first,
followed by a land-use regulation system, and
then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held the diseconomies of urbanization in check. Tonga, a
small island nation, is actively using the Recognized Seasonal Employer program launched by

Moving jobs center stage   

New Zealand in 2007 to provide employment
opportunities through migration, leading to
higher remittances, improved knowledge of
agricultural techniques, computer literacy,
and English-language skills.125 Brazil provides
an example of a rapidly formalizing country.
Over the past decade, job creation in the formal sector has been three times as rapid as in
the informal sector. Just in the five years leading up to the crisis, the formal share of total
employment increased by about 5 percentage
points.126 Non-contributory social protection
programs such as Bolsa Familia, a simplification of tax rules for small business, increased
incentives for firms to formalize their workers, and improved enforcement of tax and
labor regulations contributed to this success.
Poland, an aging society, has seen its employment ratio increase from 60 percent in 2006 to
65 percent in 2009. This was due to changes in
the application of eligibility rules of disability pensions, and pension reforms adjusting
the level of benefits down as life expectancy
increases. In 2012, a new wave of pension reforms raised the retirement age to 67 for men
and women from the current 65 for men and
60 for women.127

Connected jobs agendas: Global
partnerships for jobs
Policies for jobs in one country can have spillovers to other countries, both positive and negative. An important issue is whether international
coordination mechanisms could influence government decisions to enhance the positive spillovers and mitigate the negative. Several a­reas
lend themselves to more and better coordination.
Rights and standards. Cross-border mechanisms exist to set standards and provide channels for improving compliance with rights. ILO
conventions can influence domestic legislation
and be a channel for voice and coordination internationally, as demonstrated by the process of
adopting the conventions for home-based and
domestic workers. The support for core labor
standards in the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work suggests
that countries respond to pressure from the international community.128 Yet the pressure only
goes so far. The persistence of forced labor, children working in hazardous conditions, discrimi-

nation, and lack of voice suggest that ratification
on its own is not sufficient.
Trade agreements are a potential instrument
for international coordination on rights. They
can incorporate incentives for attention to voice
and working conditions by linking trade access
to the adoption and enforcement of labor laws
and standards. Whether linking rights to trade
actually leads to better outcomes for workers on
either side of a trade agreement is less clear. Labor clauses can be used as a protectionist tool,
undermining trade and employment opportunities in developing countries. Moreover, in the
absence of capacity and institutions to monitor and enforce compliance, trade agreements
on their own can be weak instruments. For
instance, Cambodia’s successful bilateral trade
agreement with the United States was accompa-

nied by two projects, one to build capacity for
monitoring working conditions in garment factories and one to support an arbitration council
to resolve collective labor disputes.129
Beyond the initiatives of governments
through conventions and trade agreements, a
growing emphasis is being placed on private
sector accountability and the broader corporate
social responsibility (CSR) agenda, whereby
companies voluntarily bring social and environmental concerns into their operations.130
Codes of conduct are most likely to be adopted
by companies based in the European Union and
North America, which then make engagement
with labor standards a condition of business
with suppliers. But there is limited evidence on
the extent to which codes of conduct translate
into improved enforcement of standards. Be-

	

cause of the complexity of global supply chains,
seasonal and temporary workers are outside the
reach of CSR frameworks. Workers outside of
global supply chains are not covered.131 To be effective, CSR efforts should focus more on building the capacity of local firms to comply and the
capacity of labor inspectorates to do their work.
Trade and investment. International trade
in goods has been gradually liberalized over
time, and the notion that freer trade is mutually beneficial for the transacting parties is
now widely shared. However, many developing
countries still lack the competitiveness to harness the benefits from global integration. Direct
assistance to reduce logistic costs and improve
the competitiveness of firms and farms is thus
a priority. Aid for trade has increased substantially and now accounts for about a third of
total aid to developing countries. But there is
scope for making the assistance more effective,
by focusing on the export activities most suited
to address the specific jobs challenges that recipient countries face. Increasing the involvement by the private sector would also enhance
the effectiveness of the assistance.132
In contrast to trade in goods, progress in
services liberalization has been slow, at both
the multilateral and the regional levels. Offers
to the Doha Round currently being negotiated
promise greater security in access to markets
but no additional liberalization compared to
the policies in force.133 Services are characterized by well-known market imperfections—
from network externalities in infrastructure to
asymmetric information and moral hazard in
finance—and are thus subject to more pervasive regulations. Liberalizing trade in services
requires adequate domestic regulation. Setting
up markets for electricity, or cushioning the social impacts of large distributors on retail trade,
is challenging.134 Not surprisingly, liberalization
of services is much less advanced in developing
countries than in industrial countries.135
The productivity gains from liberalizing
services would be substantial. Many services
are inputs into the production process. Electricity, finance, telecommunications, and trade
have a direct impact on business costs, affecting
the competitiveness of downstream sectors. By
boosting job creation and raising labor earnings, these productivity gains should also lead
to improved living standards. Social impacts

can be more mixed. They are clearly positive
when cell phones connect people (and especially
the poor) to product markets, to employment
­opportunities, or to government services. They
can be negative when the disappearance of retail
trade leads to the decline of urban centers and
affects the livelihoods of older shopkeepers who
may not find alternative employment easily. An
adequate sequencing of services liberalization
and domestic regulatory reform is needed to
manage these tradeoffs, and, in doing so, address the concerns of developing countries.136
International collaboration can fill the knowledge gaps and facilitate implementation.137
International agreements can also promote
global public goods. One case in point is gender equality. Trade is not gender neutral, implying that liberalization changes women’s access
to jobs. Traditionally men were more likely to
have “brawn jobs,” involving stronger physical requirements, while “brain jobs” involving
dexterity, attention, or communication—from
stitching garments to processing data—present
more opportunities for women. Call centers in
Delhi and Mumbai employ more than 1 million
people, most of them women. Preferential access for imports from sectors with more “brain
jobs” can thus create employment opportunities
for women in countries where gender equality
is far from attained.138 But as countries move
up the ladder of global value chains, gender
opportunities can change. This was the case in
Malaysia, where the share of women working in
manufacturing declined in the mid-1980s.139
Migration. In contrast to the movement of
goods and services across borders, few international agreements pertain to migration in general and the migration of workers in particular.
Those in existence have limited coverage. ILO
conventions 97 and 143, in force since 1952 and
1978, refer to the prevention of discrimination
or abusive conditions against migrants and call
for penalties and sanctions against those who
promote clandestine or illegal migration. But
they have been ratified by only 49 and 23 countries, respectively. Liberalizing the provision of
services by natural persons, in line with Mode 4
of the General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS), is not on the agenda of many countries,
industrial or developing. And the United Nations international convention on the rights of
migrant workers and their families, which en-

33

34  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

tered into force in 2003, has been ratified by only
22 countries—mostly sending countries.
While migration occurs across borders, legislation is mostly driven by country-specific
laws. This is an area where a global perspective is warranted, but views on what needs to
be done are diverse. One view focuses on the
large earnings differentials between countries,
suggesting that global productivity and poverty reduction would accelerate enormously
with the free movement of labor.140 Another
perspective focuses instead on national security and the protection of communities and
their cultures, implying the need for barriers
to contain migration. Yet another highlights
the moral ­imperative of protecting the human
rights of migrants, no matter their legal status,
and giving shelter to those who suffer any form
of persecution.141 None of these views suffices,
however, because any one of them alone cannot
address the complex tradeoffs that migration
poses for policy design.
In many instances, both sending and receiving countries can benefit from migration
through a collaborative approach. Most abuses
perpetrated by traffickers, firms, or workers
are associated with illegal migrant flows, so the
formalization of these flows is a basic tool for
protecting the rights of migrant workers. This
formalization cannot be enforced without the
cooperation of institutions in both sending and
receiving countries. That is why bilateral agreements are also needed, with provisions for quotas by occupation, industry, region, and duration of stay.142 The agreements can distinguish
between temporary movements of workers
and steps to permanent migration, with conditions and protocols to go from one to another.
They can include considerations about taxation, s­ocial security, and even financing higher
education—a special concern in the case of
“talent” migration. These agreements can design
incentives so that stakeholders in both sending
and receiving countries have an interest in enforcing the provisions.143

Jobs are center stage, but where are
the numbers?
A significant research and data agenda lies
ahead. Further analysis is needed on the rela-

tionship between jobs and movements in and
out of poverty; the dynamics of micro- and
small enterprises in the informal sector; and the
links between jobs and human behaviors and
norms. Research on the magnitude of spillovers
from jobs could identify good jobs for development tailored to country contexts. Another
important research area concerns the impact of
jobs on the acquisition of cognitive and noncognitive skills, and how this impact varies depending on the characteristics of the job and the
person who holds it. Similarly, more evidence
on productivity spillovers from jobs across cities with different characteristics would have a
high value for development policy. Estimates of
the environmental impacts of different types of
jobs are, today, scarce at best. In the area of labor policies, more empirical work is needed on
the boundaries of the plateau, depending on the
characteristics of the country. More research is
also needed on how international trade, investment across borders, and migration affect the
composition of employment across countries.
More solid knowledge on the sequencing of international commitments and domestic policies
related to services could address the reluctance
of developing countries to make further progress in the direction of liberalization and reap
the gains from global integration.
Setting policy priorities for jobs needs to be
based on reliable data. Given that a large share of
the people at work in developing countries are
not wage employees, and that even fewer have a
formal sector job, the measurement of employment is challenging. Determining which jobs
have the greatest payoffs for poverty reduction
requires linking information on a household’s
income or consumption with information on
the employment of its members. Understanding which economic units create more jobs, or
whether labor reallocation leads to substantial
growth rather than just churning, requires information on the inputs and outputs of very
diverse production units. Assessing how the
composition of employment affects trust and
willingness to participate in society requires information on individual values and behaviors.
The paucity of empirical analyses on the employment impact of the global crisis in developing countries and the difficulty of comparing measures of informal employment across
countries suggest that data quality and avail-

	

ability remain a constraint for policy making.
Much e­ffort goes into measuring unemployment rates, and measuring them often.144 But
open unemployment is not a very telling indicator in countries where a large fraction of
the labor force is not salaried. The Millennium
Development Goal on eradicating poverty lists
four indicators to monitor progress toward the
employment target, defined as “achieving full
and productive employment and decent work
for all, including women and young people.”
But these indicators only partially capture advances in the quantity and quality of jobs in the
developing world.145
Today’s challenges for labor statistics can be
regrouped into three key areas: data gaps; data
quality issues; and planning, coordination, and
communication issues. Data gaps concern countries where labor statistics do not exist at all or
are collected only sporadically. Whenever such
statistics exist, data quality is a concern throughout the statistical production chain, from the
use of appropriate definitions to questionnaire
design, from sampling frame to interviewer
processes, and from data entry and coding to
verification and estimation procedures. Planning, coordination, and communication issues
arise when different institutions are responsible
for collecting and disseminating the data.146
A quarter of a century ago, a renewed emphasis on poverty reduction as the key objective of development policy launched a longterm data effort. Across the world, information
on household living standards was collected
through standardized surveys. The sampling
methods and the variable definitions used were

practitioners whenever possible. For jobs, employment modules attached to household surveys used for poverty analyses would need to be

standardized and include informal firms and
microenterprises in establishment surveys. Such
an approach would move jobs center stage.

Countries have a choice in responding to the jobs
challenges of demographics, structural shifts,
technological progress, and periodic macroeconomic crises. They can simply pursue growth,
ensure that the labor market functions well, and
hope that jobs will follow. Or they can recognize that growth does not mechanically deliver
the jobs that do most for development. Jobs for
women, jobs in cities and in global value chains,
and jobs providing voice and protection for the
most vulnerable in society may come high on
the list. The precise nature of the jobs challenge
depends on a country’s geography, endowments,
institutions, and level of development. What is
common to all is the need to remedy the institutional failures and market imperfections that
prevent the private sector from creating more
of those good jobs for development. Countries can then return to the difficult questions
posed at the outset. For each of them, there is
a conventional wisdom that practitioners do
not consider to be totally satisfactory. The jobs
lens in development does not lead to a flat rejection of the conventional wisdom, but to a qualification of when it holds and when it does not.
In short, countries can leave themselves open
to small gains in living standards, slow productivity growth, and fractious societies. Or, by addressing their jobs challenges, they can enjoy
a self-reinforcing pattern of more prosperous
livelihoods, rising productivity, and the stronger social cohesion that comes from improving
­employment opportunities and fairness in access to jobs.

QUESTIONS

When is the conventional wisdom right?

Growth strategies or jobs strategies? The conventional wisdom
is to focus on growth as a precondition for continued
increases in living standards and strengthened social cohesion. But lags and gaps among the three transformations of
living standards, productivity, and social cohesion are not
uncommon. The impact of growth on poverty reduction varies con­siderably across countries. And in some cases, growth
is not accompanied by increased social cohesion—even
though poverty may fall and living standards improve for
some, the expectations of others remain unfulfilled. The
employment intensity of different sectors and fairness in
access to employment opportunities matter as well. It is thus
jobs that bring together the three transformations.
Tradeoffs among improving living standards, accelerating
productivity growth, and fostering social cohesion arguably
reflect a measurement problem, more than a real choice. If
growth indicators captured the intangible social benefits
from jobs, from lower poverty to greater social cohesion, a
growth strategy and a jobs strategy would be equivalent. But
a growth strategy may not pay enough attention to female
employment, or to employment in secondary cities, or to
idleness among youth. When potentially important spillovers from jobs are not realized, a jobs strategy may provide
more useful insights.
Can entrepreneurship be fostered? The conventional wisdom
is that most micro- and small enterprises in developing
countries are just forms of survivorship, with limited chances
to grow. But self-employed workers account for a large share
of employment in developing countries. Even if only a fraction of them succeeded in building a viable business, the
aggregate impact on living standards and productivity would
be substantial. Moreover, in developing countries many large
enterprises are born large, often the result of government
support or privileged access to finance and information.
Breaking privilege is one more reason why the success of
micro- and small enterprises is so important.
Management practices are important in explaining firm
productivity, even in small and medium-size firms. The
capacity to acquire skills and to apply them to business is one
of the most important characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. Yet markets fail to nurture entrepreneurship, because
knowledge spillovers imply that some of the returns to
acquiring or developing new managerial ideas and knowledge are appropriated by others. And the potential to absorb
management practices differs greatly among beneficiaries.
Observable characteristics of small business owners can predict entrepreneurial potential, and programs to upgrade
their managerial capacity have been shown to make a difference. Programs targeted to small business owners with entre-

preneurial potential can thus make a substantial difference
in living standards and productivity.
Can policies contribute to social cohesion? The conventional
wisdom is that a lack of jobs is detrimental to social cohesion,
but other than ensuring full employment there is little that
governments can or should do. Yet open unemployment is
not the main challenge in many countries, as the characteristics of jobs also matter. While not all jobs can positively affect
social cohesion, those that shape social identity, build networks—particularly for excluded groups—and increase fairness can help defuse tensions and support peaceful collective
decision making.
Measures that support inclusion, extend access to voice
and rights, and improve transparency and accountability in
the labor market can increase the extent to which people perceive that they have a stake in society. This perception can be
especially critical when risks of social unrest from youth
unemployment and conflict are high. Employment programs
can undermine social cohesion if they have weak governance
or divisive targeting, but can have positive effects when they
are well-designed. Jobs policies for youth at risk can incorporate counseling and training in conflict resolution. Public
works programs can facilitate community participation and
engagement between citizens and local authorities. Policies
can thus focus not only on the number of jobs, but on expanding job opportunities for excluded groups.
Skills or jobs—what comes first? The conventional wisdom is
that investing in skills will lead to job creation and to higher
productivity and labor income. High unemployment and
skills mismatches are often attributed to shortcomings in
education and training systems. But in reality they can also
result from market distortions, which send the wrong signals
to the education system or lead to a lack of dynamism in private firms. In such situations, massive investments in training systems, as seen in many parts of the world, might show
disappointing results as hoped-for job outcomes do not
materialize.
A core set of basic skills, both cognitive and social, is
necessary for productive employment, and they cannot just
be acquired on the job. Without such generic skills, the
prospects of improving employment opportunities and
earnings are thin. Skills are also critical for countries to
move up the value-added ladder, as they can ignite innovation, produce the benefits of mutual learning, and hence
lead to job creation themselves. But in between, much
learning can happen through work: job opportunities can
shape social skills and create demand for education and
training. Learning on the job leads to significantly higher

	

earnings in many settings, with the return to one year of
work experience being around a third to half of the return
to an additional year of schooling.
A targeted investment climate? The conventional wisdom is
that a level playing field is preferable because governments
do not have enough information to pick winners and targeting can be c­ aptured by interest groups. But given the
often limited fiscal space and administrative capacity of
developing countries, creating an enabling business environment across the board can be challenging, and the relevant question is how policy priorities should be set. The
conventional wisdom views targeting with a skepticism
that stems from failed experiences with industrial policy.
However, targeting may not necessarily be aimed at industrial sectors. Supporting job creation in sectors with high
rates of female employment, or productivity gains in smallholder farming, or more jobs connected to global value
chains may have high development payoffs depending on
country contexts.
When there is clarity about where the good jobs for development are, and there is sufficient information to understand what can be done to support the creation of those jobs,
a targeted investment climate may be warranted. But this is
provided that targeted interventions can be designed in a way
that makes them resilient to ­capture by interest groups. The
risk of capture is easier to contain when the number of
­beneficiaries is very large, such as the case of farmers, urban
businesses, and female micro-entrepreneurs. It is much
higher in the case of industrial policy.
Competing for jobs? The conventional wisdom is that the number of jobs is not finite, so that policies for jobs in one country
cannot be harmful to other countries. Indeed, in the medium
to long term, total employment is roughly determined by the
size of the labor force. But policies may alter global trade,
investment, and migration flows, affecting the composition of
employment. The concern is that the share of good jobs for
development may decline in one country as it increases in
another. Policies aimed at capturing a larger global share of
the jobs with the largest productive spillovers can reduce wellbeing abroad, even if global well-being increases.
However, not all efforts to support job creation amount to
beggar-thy-neighbor policies. Whether they do so depends on
the type of instruments used and the nature of the spillovers
from jobs. A key question is what purpose policies serve. Policies that aim to improve compliance with rights, prosecuting
forced labor and harmful forms of child labor, amount to
providing a global public good. On the other hand, policies
that aim at reaping the benefits from productive externalities
may adversely affect other countries, especially when they
undermine an open trading system and are not aligned with a
country’s dynamic comparative advantage.

Protecting workers or protecting jobs? The conventional wisdom is that policies that protect people are preferable, because
they mitigate welfare losses while at the same time allowing
the reallocation of labor, hence supporting creative destruction. Protecting jobs that are no longer economically viable
through government transfers and employment protection
legislation freezes an inefficient allocation of resources. Protecting jobs also entails a high risk of capture. It may lead to
enduringly unproductive jobs, stifle technological advance,
prevent structural change, and eventually undermine growth.
However, there are times when many jobs are lost or
threatened at once and few are being created. There are also
jobs generating substantial productivity spillovers, whose
disappearance in large numbers can lead to ghost towns and
depressed regions. Protecting people should have primacy if
shocks are idiosyncratic—if the employment dislocation is
local and limited and if turnover continues to be the norm.
Protecting jobs may be warranted in times of systemic crises
or major economic restructuring. But job protection policies
can create permanent inefficiency, especially in countries
with weak institutions, making it indispensable to establish
and enforce trigger rules and sunset clauses that define the
extent and size of the protection.
How to accelerate the reallocation of workers? The conventional wisdom is to focus policy on removing the labor
market rigidities that keep workers in firms or areas with
low productivity. But reforms may not always be politically
feasible. In India, complex and cumbersome labor market
institutions have unambiguously negative effects on economic efficiency but these institutions have remained largely
untouched for 60 years.
Tolerance for the avoidance or evasion of distortive regulation can help contain their cost but not ensure dynamism.
In India, widespread noncompliance has been the dominant
response to cumbersome labor regulations. However, laborintensive manufacturing sectors remain sluggish despite
buoyant performance of the overall economy. Other countries with similarly stringent regulatory obstacles have
accomplished more efficiency-enhancing labor reallocation
by actively taking advantage of productivity spillovers from
jobs in industrial clusters, dynamic cities, or global value
chains to make the regulations less binding. In Sri Lanka,
the development of export processing zones (EPZs) drove
the takeoff of the garment industry. In Brazil, the surge of
internal migration is closely associated with the country’s
continuing integration into the global economy and a development policy that favors clusters and agglomeration. In
China, labor reallocation is rooted in the development of
competitive cities, supported by regional competition and
experimentation. A strategic focus on enhancing productivity spillovers from jobs, through urbanization and global
integration, can overcome the labor rigidity.

The jobs challenge
Demographic transitions, structural change, technological progress, and
global volatility are changing the world of work. Yet, traditional farming
and self-employment remain dominant in many countries.

W

orldwide, more than 3 billion people
have jobs, but the nature of their jobs
varies greatly. Some 1.65 billion have
regular wages or salaries. Another 1.5 billion
work in farming and small household enterprises,
or in casual or seasonal day labor. The majority
of workers in the poorest countries are engaged
in these types of work, outside the scope of an
employer-employee relationship. Another 200
million people, a disproportionate share of them
youth, are unemployed and actively looking for
work. Almost 2 billion working-age adults are
neither working nor look­
ing for work; the
majority of these are women, and an unknown
number are eager to have a job.1
The jobs challenge facing the world is multifaceted, ranging from improving aspects of the
work people do, to supporting the reallocation
of people to better jobs, to creating jobs for
those who want to work. Youth bulges in some
countries are bringing in millions of new job
seekers. Sub-Saharan Africa’s labor force grows
by about 8 million people every year. South
Asia’s grows by 1 million people every month.
Elsewhere, the working population is rapidly aging, and more and more workers are putting off
retirement. By 2020, more than 40 million additional jobs will be needed for people 65 years
and older.2
Structural and technological changes are
moving more people from rural areas to cities.

In the next 15 years, half of the population in
developing countries will reside in urban areas,
the result of a migration that is rapidly shifting
work from the farm to the factory or the street.
The rural-urban shift generally improves individual well-being, especially for those who find
wage employment. Still, workers’ share of global
income may be declining, a pattern attributed in
part to globalization and technological change.
Wages for the same occupation are converging
across countries, but a higher premium is paid
for more skilled occupations. Women’s earnings
still lag behind those of men, and the fraction of
them who work varies enormously across countries. While women’s labor force participation
exceeds 75 percent in Vietnam, it is only 28 percent in Pakistan.
As the world changes, so do jobs. Despite improvements in workers’ education levels, many
firms report that they have difficulty finding the
skilled workers they seek. Part-time and temporary work appear to be increasing. In India and
South Africa, for example, there has been a
sharp rise in the number of temporary employment services and labor brokers. Outsourcing
was once concentrated in manufacturing, but
new technology is now enabling the splintering
of tasks in services. Meanwhile, new platforms
on the internet and mobile phones offer innovations for matching workers and employers, and
not only for highly skilled jobs.

	

A job, but not always a salary
To many, the word job brings to mind a worker
with an employer and a regular paycheck. Yet,
this narrow definition excludes nearly 1.5 billion
people who work for a living. The concept of a
job is actually much broader than wage employment. Jobs are activities that generate actual or
imputed income, monetary or in kind, formal or
informal. But not all forms of work can be
deemed jobs. Activities performed against the
will of the worker or involving violations of fundamental human rights should not be considered jobs. Some other activities that entail work
effort, such as cooking and cleaning at home, are
not considered jobs unless they are performed by
people hired and paid for the work.

Multiple forms of work
Defining and measuring jobs is challenging because the ways people spend their time and work
are diverse (question 1). Economists usually distinguish between work and leisure, but the reality is more complex. Time can be allocated to
nonproduction and production activities. The
first category includes time spent eating, sleeping, schooling, and at recreation. Production includes both market and nonmarket work.
Whether an activity is considered production
can be assessed based on a third-person test: “if
an activity is of such character that it might be
delegated to a paid worker, then that activity
shall be deemed productive.”3
Patterns in time allocated to production differ across countries and over time. Jobs that
span eight hours a day, five days a week, with
paid vacation, are not the norm in developing
countries. Some jobs involve a few hours of
work during certain days of the week or certain
weeks of the year; others entail long hours most
days of the week almost every week of the year.
Some people have had only one job in the pre­
vious week, while others have engaged in two
or more jobs. In 2011, temporary employment
represented more than one-fifth of total wage
employment in the Republic of Korea and Spain,
but around 5 percent in Australia and the Slovak
Republic.4
The measurement of unemployment or underemployment is equally challenging. Some

The jobs challenge   49

people would like to work more hours, whereas
others would rather not. More than 15 percent
of those employed in Armenia, Colombia, Guatemala, and Peru, but less than 3 percent in
Hungary, Pakistan, Portugal, and the United
States worked fewer hours than desired.5 Some
people who would like to work have no job.
Unemployment rates vary over the business cycle; around 2009 and 2010, when the worst of
the international crisis hit most countries in
the world, they ranged from more than 20 percent in South Africa and Spain to less than 5 percent in Austria, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri
Lanka, and Thailand.6
The world of work is more diverse in developing countries than in developed countries.
This diversity refers not only to the number of
hours worked and number of jobs available,
usual yardsticks in developed countries, but
also to characteristics of jobs. Two main aspects
stand out. First, there is prevalence of selfemployment, which often makes measures of
unemployment and underemployment inadequate.7 Second, the coexistence of traditional
and modern modes of production leads to
large variations in the nature of work, from
subsistence agriculture and menial work to
technology-driven manufacturing and services.
Work across the developing world is characterized by a high prevalence of informality,
whether defined on the basis of firm registration, social security coverage, or a written employment contract. Informal employment is
not under the purview of labor regulations, either because of their limited scope or because
they are deliberately avoided or evaded. Regardless of the specific definition used, informal employment is generally associated with
lower productivity. However, this does not necessarily mean that firm registration, social security coverage, or a written contract would result
in greater efficiency. Informality can be a symptom of lower productivity as much as it can be
a cause of it.

Different places, different jobs
Self-employment and farming represent almost
half the jobs in the developing world. The vast
majority of those in self-employment work
in small enterprises with no paid employees.8

But shares of wage work, farming, and selfemployment differ greatly by gender and across
countries. Nonwage work represents more
than 80 percent of women’s employment in
Sub-Saharan Africa, but less than 20 percent in
countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia
(figure 1.1).
Gender differences are also striking.9 Worldwide, less than 50 percent of women have jobs,
whereas almost 80 percent of men do. Roughly
50 percent of both working men and working
women are wage earners, but this statistic hides
substantial variation across countries and regions. Women are significantly underrepresented in wage employment in low- and lowermiddle-income countries, but are more likely
than men to work for wages in middle-income
countries. In countries such as Pakistan, where
28 percent of women but more than 82 percent
of men participate in the labor force, wage employment is a much lower share of total employment among women than among men. Even in
countries such as Tanzania and Vietnam, where
participation rates are above 75 percent for both
men and women, wage employment still lags
behind for women. Beyond these stark contrasts, women continue to earn significantly less
than men. And these differences are not fully

explained by education, experience, or sector of
work.
A growing share of youth, typically defined
as people ages 15 to 24, is in schooling or in
training. Still, youth unemployment reaches
alarming levels in some countries (above 40 percent in South Africa since early 2008 and above
50 percent in Spain in early 2012).10 Even in
countries where it is relatively low, the youth unemployment rate is twice or more the national
average. In addition, a large share of young people are considered “idle”—not in education, not
employed, and not in training or looking for
work (figure 1.2).11 In some countries, more
than one-third of 15- to 24-year-olds are idle; in
most countries, unemployment rates are small
compared to idleness rates.12 In many cases,
when youth work they do so in unpaid jobs. If
paid, they are less likely to have access to social
security.13
Although child labor is in decline, it still affects 1 in 8 children (1 in 14 in the case of hazardous work). The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines child labor as any work
by a child under age 12 or, for a child above
age 12, any work that impedes education or is
damaging to health and personal development.
Worldwide, 306 million children were at work in

	

2008. Of these, 215 million were engaged in activities that constituted child labor, and 115 million were involved in hazardous work.14 Most of
these children are unpaid family workers or participate in farming. More than half live in Asia
and the Pacific; but the share is highest is in SubSaharan Africa, where child labor affects 1 in 4
children (or 65 million of them).

Youth bulges, aging societies,
and migrant nations
Demographic shifts can be massive, but they do
not always go in the same direction. The most
populous countries in the world have experienced very large increases in their labor force:
nearly 8 million new entrants a year in China
and 7 million a year in India since the early
1990s. (These rates are now decelerating rapidly,
particularly in China.) Many smaller countries
face large relative increases, even if the absolute
numbers are less astounding. In other countries,
the overall population and the labor force are
shrinking. For example, Ukraine’s labor force is
estimated to decrease by 0.75 percent annually,
the equivalent of approximately 160,000 fewer
people every year.15
A simple conceptual exercise illustrates the
challenges raised by these dramatic demographic
transitions. To keep the ratio of employment to
working-age population constant, in 2020, there
should be around 600 million more jobs than in
2005. More than 175 million of them, or nearly
1 million a month, would be needed in East Asia
and the Pacific as well as in South Asia (figure
1.3). The number of jobs in Sub-Saharan Africa
would have to increase by about 50 percent,
which translates into employment growth of 2.7
percent a year. But in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where populations are aging, only 2.4
million new jobs would be needed during the
same period.
The age structure of the labor force, not simply its size, matters as well. Youth are staying in
school longer and entering the labor market
later, whereas adults are living longer and
healthier lives. The labor force participation rate
of people 65 years of age and older has remained
relatively stable over the past two decades. Even
with a stable participation rate, however, close to

42 million jobs will have to be generated by 2020
to cope with the growth in the number of older
people. One-quarter of these jobs will need to be
in China, even though the size of the Chinese
labor force will have started to decline in absolute terms.16
International migration is also changing the
size and composition of the labor force in many
countries. At the turn of the century, there were
more than 200 million international migrants
worldwide, and nearly 90 million of them were
workers. If international migrants constituted a
nation, theirs would be the fifth-largest in the
world, ahead of Brazil. Precise estimates diverge
but there is agreement that migrants represent
nearly 3 percent of the world population.17
These aggregate figures hide important differences across countries. Some are large migration recipients either in absolute numbers (for
instance, the United States) or in relative terms

(Jordan and Singapore). Migrants from countries such as Bangladesh, India, and Mexico represent a large share of total migrants worldwide;
countries such as Fiji, Jamaica, and Tonga have a
large share of their population overseas. Figures
for some of the smaller countries are striking.
For instance, nearly one-fifth of all Salvadorians
live abroad, while more than three-fifths of the
population in Kuwait, Qatar, and the United
Arab Emirates is foreign-born.18

Cities, wages, and women
Economic development brings significant
changes in the composition of the labor force, a
process known as structural transformation.19
Before 2020, more than half of the total population in developing countries is expected to be
living in cities and towns.20 That means that the
growth of the nonagricultural labor force will
vastly exceed the growth of the agricultural labor force.21 Urbanization derives from growth
in agricultural productivity that sustains higher
standards of living. It can also be associated
with rapid economic growth at the aggregate
level, because urban jobs tend to be more productive than rural jobs. But that has not always

been the case.22 Population movements away
from agriculture were indeed associated with
rapid economic growth in East Asia; much less
so in Sub-Saharan Africa (figure 1.4).
Technological change induces families to increase market production in place of home production.23 Structural change has increased the
time devoted to consumption or investment
activities but it has also meant more work. In
some cases, structural change has even led to
­reduced leisure,24 particularly for workers who
shift to market jobs with low productivity.25 In
the past, this process of structural change often
took decades, but in many developing countries, it is transforming lives within a generation
(box 1.1).
The shift from home to market production is
not gender neutral, because women have tended
to specialize in home production whereas men
traditionally have focused more on market production. As women move into jobs, they often
continue to work at home. When both jobs and
home activities are considered, women are generally busier than men. This is so in rich and
poor countries. Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and India shows that women spend
more time on production activities than men
do.26 But when they take on jobs—especially

nature of work and leisure change as cities develop

The process of structural transformation can be seen today in small
and medium-size cities throughout the developing world. The process has been so fast that most people, even young ones, remember the old rural setting. As they have embraced the traits of modern urban life, their jobs and their leisure have changed so much
that they do not contemplate returning to the old mores.
A neighborhood of 5,000 outside the city of Tangerang, Indonesia, started coming to life 25 years ago, when iron, rubber, garment,
and thread factories sprang up in the surrounding areas. Some in
the neighborhood still work as farmhands. But most women and
men earn their living in the factories, as well as in a variety of jobs
that rose up alongside them. Many men drive ojeks (motorcycle
taxis); women sell sweets and other items by the gates of the factories. Residents also make a living through home-based garment
piecework, handicrafts such as broom-making, and construction
work; some are civil servants and teachers. Poorer women collect
and resell scraps of fabric. The flow of newcomers has also offered
an income-generating opportunity to local families from renting
rooms for lodging. Seemingly everyone in the neighborhood has a
cell phone and gets around on their own motorcycle.
A 28-year-old steelworker and father of one said that getting
factory work used to be a lot easier when the community was
newer. Junior high school graduates were still accepted for work
then. Now, he said, production workers must have at least a senior
high school degree, and vocational school graduates under age 30

are preferred. Practices surrounding recruitment have also become
tighter. “It is public knowledge,” he added, “that to be accepted in
the company, candidates must have an inside connection because
more and more people need work, while the number of job opportunities is limited.” Many factory workers in the neighborhood
work on a six-month contract and hope for its renewal. The best
local job available is often reported to be running one’s own business. Even when faced with possible unemployment, a 41-year-old
noted he had “never thought of returning to the village. That is
desperate. Don’t be desperate. Find another job and don’t get
picky.”
Comparing the situation now to the early days, a local official
described the neighborhood’s busy market as “cleaner and more
strategic now, and there are more sellers or merchants, so there are
more options. Public transportation to the market is more accessible
now. It used to be hard to find, and the streets used to be muddy.”
He estimated that poverty in the neighborhood had fallen by half,
from 20 percent at the turn of the century to around 10 percent now.
He indicated that the neighborhood had weathered the global
financial crisis well and that factory workers had been able to keep
their jobs. These changes to work come with changes in leisure.
Young men now spend time on computer chats and playing video
games. “We used to send letters through the post office,” recalls
a 22-year-old. “Now, nobody wants to go to the post office. . . .
It’s beneath them. Now everyone has cell phones.”

bring earnings opportunities to women, but also new difficulties

Jobs can transform women’s roles in households and in society
more broadly. In a community of 3,000 inhabitants outside Durban,
South Africa, 80 percent of the women were estimated to be working outside their home, mainly as teachers and nurses but also in
offices and retail outlets or with the police. Women did not have
such opportunities 10 years ago. “Women are no longer regarded
as housewives,” a young woman remarked in a Durban focus
group.
In a bustling neighborhood in East Jakarta, in Indonesia, women
work as street sellers, peddling food, glasses, plates, and carpets.
Young women explained that selling carpets is hard work that
women do “because they have to help support their families. Their
husbands’ jobs don’t generate enough income.” With more education than their elders, young women in this area of Jakarta are more
likely to be working in the nearby ceramic factory or in one of the
shops or beauty salons in the neighborhood’s markets or at the new
shopping malls in the city.
In a poor neighborhood of Santiago de los Caballeros, the
second-largest city in the Dominican Republic, only a few women
sold clothes and sweets in the streets a decade ago. Many are now
earning incomes from activities such as selling lottery tickets or running small clothing stores and beauty salons. The incomes of these
women are vitally important to their families because men are
struggling. Factory opportunities and other jobs associated with
the city’s free trade zone have been shrinking in recent years. Participants in a Santiago focus group said that women found work

more easily than men because employers have “more confidence in
them [the women].”
Increased labor force participation is not without challenges.
The women in Santiago worry about their safety because of assaults,
theft, and gang violence; many think it is too dangerous to work at
night. Despite the expansion of work opportunities, mobility continues to be a constraint not only because of poor transportation
and safety risks but also because of the roles women play as incomeearners and as caregivers in the household. In rural areas, women
face difficulties in traveling for farm work and other jobs outside
their villages because of traditional cultural and gender norms.
In a semi-urban area outside Cuzco, in Peru, large numbers of
women are now engaged in home-based handicrafts, sewing, and
diverse agricultural activities. Outside the home, they take up farm
jobs, run their own small shops or restaurants, or work for hire in
these places. The women explained, however, that they consider
home-based activities (such as raising livestock) to be better jobs
than jobs outside the home, because “it’s peaceful work, and we can
look after the kids.”
Women encounter many difficulties in commuting across cities
for work. In Lautoka, an urban area in Fiji, the local economy is stagnant, and women are working in much larger numbers to help their
households cope. Focus group participants explained that only men
“can take up jobs in a different town . . . but not the wife because
she has responsibilities at home to look after the kids and in-laws.”

those that are outside the household setting—
their economic role changes (box 1.2).

Jobs are changing in surprising ways
New technologies, globalization, and structural
transformation have brought about remarkable
improvements in efficiency. Some developing
countries have managed to narrow the productivity gap with industrial countries in only a few
decades.27 But others have failed to catch up and
the gap remains considerable for all de­veloping
regions (figure 1.5).
The nature of work is changing as well.
Industrial countries are experiencing a sustained shift away from primary and traditional
manufacturing industries toward services and
knowledge-intensive jobs. At the same time,
technology improvements and greater reliance
on outsourcing to developing countries is leading to a decline in middle-skilled jobs.28 Technology has allowed production tasks to be splintered
and therefore performed in different locations.29

Transnational companies have built integrated
value chains and can tap into national skill pools
around the world.30 Outsourcing is occurring in
services as well as manufacturing. The share of
developing countries in exports of world services
rose from 11 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in
2008.31 India has led the way in the information
technology (IT) sector, but other countries, such
as the Arab Republic of Egypt, have begun to focus attention on exporting services.32
This changing landscape of global production has also brought about shifts in skills endowments and in the distribution of top talent
across countries. India and China rank high in
perceived attractiveness as hubs of outsourcing
because of their exceptionally high ratings in
people skills and availability.33 India has close to
20 million students in higher education, nearly
as many as the United States; both countries are
outpaced by China, with 30 million postsecondary students.34 The United States still accounts
for a large share of international top scorers in
student assessments, but Korea has the same
share as Germany, and both are closely followed

alone is one-fifth of that of G
­ ermany and about
double that of Argentina.35
Skills are not one-dimensional, however. Different jobs require different combinations of
manual skills (needed for physical tasks), cognitive skills (needed for mental tasks), and social
skills (needed to interact with others). The distribution of employment by occupation can be
used to estimate the skill intensity of production. As incomes rise, countries tend to use fewer
manual skills in production, and more nonroutine cognitive skills. 36 However, even for a given
level of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, countries can use nonroutine skills to varying degrees (figure 1.6).37
Technological progress expands the possibilities for emerging and even low-income countries to create jobs in higher-skilled production
activities as well as to link to international value
chains in services and manufacturing. In other
words, technological progress enables countries
to diverge from a linear evolutionary path from
manual skill intensity to the use of higher-order
cognitive and social skills.38 India and China top
the list of countries in an index measuring their

a­ ttractiveness as hubs for the outsourcing of services. Ghana and Senegal, ranked 26th and 28th,
come in significantly ahead of emerging market
powerhouses like South Africa or Turkey.39
High-skilled niches are developing the world
over. They tend to be ­located in close proximity

Technology itself is changing the way workers and firms connect, through their access to
much larger, even global, marketplaces for employment. Some of these marketplaces operate
through the Internet; others use mobile phone
technology.41 These changes are affecting workers in developing countries and not just those in
high-skilled occupations. Babajobs, for example,
was launched in 2009 and is now the largest
digital marketplace for blue-collar jobs in India,
with more than 320,000 job listings and more
than 80,000 job seekers.

less common. Part-time and temporary wage
employment (also called nonstandard employment) is now a major feature of industrial countries. More than half the firms in the United
States expect to raise the share of their part-time
and temporary employees over the next five
years.42 The trend is also evident in developing
countries (box 1.3).
People’s jobs may not match their aspirations.
Surveys in high-income countries show that as
many as half of all workers—among both selfemployed and wage employees—would prefer
to be their own bosses.43 Percentages are lower
in low- and middle-income countries, where
a larger fraction of the labor force works in
household enterprises or on farms. On average,
about one-fourth of adults from 35 countries in
Eastern Europe and Central Asia prefer selfemployment, but the rate varies from 10 percent
in Azerbaijan and Hungary to 43 percent in
Belarus and Turkey.44 In poorer countries, selfemployment is often a choice of last resort, in
part because of the inability to find salaried employment.45 Owning a small business is a goal to
which the poor do not always aspire.46

Prosperity, but a changing
distribution of earnings
Earnings from work increase with economic development, and the benefits associated with jobs
improve as well (figure 1.7). The relationship is
not mechanical, but growth is unambiguously
good for jobs. Part of the change in earnings and
benefits stems from the higher average skills that
economies gain as they become more developed; part comes from workers with the same
skills enjoying better opportunities.
Poverty has declined in the developing world,
to a large extent through jobs. The share of the
population of the developing world living on
less than US$1.25 a day (in purchasing power
parity, or PPP) fell from 52 percent in 1981 to 22
percent in 2008, or from 1.94 billion to 1.29 billion people.47 This reduction is the result of
multiple factors, but the creation of millions of
new, more productive jobs, mostly in Asia but
also in other parts of the developing world, has
been the main driving force.48 More people have
jobs now than ever before, and those jobs provide generally higher earnings.

BOX 1.3  T he

temporary staffing industry is growing in developing countries

A decade ago, the temporary staffing industry was seen as irrelevant outside of high-income countries. But it is now growing rapidly
in some developing countries, even beyond large cities.a This
growth is often viewed as a response to the complex regulatory
framework facing employers. Temporary staffing also allows more
flexibility in the management of peak workloads and in adjusting
staffing levels up or down in line with business demands.
Depending on the context, the temporary staffing industry
employs different types of workers, from mainly entry-level, previously unemployed workers seeking to gain experience to highly educated, mid-level career employees looking to fast-track their careers.
In South Africa, temporary workers make up about 7 percent of
the labor force; the temporary staffing industry provides employment to an average of 410,000 workers a day.b Finance—the sector in
the statistics that includes temporary staffing—was a close second
to retail in employment growth from 1994 to 2009. Unskilled jobs
and service-related occupations dominate the employment distribution within the labor brokering subsector. A worker employed in
temporary staffing services is less likely to contribute to pension
funds or health insurance and is generally seen as more vulnerable.
Temporary forms of employment have existed in India for
decades, partly as a way to circumvent rigid labor laws.c However,

the modern industry of temporary staffing is only 15 years old,
and is developing rapidly. The number of temporary workers
recruited by labor brokers grew more than 10 percent in 2009 and
18 percent in 2010. According to some media reports, workers are
quitting permanent jobs to move into more attractive temporary
roles. Some firms claim that as many as 15 percent of new recruits
are permanent employees switching to temporary jobs.d Competition in the Indian temporary staffing industry is strong. Agencies
have introduced lower recruitment fees to gain more market share
and to drive growth. Large temporary staffing firms are entering
niche activities such as business consulting (Manpower) and training (TeamLease).e
As temporary staffing grows, so do calls to examine the regulatory framework of the industry.f Some of those calls focus on
addressing vulnerability. Workers in these jobs typically face lower
earnings (because a portion of the pay is diverted to temporary
staffing agencies). They also face a lack of benefits, coverage by
labor laws, and job security. Other efforts focus on professionalizing
the industry. For instance, in 2011 TeamLease and seven other staffing firms formed the Indian Staffing Federation to advocate for
changes in labor laws and more acceptance for the industry in a
country where a vast majority of the labor force is unorganized.

Yet in a majority of countries, both industrial and developing, the share of labor in total
income is declining.49 This trend, which has
been observed since the mid-1980s and early
1990s, has been attributed to various forces,
from technological progress biased toward
skilled workers to global competition undermining workers’ bargaining power. The entrance of China and India in world trade has
doubled the size of the globalized labor force,
hence reducing the price of labor relative to that
of other factors of production.50
Changes in the distribution of income in
recent years have actually taken place not only
between factors of production but between
workers. Two distinctions are relevant in this respect: between high- and low-skill workers, and
between those who work in tradable sectors and
those who do not. Tradable sectors produce
goods and services that can be exported or imported, such as shirts or computers. A turning
point came in the mid-1990s, when labor earnings in developing countries started to grow
faster than those in industrial countries, regardless of level of skill. But the trend is more pronounced in tradable sectors, whereas low-skill
workers in nontradable sectors continue to be
the most disadvantaged (figure 1.8).
The relatively lower wages among low-skill
workers compared with high-skill workers, particularly in nontradable sectors in developing
countries, are consistent with an increase in returns to education. Returns to education measure the wage premium on higher educational
attainment for workers of the same sex with the
same age and work experience. In all regions,
more schooling is associated with higher labor
earnings, but the gain is not linear. The labor
earnings of workers with tertiary education are
double or more than those of workers with secondary education only. However, workers with
only a secondary education earn little more than
those with elementary education. The education
premium is generally higher the lower the income level of the country (figure 1.9).

The role of the private sector
The solution to all these demographic and
technological challenges rests with the private
sector. That does not mean that the government

does not have a role to play. The quality of the
civil service is critically important for development, whether it is teachers building skills, agricultural extension agents improving agricultural productivity, or urban planners designing
functional cities. Public works programs or employment programs for the demobilization of
combatants are also justified in some circumstances. But the private sector is the main engine of job creation and the source of roughly
nine of 10 jobs in the world. Between 1995 and
2005, the private sector accounted for almost 90
percent of jobs created in Brazil. In the Philippines and Turkey, the fraction reached 95
percent.51
But the most remarkable example of the
expansion of employment through private
sector growth is the case of China. In 1981,
private sector employment accounted for 2.3
million workers while state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) had 80 million workers. Two decades
later, employment in private sector firms accounted for 74.7 million workers surpassing,
for the first time, the 74.6 million workers in
SOEs (figure 1.10).52
In contrast to the global average, in some
countries in the Middle East and North Africa,
the state keeps a leading role as an employer—a
pattern that can be linked to the political economy of the post-independence period and, in
some cases, to the abundance of oil revenues.53
For a long period, public sector jobs were offered to young college graduates. In recent years,
however, the fiscal space for continued expansion in public sector employment shrank, and
“queuing” for public sector jobs became more
prevalent, leading to increasing transitions into
informality, a devaluation of education credentials, and forms of social exclusion.54 A relatively
well-educated and young labor force remains
unemployed, or underemployed, and labor productivity stagnates.55

Vulnerability on a global scale
Jobs are vulnerable to economic downturns—
and much more so in the private than in the
public sector. Short-term crises may wipe out
years of progress. They may start in a single
country and through globalization spread over
entire regions or, as in the recent one, to the

2011 had not yet returned to its pre-crisis level.57
As Europe struggles with high levels of public
debt, vulnerabilities in its banking sector, and
uncertainties about the euro, and as growth decelerates in China and India, it is by no means
clear that the global crisis is over.
The impact of the 2008–09 crisis varied
across developing countries. Some, such as the
Baltic countries, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mexico,
Romania, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey, had
absolute declines in employment; other countries such as Brazil, China, and Indonesia experienced only a brief deceleration. Country-­
specific studies shed further light on employment
impacts across different population groups. For
example, it is estimated that the crisis cost China
between 20 million and 36 million jobs, particularly among migrant workers in export-oriented
sectors.58 In Mexico, it caused a decline of half a
­million jobs between 2008 and the second quarter of 2009, particularly among women, youth,
and older workers, as well as a 10 percent drop
in real wages.59 In Indonesia, although the effects of the crisis were mild, young, casual, and
informal workers were affected.60 Across countries, the young bore the largest brunt.61
Adjustment patterns, in terms of jobs lost or
earnings declines, also varied in developing

countries. The less formalized the labor market,
the more earnings shrank and the less employment numbers gave away. In Central and Eastern Europe, where the labor market is largely
formalized, the growth rate of GDP dropped on
average by 12 percentage points, employment
contracted by 3 percent, and earnings fell by
more than 8 percent (figure 1.11).62 In East Asia,
where formal employment rates are very low,
the average decline in GDP growth was 5.5 percentage points and total employment numbers
barely changed.63
The policy response to the crisis was unprecedented in its scale, but it also involved different
combinations of instruments, with potentially
different implications for jobs. Fiscal stimulus
across the world amounted to US$5.5 trillion
in purchasing power parity, with China, Japan,
and the United States accounting for more than
70 percent of it.64 Of 77 countries for which
data are available, 80 percent used fiscal expansion. Higher-income countries favored tax
cuts, higher unemployment benefits, and direct support for enterprises. Low- and middleincome countries boosted expenditures, including spending on training and income-support
measures.65 Across countries, responses mainly
aimed at preventing or mitigating employment

BOX 1.4 

Responses to the crisis went beyond income support for the unemployed

Countries worldwide used an array of policy responses to confront
the jobs crisis. Macroeconomic stimulus and targeted sector policies
were supplemented by policies to strengthen income support for
those affected; measures to boost labor demand through wage
subsidies, credit policies, and public works programs; and investments in skills and tailor-made employment services for those most
affected.
Globally, unemployment insurance played a minor role. Only
15.4 percent of the unemployed received benefits during the crisis,
because of the low effective coverage of unemployment insurance
programs. In 23 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Central Europe, and Latin America, the
duration of benefits was extended. Countries with large informal
sectors or without unemployment schemes relied on a mix of cash
transfers and public works schemes to provide additional income
support for those in need. Colombia’s Familias en Acción—a program focusing on strengthening nutrition and education for children—increased its coverage from 1.8 million to 2.7 million families.
Argentina expanded the coverage of family benefits to all informal
sector workers.
Countries across all income levels took measures to boost labor
demand. Of the resources devoted to creating and protecting jobs,
high-income countries spent more than half (56 percent) on credit
policies for firms. They also implemented work-sharing arrangements to cushion the impact of the crisis. Take-up rates for these

initiatives reached 3.3 percent of the employed in Italy, 3.2 percent
in Germany, and 2.7 percent in Japan.
Low- and middle-income countries spent 67 percent of their
resources on direct job creation measures and public works programs. Mexico, for example, extended its temporary works program
to around 250,000 workers, or 0.5 percent of the labor force. Wage
subsides were popular in Europe. They were most often implemented through a reduction in social security contributions and
were targeted to small and medium enterprises or to disadvantaged
groups such as long-term job seekers and the young. To reach an
effective scale in a timely manner, though, countries needed to have
had such programs in place before the crisis.
In comparison, efforts to ramp up training, employment services, or specific support programs for vulnerable groups were relatively modest in scope and scale. Building or maintaining skills took
the lion’s share of the budget in this category, with Chile, Italy, Mexico, Turkey, and the United States spending the most.
Overall, countries with more mature social protection systems as
well as established employment programs were able to respond
quickly and reduce the impact of the crisis on jobs. With few exceptions, though, little is known about possible unintended effects of
their programs such as whether preserving some jobs came at the
expense of destroying others. Careful impact analysis is only in its
initial stages.

losses, rather than trying to offset earnings
shortfalls (box 1.4).

Demography, urbanization, globalization, technological progress, and macroeconomic crises
bring about formidable jobs challenges. Countries that fail to address them may fall into vicious circles of slow growth in labor earnings and
job-related dis­satisfaction affecting a sizable por-

tion of the labor force.66 Youth unemployment
and idleness may be high, and women may face
limited job ­opportunities, leaving potential economic and social gains untapped.67 A repeating
pattern of small gains in living standards, slow
productivity growth, and eroding social cohesion may emerge. In contrast, countries that successfully address these job challenges can develop
­virtuous circles. The results—prosperous populations, a growing middle class, increased productivity, and improved opportunities for women
and youth—may then be self-reinforcing.

QUESTION

1

What is a job?

The world of work is diverse, especially in developing countries, and it is changing rapidly.
Against this backdrop, the diversity of the words
used to describe what people do to earn a living
across countries and cultures should not be surprising. Even people who speak the same language can have vastly different interpretations
of the meaning of a job. For some, the word
conjures up an image of a worker in an office
or a factory, with an employer and a regular
paycheck. Others may think of farmers, selfemployed vendors in cities, and caregivers of
children or elderly relatives.

Work matters and words matter
The varied interpretations capture the different
aspects of jobs that people value. A woman in
Hanoi, Vietnam, explained, “an old woman who
just sells vegetables can gain respect from others
and people listen to her.”68 A man who had
worked his way out of poverty in Satgailijhara,
Bangladesh, linked the value of his job as a rice
farmer to being able to invest in his children, “I
have been able to get my children educated.
That’s the best achievement in life.”69
Ela Bhatt, a lawyer and the founder of Self
Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in India, described her struggle with the language of
work, given the multiplicity of tasks that people
do every day and over time: “A small farmer
works on her own farm. In tough times, she also
works on other farms as a laborer. When the agriculture season is over, she goes to the forest to
collect gum and other forest produce. Year
round, she produces embroidered items either at
a piece rate for a contractor or for sale to a trader
who comes to her village to buy goods. Now,
how should her trade be categorized? Does she
belong to the agricultural sector, the factory sector, or the home-based work sector? Should she
be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker? Is
she self-employed or is she a piece-rate worker?”70
These questions are not merely semantic.
The words and categories that are used to describe work have tangible implications. Views

on what a job is and what it means almost inevitably influence views on what policies for jobs
should look like. Those for whom the word job
is associated with the image of a worker in an
office or a factory, with an e­ mployer and a paycheck, may focus on a supportive investment
climate for firms. Those for whom the word also
encompasses farming, street vending, waste
picking, and domestic employment may think
of jobs policies as including land reform, agricultural extension, urban policies, or the provision of voice to the most vulnerable workers.
According to the International Conference of
Labour Statisticians (ICLS), which sets standard
definitions for official use across countries, a job
is “a set of tasks and duties performed, or meant
to be performed, by one person, including for an
employer or in self-employment.”71 Under this
definition, a job is not the same as employment.
The existence of job vacancies and people with
more than one job means that the number of
jobs is greater than the number of people employed. The existence of unemployment means
that people do not find the jobs they want. Jobs
refer to tasks, while the wage employed, farmers,
and the self-employed refer to the people who
do them.

Some gray areas
The ICLS definition excludes some forms of
work from official employment statistics. The
employed are part of the economically active
population, defined as people who contribute to
“the production of goods and services as defined by the United Nations systems of national
accounts and balances.”72 The system of national
accounts (SNA) includes “all production actually destined for the market, whether for sale or
barter,” as well as the production of goods for
one’s own use, but “excludes all production of
services for own final consumption within
households.”73 This definition thus leaves out of
official statistics activities such as child-rearing,
care of the elderly, or home cooking, as well as
traveling to work.

64  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

Some countries are starting to develop estimates of these other types of activities. The
SNA offers guidelines to countries for producing satellite accounts reflecting forms of household work that are not considered jobs. According to these guidelines, “a job can refer
to unpaid household service and volunteer
work performed by one person for a household
outside the SNA production boundary but
within the general production boundary.”74
Mexico, for instance, has used this guidance to
estimate the value of unremunerated activities
in households, such as housekeeping and child
care. These activities represented nearly a quarter of Mexican GDP between 2003 and 2009
and were equivalent to about two-thirds of
worker wages and benefits.75

BOX 1.5 

Informality is another important gray
area. After nearly four decades of debates
about the concept of informality, there is still
no consensus on what is meant by informal
jobs. Some schools of thought link informality
to characteristics of firms—whether the business is registered or pays taxes. Others focus
on characteristics of workers—whether they
are covered by social protection or have an
employment contract. And yet others stress
modes of production and levels of productivity to define informality. A consensus is starting to emerge on how to measure informality,
but the definitions used still leave out types of
work that some consider informal. Meanwhile,
relatively few countries produce regular statistics on informality (box 1.5).

Few countries produce statistics on informality

The concept of dual economies has an old lineage.a Based on the
recognition of dual economies and the Harris and Todaro two-sector
model, the term informality was first coined by a U.K. anthropologist
in a paper about Ghana. The concept gained popularity with a
widely cited report from a mission of the International Labour Organization (ILO) to Kenya.b Since then, studies on informality have proliferated, and the concept has become standard in development
studies, labor economics, and other disciplines. Today the causes
and implications of informality are the subject of an intense academic debate and an extended research agenda aimed at understanding how labor markets function in developing countries.c
A variety of approaches can be used to measure informality,
informal employment, and the informal sector. Measurement be-­
comes even more complex when informality is combined with
other concepts like illegal and underground activities or nonstandard work. The lack of systematic country-level data on informality
has led researchers to construct their own estimates using similar
but not identical criteria, which sometimes lead to diverging
conclusions.
Recommendations on the measurement of informality were first
drafted in 1993 by the 15th International Conference of Labour
­Statisticians (ICLS). Four years later, the United Nations created the
Delhi Group to document and recommend methods for defining
and collecting data on the informal sector. In 2003, the 17th ICLS,
through the document “Guidelines Concerning a Statistical Definition of Informal Employment,” introduced a definition of informal
employment and a series of rules for its measurement. Since 2006,

the Delhi Group has been working with the ILO on a forthcoming
“Manual of Surveys of Informal Employment and Informal Sector.” In
2008, the newest version of the United Nation’s system of national
accounts adopted most of the previous resolutions and recommendations on the measurement of informality. That resulted in a broad
definition that includes both the informal sector and informal
employment. However, gray areas remain in relation to activities
such as farming, independent professionals, and activities among
rural workers in general.
Few countries produce regular official statistics on informality.
The dearth of data is apparent in global repositories such as the
ILO’s Key Indicators of the Labor Market database, which, in its most
recent version, includes data on informality for only 60 countries.d A
report on informality across the world by the ILO and Women in
Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) makes
systematic use of the most thorough definition of informality, covering informal employment and employment in informal firms, to
present data on 47 countries.e The ILO-WIEGO report shows informality rates ranging from 40 percent in Uruguay and 42 percent in
Thailand to 75 percent in Bolivia and 80 percent in India.
The extent of informality varies with differences in productivity
across firms and workers, as well as with differences in the nature of
regulations and the degree to which they are enforced. Whether
informality is the result of exit, exclusion, uneven enforcement, or
low firm productivity is still a matter of debate. Better measurement
can provide information on the magnitude of informality and provide more data for the advancement of studies in this area.

The jobs challenge   

What is not a job?
While views about what a job means vary, a
broad consensus exists on the types of activities
that should never be considered a job. International norms define basic human rights as the
boundaries of what is unacceptable. The United
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which the UN General Assembly embraced
unanimously in 1948, provides for the right to
work and protection from discrimination.76 The
Declaration on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work adopted at the ILO conference in
1998 further specifies core labor standards that
call for an end to forced and compulsory labor,
child labor, and labor discrimination, and that
provide for freedom of association and collective bargaining.77 Most countries have ratified
the conventions on forced labor, child labor, and
discrimination; fewer have ratified the conventions on freedom of association and collective
bargaining (figure 1.12).78
While international agreements help define
what forms of work are unacceptable, in practice many people work in activities that violate
their rights. Some 21 million people are estimated to be subject to forced labor, and around
1 million to trafficking.79 In many cases, forced
labor is inflicted upon minorities or groups that

are discriminated against, such as migrants,
women, and indigenous people. Migrant workers in sweatshops in Latin America, child soldiers in conflict-afflicted areas of Africa, people
trafficked for sexual exploitation in Europe and
Asia, and temporary migrant workers under
sponsorship contracts in the Middle East are
the subjects of the most conspicuous forms of
forced labor and trafficking in the world.
Child labor provides another striking example (box 1.6). Although it is covered by the core
labor standards and many countries have ratified the relevant ILO conventions and the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO
estimates that 115 million children worldwide
were involved in hazardous work in 2008. Measurement is complicated by legal and moral
concerns, as well as by the flawed design of surveys that may induce parents to misreport children’s work.80 These statistics may actually represent only a lower boundary on the size of the
problem.
Recent research shows that children work for
diverse and complex reasons.81 They range from
household poverty to the relative accessibility
and affordability of schooling and from the
preferences of families and even children regarding work and play to the influence of technological change, international trade, and ur-

BOX 1.6 

Not all child work is child labor

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), children engaged in
child labor include “all persons aged between 5 and 17 years who during a
specified time period were engaged in one or more of the following activities:
(a) hazardous work; (b) worst forms of child labor other than hazardous work;
and (c) other forms of child labor (depending on age of the child and weekly
hours worked).”a The “worst forms of child labor” include any work that jeopardizes the health, safety, or morals of a child. Such work is determined to be hazardous depending on its specific nature, the demands on children in particular
industries, and the general working conditions. Apart from hazardous work,
the worst forms of child labor include all forms of slavery, bondage, military
conscription, trafficking, and using, procuring, or offering children for prostitution, pornography, or other illicit activities.
This definition of child labor is governed by two ILO Conventions (132 and
182), two ILO recommendations (146 and 190), and the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child. However, international standards also provide countries
with some latitude in setting allowed boundaries for the involvement of children in productive activities (regarding ages or the definition of hazardous
work, for example). The standards also permit limited work in the performance
of household chores or in light productive activities that are not considered
harmful.

banization. Children in wealthier households
may, in some settings, be engaged in child labor
if household assets and access to finance, land,
or other resources generate more demand for
work from household members.82 Child labor

may affect schooling, health, fertility, and behavior, although establishing these links has been
challenging. Rarely is there a one-to-one tradeoff between school and work. In many places,
the majority of children who work are also attending school. Moreover, a child may have
dropped out of school for reasons unrelated to
child labor. The participation of children 12
years and older in family farming and small
household enterprises can in some cases contribute to the acquisition of skills.83
In sum, jobs are activities that generate actual
income, monetary or in kind, and do not violate
fundamental rights and principles at work.
This definition includes the categories of work
covered by ICLS guidelines: wage or salary employment, employers, members of cooperatives,
family workers (including unpaid family members), and the self-employed. In many instances,
however, these categories may fail to uniquely or
clearly classify certain individuals. For instance,
small farmers are sometimes wage employed or
self-employed, but they may also be employers
if they hire unpaid family workers. Jobs include
labor activities that generate income for the
household, even if no income measure can be attributed to a person’s specific labor, as in the case
of household enterprises and farming.
By this definition, jobs are much broader
than just working in an office or a factory, with
an employer and a regular paycheck.

Jobs are transformational

Introduction to Part 1

E

conomic development is about improvements in living standards supported by
productivity growth. It also involves social change associated with urbanization, integration in the world economy, and the drive
toward gender equality. All of these transformations are related to jobs. The development process is about some jobs becoming better and
others disappearing, about people taking jobs
and changing jobs, and about jobs migrating
to other places within and across countries.
Development often entails the movement of
labor from rural, agricultural, and mostly subsistence activities to urban, nonagricultural, and
mostly market-oriented activities. This movement transforms the lives of families and communities, the organization of firms, and the
norms and values of societies. It can boost productivity and improve living standards and also
affect the cohesiveness of society. Jobs are thus a
key driver of development.

•	

Living standards: Jobs provide earnings opportunities to lift people out of poverty, raise
their consumption, and contribute to individual well-being more broadly.

•	

Productivity: Through job creation and destruction within sectors and reallocations
across sectors and countries, jobs are also at
the root of economic growth.

•	

Social cohesion: Jobs define who people are
in many ways; by shaping values and be­

haviors, they can influence trust and civic
engagement.
Distinguishing these three transformations provides an understanding of how jobs contribute
to development. People’s well-being is the ultimate goal, and the transformation of living
standards captures this link directly. But sustained improvements in living standards are impossible without productivity growth or when
resources are wasted through confrontation.
That is why it is necessary to look at the three
transformations jointly.

Chapter

2
Jobs and living standards
Jobs are the main source of income for the majority of households and a
key driver of poverty reduction. But their contribution to well-being goes
beyond the earnings they provide.

J

obs are the most important determinant
of living standards around the world. For
the vast majority of people, their work is the
main source of income, especially in the poorest
countries. And jobs-related events are the most
frequent reasons for families to escape or fall
into poverty. Furthermore, as earnings increase,
individual choices expand—household members can opt to stay out of the labor force or to
work fewer hours and dedicate more time to
education, retirement, or family. Opportunities
for gainful work, including in farming and
self-employment, offer households the means to
increase consumption and reduce its variability.
Higher crop yields, access to small off-farm enterprise activities, the migration of family members to cities, and transitions to wage employment are milestones on the path to prosperity.
In addition to their fundamental and immediate contribution to earnings, jobs affect other
dimensions of well-being, positively and negatively. Not having a job undermines mental
health, especially in countries where wage employment is the norm and the lack of employment opportunities translates into open unemployment rather than underemployment. But a
job prone to occupational accidents or workrelated diseases can damage physical health or
worse. More generally, monetary, nonmonetary,
and even subjective characteristics of jobs can all
have an impact on well-being (box 2.1).

Jobs also influence how workers see themselves and relate to others. Most people feel that
jobs should be meaningful and contribute to society. Together with other objective job characteristics, the self-esteem a job provides is an important determination of satisfaction with life.

Jobs improve material well-being
Over the course of a country’s development,
higher productivity and labor earnings allow
households to allocate more time to investment and consumption activities and less to
production. Thus, schooling and retirement
gain importance relative to work. For the past
century or so, the number of hours worked by
youth in industrial countries has declined
steadily as access to education has increased.
Similarly, the number of years in retirement
has increased in parallel with longer life expectancy.1 Higher earnings also facilitate longer
periods of job seeking, especially among
younger household members, often leading to
higher unemployment rates. Among men and
women of prime age (25 to 54), total working
hours (market and nonmarket) have remained
relatively stable, with the main change being
the growing share of market activities among
women (figure 2.1). These general trends are
not ironclad, however.

	

Jobs and living standards   

BOX 2.1 

There are many dimensions of living standards and many ways to measure them

Debates on how to define and measure living standards go far back
in social sciences. The work by Rowntree and Booth in late 19th century England is usually mentioned as seminal, especially in relation
to the measurement of poverty. In the 1930s, the creation of the System of National Accounts concentrated on measuring the total market value of the goods and services produced in an economy and
made gross domestic product (GDP) per capita the main indicator
of living standards in general. By the 1970s and 1980s, there was a
growing agreement that important aspects of well-being, such as
health status, or exposure to crime, pollution, and urban congestion, were not fully accounted for in GDP. Research also showed that
the distribution of material amenities affected individual wellbeing. There is now consensus that living standards depend not
only on average incomes and consumption but also on access to
benefits as diverse as health and education, sanitation and housing,
and security and freedom.a
There are ongoing systematic efforts to collect individual,
household, and community data to better understand and compare living standards in developing and developed countries. Complete poverty profiles for different groups of the population within
a country, based on the comparison of income or consumption
aggregates to international or national poverty lines, have proliferated. Microdata collection efforts have allowed a close monitoring

of standards of living and poverty reduction worldwide. Advances
toward the first Millennium De­velopment Goal (Eradicate extreme
poverty) have been documented using global monetary poverty
measures. The availability of richer datasets, in turn, has supported
the emergence of newer measures of living standards, many of
them multidimensional in nature. These measures combine both
monetary and nonmonetary indicators of well-being, as well
as information on their distribution across different population
groups.b
Despite this progress, important controversies remain, particularly on which indicators are more appropriate for gauging each
dimension of well-being and on the weights that should be attributed to each. Some recent proposals even suggest a revamping of
statistical systems to formulate better measures of production that
take into consideration changes in the quality of goods, government services, and time allocated to home activities and leisure.
There are also proposals to include among measures of living standards subjective indicators of well-being and indicators on the level
and sustainability of human, physical, and environmental assets.c
Other proposals emphasize subjective indicators building on a philosophical point of view.d Aggregating indicators and comparing
them over time and across space becomes more intricate in this
case, because of differences in values and beliefs.

The nature of production, consumption,
and investment activities varies across countries as well. In some, low hours of work among
youth are associated more with idleness than
with schooling; in others, schooling has proceeded at an accelerated pace. Similarly, job
characteristics change with development. In
rural economies where agricultural activities
predominate, the purpose of household production is often direct consumption. Less developed economies tend to be characterized
by more working time dedicated to jobs without wage payments, including farming and
other types of self-employment. Development
changes the organization of work from home
to market production.2 As economies develop,
more work is remunerated through wages and
salaries. This reallocation is usually accompa-

nied by higher market participation among
women.3 Developed and developing economies allocate a similar share of the day to
work. But women allocate a larger share than
men to activities not directly generating income
(figure 2.2).
Jobs do not automatically guarantee sustained improvements in earnings and wellbeing. Working people often remain mired in
poverty. In many countries, adults in poor
households are more likely to be working than
those in nonpoor households. The poor are not
usually characterized by lack of jobs or hours of
work; they often have more than one job and
work long hours, but their jobs are poorly remunerated (box 2.2).
In more affluent societies, a larger share of
income is derived from capital, transfers (social

assistance), or savings (social insurance and
pensions). Still, the majority of households
worldwide make their living through their work,
and labor earnings represent the largest share of
total household income (figure 2.3). The main
change that comes with development is the
composition of labor income.4
Job-related events are the main escape route
from poverty in developing and developed
countries alike. More than two decades of research on poverty dynamics, spanning countries
as different as Canada, Ecuador, Germany, and
South Africa, show that labor-related events
trigger household exits from poverty (figure
2.4). These events range from the head of a
household taking a new job, to family members
starting to work, to working family members
earning more from their labor. In a large set of

qualitative studies in low-income countries, getting jobs and starting businesses were two of the
main reasons people gave to explain their rise
out of poverty.5 Conversely, a lack of job op­
portunities reduces the ability of households to
improve their well-being.6
Jobs are not the only force that determines
whether a household escapes from poverty. Demographic changes, such as the arrival of a newborn, relatives moving in, or a family split because of death or separation, affect expenditures
per capita, hence the household’s poverty status.
The same is true of changes in nonlabor income
from assets or transfers, be they private remittances, public social assistance, or pensions.
These developments may all interact and often
occur simultaneously. For example, the migration of family members to a city for a job may

improve the well-being not only of the migrants
but also of those who stay in the rural village. In
addition to receiving remittances, those who stay
behind may have access to the migrants’ land to
cultivate and work more as a result.7
With all these changes occurring at the same
time, gauging the contribution of labor earnings
to poverty reduction is difficult. However, recent
methods allowing to decompose changes in poverty by sources of income confirm the fundamental contribution of change in labor earnings
(figure 2.5). In 10 of 18 countries considered for
the analysis, labor income explains more than
half of the change in poverty, as measured by the
US$2.50-a-day poverty line. In another 5 countries, it accounts for more than a third of the
­reduction in poverty.8 A further decomposition
of the contribution of labor income to poverty
reduction in Bangladesh, Peru, and Thailand
found that changes in individual characteristics

(education, work experience, or region of residence) were important, but that the returns
to these characteristics mattered more. Among
those returns is the relative price of labor. 9
The connection between jobs and poverty
reduction is not mechanistic, and not all transitions out of poverty require a change in the type
of work undertaken. Changes in the productivity of the same job may also be at play. In Bangladesh and Vietnam, for example, poverty transitions have been dominated not by changes in
income sources from farm to nonfarm income,
but by higher income within the same sector.10
Richer insights on the connection between
labor-related events and transitions out of poverty can be obtained from studies that follow
the same households over extended periods of
time. Studies in several countries in Asia and in
Sub-Saharan Africa show that farming and offfarm activities are intricately related and not

Most poor people work

BOX 2.2 

It is not lack of work that defines the poor. This realization has
brought to the fore the concept of the working poor, and questions
about who they are, and why they remain poor even when they
have jobs. First studied by researchers in some countries such as the
United States, this concept of the working poor is now recognized
globally. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has included
the working poor in its statistics since the mid-1990s, and measurements of this group have been added as a Millennium Development
indicator.
The working poor are defined as employed persons in households whose members are living below one of the two international
poverty lines—either US$1.25 or US$2 a day.a Household expenditure surveys allow for a classification of the population as poor and
nonpoor, based on the level of consumption per person. These surveys also provide information on household members who work.
According to the ILO’s most recent estimate, 910 million workers—
nearly 30 percent of total global employment—were living on less
than US$2 a day.b The incidence is much higher among low-income
countries. It reaches 63.7 percent in Africa and 54.2 percent in Asia.c

Caution is needed in interpreting this concept, however. Outside
the group of the working poor, there may be individuals who have
very low labor earnings but whose expenditures are above the poverty line because they have other sources of income such as private
transfers or earnings from social insurance or social assistance programs. In other words, being excluded from the category of working
poor does not mean one has high labor earnings.
Another concept that indicates whether job earnings are
­sufficient to ensure an adequate standard of living for a person
or a household is the living wage. This is the level of earnings
that would provide a satisfactory standard of living to workers
and their families. But moving from this definition to measurement
is difficult. With more than half of all working people engaged
in nonwage work, accurate measures of labor earnings may not
be available. Moreover, there are diverse interpretations of what
constitutes a standard family and a lack of consensus on computation methods.d An alternative is measuring the percentage of the
population that cannot reach the poverty line with labor incomes
only, as the Poverty Labor Trend Index in Mexico does.e

Note: Nonlabor events include changes in nonlabor earnings (such as rents or pensions) and demographic changes. A trigger event is defined as the most important event occurring
during a poverty reduction spell among a set of mutually exclusive categories of events such as changes in family structure, in sources of income, and in needs of the household.

necessarily substitutes for each other. Access to
land, increases in farm yields, and access to markets are fundamental for the growth of off-farm
jobs and hence for diversification in family incomes.11 Simply having work is not what matters most, according to these studies, since most
people work in rural economies. What is important for escaping poverty is deriving greater
earnings from work.
Other factors of production are critical for
explaining poverty reduction through jobs,
particularly in rural areas. Studies from Uganda
and Pakistan, using rural data spanning 4 and
10 years respectively, show that higher agricultural productivity, the growing commercialization of agriculture, and an increase in cash crop
production contributed substantially to poverty reduction. The increase in the price of cash
crops over this period also helped.12 Improvements in land rights and better access to input
and output markets, due to infrastructure in-

vestments, also raised the odds of escaping poverty, particularly in Uganda. All of these factors
affect the labor productivity of farmers but
originate in land markets or food markets
rather than labor markets.
The largest poverty reductions documented
are associated with jobs in agriculture. The cases
of China and Vietnam, in the 1980s and 1990s
respectively, testify to the importance of agricultural productivity and the forces unleashed by
land reform, investments in rural infrastructure,
and off-farm job opportunities.13 In rural China,
poverty reduction was associated with off-farm
activities, but the workers engaged in these activities tended to be those who had benefited
from increased farm incomes and by obtaining
more education.14 Furthermore, easier access to
off-farm employment and opportunities for migration reduced the exposure of households to
income shocks. A similar pattern of events has
been documented in other Asian and Sub-

Note: Family composition indicates the change in the share of adults (ages 18 and older) within the household. Labor income refers to the change in employment and earnings for
each adult. Nonlabor income refers to changes in other sources of income such as transfers, pensions, and imputed housing rents. If a bar is located below the horizontal axis, it
means that that source would have increased, instead of decreased, poverty. The changes are computed for Argentina (2000–10); Bangladesh (2000–10); Brazil (2001–09); Chile
(2000–09); Colombia (2002–10); Costa Rica (2000–08); Ecuador (2003–10); El Salvador (2000-09); Ghana (1998–2005); Honduras (1999–2009); Mexico (2000–10); Moldova (2001–10);
Panama (2001–09); Paraguay (1999–2010); Peru (2002–10); Nepal (1996–2003); Romania (2001–09); and Thailand (2000–09). The changes for Bangladesh, Ghana, Moldova, Nepal,
Peru, Romania, and Thailand are computed using consumption-based measures of poverty, while the changes for the other countries are based on income measures.

Saharan African countries. Whereas poverty reduction in rural areas in Asia is associated with
diversification into nonfarm activities, in SubSaharan Africa, it may be more closely associated with increases in farm productivity.15
Jobs and relapses into poverty are also connected. Widespread shocks such as droughts,
floods, and conflicts can drive households into
poverty or even chronic poverty. Events specific
to individuals, such as illness or poor health of
the head of household, can have the same effect.
In these cases it is not joblessness per se that
pushes families into poverty but rather the destruction of personal and household assets.16
And even taking these shocks into account, job
loss of the head of household remains a critical
determinant of a fall into poverty.17
The poor clearly rely on their labor to make
a living. The death or disability of an income
earner ­significantly increases the odds of falling
into poverty or remaining poor, particularly

among households with few assets. Studies from
Uganda and Pakistan show that the share of
household members who work also has a considerable impact. Households with rising dependency ratios were more likely to remain
poor or fall into poverty, while households
whose share of working-age adults increased
were less likely to fall into poverty or remain in a
state of poverty.18

Jobs are more than just earnings
Jobs have consequences beyond wages and earnings. Other aspects such as workplace safety,
stability, commuting time, learning and ad­
vancement opportunities, entitlements to pension benefits, and other amenities are highly valued by some workers. However, quantifying the
monetary value of these other aspects of a job
is not easy. Comparable surveys in Jianyang,

The value of job attributes can be quantified through hedonic pricing

Workers place a value on jobs that goes beyond income. At the individual level, people assess the impact a job might have on their
physical and mental well-being, as well as on their families. In addition to the earnings the job provides, they can value the stability of
a job, its earnings, the possibilities of advancement, or the flexibility
of working hours. Workers might also value how well a job connects
them to society, the prestige associated with it, or its contribution to
social goals.
Hedonic pricing assesses how people value specific job characteristics through their job satisfaction or happiness more broadly.
Indicators of subjective well-being are linked through sta­tistical
analysis to various job characteristics, including earnings. Statistical
methods can be used to assess the contribution of each of these job
characteristics to happiness or job satisfaction.
The weights associated with different job characteristics in the
estimated hedonic price function allow an assessment of the value
workers attach to each job characteristic. The monetary value of a
job characteristic can be assessed by comparing the corresponding
weight in the hedonic price function with the weight of earnings.
Thus, for instance, a hedonic function reveals the share of earnings
respondents would be willing to forgo in exchange for stability, or
for creativity at work, or for a job providing voice in the workplace.b
Using surveys commissioned for this Report, hedonic valuation
of health insurance benefits range from 1.5 percent of hourly wages

in Colombia and China to 4.2 percent in Egypt and 5.1 percent in
Sierra Leone.a This is significantly lower than the explicit valuations
answered by those surveyed: 4.9 percent in China, 10 percent in
Colombia and Sierra Leone, and, at the highest, 25 percent in Egypt.
This indicates that the revealed preference of individuals for health
insurance benefits in the job are lower than the price they express
they would be willing to pay. Hedonic pricing can also identify the
revealed preference to pay for other less tangible job charac­
teristics. Salaried workers in Colombia, China, and Egypt would
forgo up to 1.5 percent of hourly wages for jobs that are “meaningful.” In Egypt, salaried workers reveal a price tag equivalent of up
to 2.1 percent of hourly wages for jobs that are non-manual or
nonroutine.
This approach is especially relevant in the assessment of job
benefits. These benefits involve a deduction from earnings in ex-­
change for access to a pension in old age, for instance. Jobholders
typically value these benefits, but they may value them less than the
associated deductions in earnings through social security contributions. If the expected value of the pension is low or uncertain,
they may prefer to remain in the informal sector. In contrast, a welldesigned program that allows longevity risks to be pooled with
other jobholders may be valued by the jobholder more than the
deductions associated with participation.

China; Risaralda, Colombia; Cairo and Fayoum,
the Arab Republic of Egypt; and Port Loko and
Free Town, Sierra Leone, showed the limited
ability of respondents to attach a monetary value
to job benefits, despite expressing willingness to
pay.19 Among those who do give an explicit valuation, the willingness to pay for pension benefits
goes from 5 percent of monthly wages in China
to 7 percent in Colombia and 13 percent in
Egypt. Lower values are given for transportation
allowances (2, 1, and 7 percent, respectively), but
having a permanent contract is valued more, especially in Egypt (3, 8, and 22 percent, respectively) (box 2.3).
Characteristics of jobs have other less tangible, but no less real, effects on well-being. In
particular, jobs can have a direct impact on
workers’ health, a key component of human
development and personal well-being (box
2.4). Ex­posure to hazardous substances causes
an ­estimated 651,000 deaths annually, mainly
in developing countries. Work-related acci-

dents and diseases kill an average of 6,000 people a day, or 2.2 million a year. Most of these
deaths (1.7 million) result from work-related
diseases; the remainder is linked to fatal accidents in the workplace and during commutes
to or from work.20 Every year, more than 400
million people (nearly 15 percent of the global
labor force) suffer from occupational accidents
or illnesses involving work-related diseases. In
some cases, the incidence is intolerably high:
half of slate pencil workers in India and 37 percent of the miners in Latin America suffer from
some stage of silicosis (an occupational lung
disease caused by inhalation of silica dust).21
Mental health can be threatened by abusive relations between managers and workers and
sexual harassment. Health risks are not confined to wage employment. Collecting and carrying water or cooking over open stoves, as
many self-employed workers do, poses risks,
and these risks are more likely to ­affect women
than men.22

Work can pose risks to health and safety

Surveys of workers in garment factories in three countries underscore the
health and safety hazards they face in their jobs. Garment workers in Indonesia,
Jordan, and Haiti have reported physical stresses linked to work, including hunger, thirst, and severe fatigue.
In Indonesia, more than half the workers surveyed reported that they had
experienced severe thirst often or every day. Heat is a likely contributor. Asked
whether the factory is too hot or too cold, only about half (52 percent) reported
that temperature was not a concern. Occupational safety is an issue for many:
59 percent of workers reported concerns about dangerous equipment; 73 percent were concerned about accidents; 64 percent, about dusty or polluted air;
and 69 percent, about chemical odors.
In factories in Jordan, 37 percent of workers reported concerns about dangerous equipment, and 45 percent reported concerns about accidents and
injuries.
In Haiti, 40 percent of workers reported that they had experienced severe
fatigue or exhaustion occasionally, often, or every day; 41 percent reported
frequent headaches, dizziness, backaches, or neck aches. A stunning 63 percent of workers reported that they had experienced severe thirst often or
every day.

Occupational accidents and work-related
diseases have economic costs. These costs are
difficult to compute because the estimates
ought to include spending on health care and
sickness benefits, as well as the forgone earnings from workdays lost. Estimating these costs
is particularly difficult in the case of the selfemployed. The few studies that have tried to do
so suggest that the burden on society could be
high. In Spain, in the industrial sector alone,
these costs were estimated to amount to 1.72
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
2004. In Mauritius, the cost of work-related injuries r­ epresented around 2.8 percent of GDP
in 2003.23 Global estimates put the cost asso­
ciated with work-related sickness at around 4
percent of GDP.24
Opportunities to participate in labor markets
for people with disabilities vary across countries.
The employment ratio of people with disabilities
ranges from 70 percent, in Poland, to 20 percent,
in Switzerland and Zambia, lower than the ratio
for the overall population.25 Disabilities may be
preexisting conditions or the result of job-related
injuries or conditions. Different labor outcomes
among persons with disabilities stem from productivity differentials, from disincentives created

by the system of social benefits, and from discrimination. In any case, a lower employment
rate is one of the main channels through which
disability may lead to poverty.
In countries where wage employment is
the norm, joblessness may severely affect wellbeing. Together with income, social status has
been recognized as an important factor in the
development and maintenance of mental
health.26 Studies document the detrimental effects of unemployment and the positive effects
when finding a job.27 Medical research has associated unemployment with stress, depression,
heart disease, and alcoholism.28 Psychological
hardship, marital dissolutions, and suicide have
also been associated with job loss.29 Depression
and stress-related illnesses are becoming more
common with the expansion of outsourcing,
labor informality, and mobility in the modern
workplace.30
The impact of unemployment on mental
health appears to occur independently of the
availability of social insurance or other mechanisms of protection.31 This is because the psychological hardship of unemployment is also
associated with social stigma. Studies show that
a worker who is unemployed or who has a vulnerable job faces less duress if the phenomenon
is more pervasive or if there is less inequality in
the incidence of unemployment or the distribution of vulnerable jobs. This finding demonstrates the close interaction between a person’s
job and their place in society.32

Jobs and life satisfaction
Happiness, both a personal goal and a social aspiration, is related to employment status. A large
body of literature shows that unemployed people report lower happiness and life satisfaction
than their employed counterparts.33 For instance, in Indonesia subjective well-being increases when gaining a job and decreases when
losing it.34 Some researchers argue that this discontent is transitory, but others point out that,
as long as concerns about job stability persist,
so does un­happiness. This “unhappiness effect”
is more typically reported in men than in
women, but evidence indicates that women are
affected by the unemployment of their spouse.

The lack of employment can lower the selfesteem and undermine the ­social status of other
family members.35
When jobs are in short supply and unemployment becomes a problem, people change
their expectations and attitudes. Data from the
World Value Surveys for a large set of countries
(both developed and developing) show that
higher unemployment rates are associated with
lower ambitions to do meaningful work, perhaps indicating that a lack of available jobs impels individuals to accept any job.
It is not only one’s joblessness that may be
important to life satisfaction. In the United
Kingdom, the unemployed are less unhappy in
districts in which the unemployment rate is
higher, suggesting that joblessness always hurts
but that it hurts less if there are many unemployed people in the local area.36 The effect on
happiness of not having a job seems to be partially offset by the lower social stigma when
the lack of jobs is widespread. Joblessness also
leads to a loss of contact with people through
the workplace and to a contraction in related
social networks, which can erode social capital
and undermine the sense of engagement with
others.37
Simply having a job does not guarantee
higher life satisfaction. Feeling insecure at work
because of earnings variability, job instability, or
health and safety concerns also affects a person’s
sense of well-being (figure 2.6).38 For wage
workers, the type of contract and its duration
are important; part-timers and seasonal workers express less job satisfaction. Even workers
with long-term contracts may feel insecure.39 In
factories in Haiti, Jordan, and Vietnam, earnings from work did not influence the reported
level of life satisfaction, but working conditions
did.40 In more developed countries, jobs that
provide more autonomy are linked to higher life
satisfaction.41
Most research on the links between jobs and
life satisfaction has been conducted in settings
where wage employment is the norm. A growing literature on life satisfaction in developing
regions, where a smaller share of those who
work are wage earners, shows that farmers have
the lowest levels of life satisfaction relative to
other workers and the unemployed (figure
2.7). Meanwhile, wage workers and the self-

employed have higher levels of satisfaction
than the unemployed.
Whether the self-employed express greater
satisfaction than wage workers depends on the
context. In industrial countries and in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia, life satisfaction is, on
average, similar among both groups, but in
Latin America, it is substantially lower among
the self-employed.42
Jobs contribute to how people view themselves and relate to others. Most people feel
strongly that their jobs should be meaningful
and contribute to society. A 2005 survey of 29
countries asked people about the characteristics
that they valued in their jobs.43 Over threequarters reported that it is important to have a
job that is useful to society, and a similar share
agreed that it is important that their jobs help
other people. In nine countries, the share who
reported that it is important for jobs to be socially useful was higher than the share reporting
that high income is important. While most of
these are high-income countries, preferences for

and social norms. Notwithstanding this, other
health variables used as proxies of job satisfaction such as absence of fear or sadness also
show an association with working conditions.

socially useful and high-income jobs did not differ greatly in the Dominican Republic, Mexico,

Job satisfaction and other measures of nonmaterial well-being such as happiness or identity may be affected by cultural differences

Jobs have an impact on the well-being of the
person who holds them, but they can also have
an impact on the well-being of others. Some
jobs bring more poverty reduction and, as
such, benefit those who consider eradicating
poverty to be a fundamental societal goal.
Some jobs promote higher employment rates
among women, giving more say on the way
household resources are allocated, typically
leading to greater spending on raising children.
Gender equality, much the same as poverty reduction, is a broadly shared societal goal. Jobs
that have these additional impacts do more for
development. Given such spillover effects, jobs
play a fundamental role in the well being of
­individuals and entire societies. Jobs may thus
be the center piece of a development strategy
(Question 2).

QUESTION

2

Growth strategies or jobs strategies?

Rapid and sustained growth is generally viewed
as the main priority for developing countries,
and as a precondition for continued increases in
living standards and strengthened social cohesion. Economic growth, living standards, and
social cohesion can indeed move together, and
they often do—as shown, for example, by the
remarkable experience of East Asian economies,
including the Republic of Korea and Singapore.45 Building on the East Asian experience,
the conventional wisdom is to focus on growth
and assume that increased living standards and
greater social cohesion will follow. This is the
main tenet behind “growth strategies,” “growth
diagnostics,” and “binding constraints analyses,”
all of which aim to identify and remove obstacles to economic growth and to sustain it over
prolonged periods of time.
But transformations in living standards, productivity, and social cohesion do not necessarily
happen at the same pace. Lags and gaps in rising
living standards can be illustrated by the different impacts growth has on poverty reduction
across countries. A 2 percent annual growth rate
can reduce poverty rates by 1 percent in some
countries and by 7 percent in others.46 Ethiopia,
Tanzania, and Zambia experienced periods of
economic growth with very little change in poverty incidence.47 On the other hand, important
advances in poverty reduction have also happened during periods of slow growth, as occurred in Brazil and Mexico during the 1990s
and the first half of the 2000s.48 And in some
cases, growth is not accompanied by increased
social cohesion—even though poverty may fall
and living standards improve for some, the expectations of others remain unfulfilled. Tunisia
is a clear example in this regard: its growth rate
is well above the average of the region, but it has
nonetheless experienced serious social and political tensions.49
The recognition of these lags and gaps has
led to more nuanced approaches to economic
growth in which the growth being sought is
“pro-poor,” “shared,” or “inclusive.”50 In these
versions, it is not just the rate of growth that
matters but also the initial distribution of in-

come and the possibility of redistributing resources through the growth process itself and
through government transfers.51
Behind these sensible qualifiers, it is possible
to point to the role of jobs. Growth is “inclusive”
when higher earnings are driven by employment opportunities for the majority of the labor
force, particularly the poor. Recent studies show
that the impact of economic growth on poverty
reduction depends critically on the employment
intensity of different sectors.52 Employment
­opportunities also matter for social cohesion.
It is thus jobs that bring together the three
transformations.
Realizing the role jobs play implies going beyond the sequential view in which growth issues
are addressed first and employment follows
from increased demand. Instead, jobs are seen
as a medium that can make the development
transformations a reality. From a sta­
tistical
point of view, the relationship between growth
and employment (or unemployment) shows
substantial variation over time, across countries,
and across sectors. In light of this diversity, a
given rate of growth does not guarantee a given
level of job creation or a given composition of
employment (box 2.5).

When a growth strategy may not be
sufficient
Focusing on the aggregate relationship between growth and employment downplays
some of the most important channels through
which jobs connect to development. The very
notion of employment as derived labor demand does not reflect the situation of the many
working people in developing countries who
are farmers and self-employed. The focus on
the labor market as the transmission chain between growth and employment also does not
capture the interaction of working people with
others in households, at the workplace, and in
society more broadly. Focusing solely on the
relationship between growth and employment
may fail to measure how jobs can foster gender
equality, support urbanization, or contribute

BOX 2.5 

The relationship between growth and employment is not mechanical

The statistical connection between economic growth and employment is sometimes termed Okun’s Law. In 1962 Arthur Okun found
that in the years immediately following World War II, a 1 percent
increase in gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States
brought about a 0.3 percent decline in unemployment. Since then,
this empirical regularity has found support in a wide variety of countries. Recent research, however, suggests that Okun’s Law is not as
stable as its name implies.a
The debate on the stability of Okun’s Law sheds light on the characteristics of economic recessions and expansions. A recent study
indicates that, in industrial countries, unemployment has become
more responsive to output declines over the past 20 years. This has
been attributed to institutional reforms that have made labor markets more flexible. Interestingly, economies that suffer financial crises and large housing price busts (such as the United States and
Spain in recent years) have deeper and longer increases in unemployment than Okun’s Law would have predicted; whereas economies with large short-time work schemes (like Germany, Italy, Japan,
and the Netherlands) show less unemployment than predicted.b
While Okun’s Law relates to unemployment, other studies focus
on the growth elasticity of employment. In its simplest form, this
elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in employ-

ment and the percentage change in GDP. These elasticities show
great variability over time and space, too, making it difficult to forecast net job creation over the course of development. For instance,
in Tanzania growth elasticities of employment declined from 1.04 in
the period 1992–96 to 0.27 in the period 2004–08. Similar trends
have been reported for Ethiopia, Ghana, and Mozambique.c In Latin
America, recent estimates show that growth elasticities of employment were much lower during the global financial crisis than in previous crises. In other words, the Great Recession produced comparatively less net employment destruction in that region.d
While employment and unemployment are aggregates, growth
may also affect the composition of unemployment. Important controversies, such as why manufacturing employment in India has
stagnated despite rapid growth in the sector can be interpreted in
this light.e Other studies show that, given their different labor intensities, economic growth in some sectors like agriculture, construction, or services generates more employment than does economic
growth in manufacturing.f Investment projects in agribusiness in
Ukraine, in construction in India, and in tourism in Rwanda have had
large employment impacts, not only because of the direct jobs created but also because of indirect job creation in their large network
of distribution channels.g

to peaceful collective decision making. Understanding how to enhance these positive spillovers from jobs might be difficult when only
aggregates are considered.
The case of urbanizing economies such as
Bangladesh may support the idea that the three
major transformations happen simultaneously.
Taking advantage of their abundance of relatively low-skilled labor, such economies can
­engage in world markets through light manufacturing. Wage employment is created in large
numbers, providing opportunities for rural migrants, and cushioning social tensions at a time
of rapid social change. In Bangladesh, the expansion of the light manufacturing sector has
allowed for the integration of young women
into the labor market, at a time of falling fertility
rates. Employment opportunities for women
have in turn led to growing female schooling,
better human development outcomes, and
faster poverty reduction.

In practice, however, tradeoffs between the
three transformations can amount to more than
just lags and gaps. Depending on the nature of
the jobs challenges facing a country, tensions
may emerge between growth that generates jobs
for living standards and growth that generates
jobs for productivity growth or for social cohesion. Examples abound:

•	

In agrarian economies, increasing productiv­
ity in smallholder farming is fundamental for
poverty reduction, given the share of the population living in rural areas. But urban jobs in
activities that connect the economy to world
markets and global value chains are necessary
for growth. With limited resources to support
both, a tradeoff between living standards and
productivity may arise.

•	 In

resource-rich countries, massive investments in extractive industries support accel-

	

Jobs and living standards   

erated rates of growth and connections with
international markets but generate little direct (or even indirect) employment and often little poverty reduction. Moreover, the
abundance of foreign exchange undermines
the competitiveness of other activities, making it difficult to create productive jobs in
other sectors.

•	

In countries with high youth unemployment,
job opportunities are not commensurate with
the expectations created by the expansion of
education systems. And the active labor market programs needed to defuse social tensions
in the short term may not do much for poverty reduction because many of the jobless
come from middle-class families, and devoting public resources to finance them may reduce economic dynamism.

•	

In formalizing economies, there is an effort
to support social cohesion by extending the
coverage of social protection to as many
workers as possible. Broad coverage regardless of the type of job is often seen as part of a
social compact. But extending coverage without distorting incentives to work, save, and
participate in formal systems is difficult and
may have adverse impacts on productivity
and long-term growth.

When a jobs strategy may be appropriate
Tradeoffs between improving living standards,
accelerating productivity growth, and fostering
social cohesion arguably reflect a measurement
problem. While the contribution jobs make to
output can be quantified, some of the spillovers
from jobs cannot. Measured output does not
increase when jobs defuse social tensions, even
though these outcomes are valued by society
and may increase productivity in the future.
Conversely, measured output does not decline
when jobs in export sectors are replaced by jobs
producing for the domestic market, even
though the oppor­tunities to acquire technical
and managerial knowledge through work tend
to be higher in the export sectors.
If the spillovers from jobs could be appro­
priately quantified, the tradeoffs would be fully
understood and an adequate evaluation of the
output and employment potential of a given
growth strategy would be possible. For example,

fully accounting for the negative impact of current pollution on workers’ future health would
make a more complete evaluation of the output
potential of a growth strategy based on a given
technology. Opting for defused tensions or
greater integration in world trade would lay the
ground for accelerating growth in the future in a
sustainable way, which a short-term evaluation
based on output growth alone would fail to consider. If measures of growth captured the intangible social benefits from jobs, a growth strategy
and a jobs strategy would be equivalent. However, when focusing on measured growth only,
spillovers from jobs can easily be overlooked,
and this is why a jobs strategy may be needed. By
focusing on the spillovers from jobs, a jobs strategy highlights the different outcomes of interest
in a development process.
Considering a jobs strategy is a way to call
attention to the social value of jobs. A jobs strategy assesses the types of jobs that do more for
development in a particular country context. It
relies on qualitative and quantitative analyses to
identify how jobs contribute to living standards,
productivity, and social cohesion. And it seeks to
identify where the constraints to the creation of
the jobs with the highest development payoff
lie in practice. In some cases, a jobs strategy will
focus on increasing female labor participation,
in others on creating employment opportunities for youth, yet in others on creating a supportive environment for the creation of jobs in
cities, or jobs connected to global value chains.
This may not be too different from preparing
a more comprehensive growth strategy, except
that jobs would be center stage.
Jobs strategies are not needed under all circumstances. A jobs strategy is warranted only
when potentially important spillovers from
jobs are not realized, leading to tensions between living standards, productivity, and social
cohesion. When improvements in living standards, productivity, and social cohesion happen
together, as was the case in several East Asian
countries, and may now be the case in urbanizing economies such as Bangladesh, a growth
strategy may be more appropriate. Yet even remarkably successful East Asian economies such
as Korea and Singapore, which undoubtedly delivered inclusive growth over many decades, also
had jobs strategies at specific points in their development histories (box 2.6).

BOX 2.6 

Korea went from a growth to a jobs strategy, and Singapore the other way around

The Republic of Korea and Singapore are success stories combining
long-term economic growth with rapid poverty reduction and
strong social cohesion. But at different points in time, both countries relied on jobs strategies.
Singapore was confronted with a tense social situation at independence, with both high unemployment and inter-ethnic tension.
Its first development strategy focused on jobs, housing, and wage
moderation. As unemployment subsided, the next strategy was
geared toward raising labor costs to encourage higher-value-added
activities. This cost drive resulted in a recession, however, and since
then Singapore has focused on growth, rather than jobs.
Conversely, Korea abandoned development planning in 1996,
but in 2010, it adopted a jobs strategy for the next decade as its
highest-level policy document. In October 2010, the Korean government launched the “National Employment Strategy 2020 for the Balance of Growth, Employment and Welfare.” In the tradition of longrange plans, this national strategy has a clear target for 2020: an
increase in the employment rate of the working-age population
(15–64 years) to a minimum of 70 percent—the average among
industrial economies. The strategy was rooted in the mismatch
between macroeconomic indicators that pointed to a recovering
economy and the inability of individuals—especially youth—to find
adequate employment.

The strategy identifies four pillars to achieve the 70 percent target. The first recognizes the importance of collaboration between
the public and private sectors for employment creation and consists
of implementing economic and industrial policies in a job-friendly
manner. The second aims at improving flexibility and fairness in the
workplace and consists of a series of reforms to increase regulation
in certain areas of the labor law, while decreasing regulation in others. Thus the 40-hour workweek became enforceable for all companies, regardless of size,a with the obligatory introduction of the work
time savings system.b Simultaneously, regulations on duration of contracts for temporary workers and fixed-term contracts were relaxed
to allow for more hiring flexibility. The third pillar focuses on increasing labor force participation and skill development of women, youth,
and older workers. This involves developing the option of permanent part-time jobs, thus allowing parents to both work and care for
their children, especially in sectors suffering from labor shortages
and unable to fill full-time jobs. Older workers would be retained
longer in the active labor force by having the option to work shorter
hours under the wage peak system.c Last but not least, the intention is to facilitate welfare-to-work transitions, by encouraging ablebodied welfare recipients to enroll in employment assistance programs and by reinforcing their obligation to pursue employment.

a.	The 40-hour workweek was introduced in 2004 and applied only to companies with over 1,000 employees.
b.	This system allows employees to take leave to compensate for overtime, work during holidays, or night work.
c.	The wage peak system allows companies to rehire workers after they retire.

Jobs and productivity
Reallocation from low- to high-productivity jobs matters more for growth in
developing countries, where differences in productivity across sectors and within
sectors are wide. But reallocation often amounts to little more than churning.

P

roductivity growth happens as jobs become more productive, as new highproductivity jobs are created, and as lowproductivity jobs disappear. In the medium
term, trends in employment align closely with
trends in the labor force, so there is no such a
thing as jobless growth. But the short-term relationship between employment and growth is
more complex. Large numbers of jobs are being
created and destroyed simultaneously, leading
to structural change and spatial labor reallocation. Underneath these sectoral and spatial
changes are firm dynamics that result in a constant restructuring and reallocation of resources,
including labor.
In developing countries, many people work
in very small and not so dynamic economic
units. Family farms, which often predominate
in agriculture, average only 1.2 hectares in Asia,
and 1.8 hectares in Sub-Saharan Africa. Outside
of agriculture, microenterprises and household
businesses account for a large share of employment in a majority of developing countries.
These businesses make a significant contribution
to gross job creation and destruction, although
not necessarily to net job creation and productivity growth.
In agriculture, the Green Revolution has
led to higher cereal yields and to employment
growth because the new technologies are labor
intensive. The progress has been uneven across

regions, however. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the
Green Revolution has not taken place on a large
scale.
Outside of agriculture, productivity varies
substantially across enterprises, implying potentially large productivity gains from job reallocation. The speed at which productivity grows
also varies. Large firms are more innovative,
provided that they are exposed to competition.
At the other end, microenterprises are a diverse
group. A vast majority of them, more prone to
churning than to growth, are a means of survival
for the poor. Yet some are entrepreneurial, and
their success could boost wage employment.

Employment turbulence,
not jobless growth
Jobless growth is a popular notion, often believed to be grounded on data. However, unemployment rates neither explode nor vanish over
time, so employment trends align closely with
trends in the size of the labor force. The growth
of gross domestic product (GDP) certainly matters for employment growth, but in the medium
term it matters less than demographics and participation rates. Data from 97 countries over the
past decade confirm that a positive relationship
exists between the growth of GDP per capita and
the growth of employment per capita (figure

BOX 3.1 

What drives economic growth?

At the risk of simplifying, four main forces lie behind increases in an
economy’s per capita output. The first is the use of more capital per
unit of labor. The second is an increase in the number of people
working, relative to the total population. This happens when fertility
declines and the share of adults in the total population increases;
it is also happens when women shift their work from household
chores to income-generating activities. The third mechanism
through which output can grow is by making people themselves
more productive. The acquisition of skills, also known as human
capital accumulation, allows a person to do more using the same
amount of capital. The fourth mechanism is technological progress,

measured as changes in total factor productivity. Technological
progress amounts to combining capital, labor, and skills more efficiently, while applying new knowledge.
Growth decomposition quantifies the contribution of each of
these four forces to economic growth. It can be done for any particular country given sufficient data on gross domestic product, capital, employment, and human capital. Some of these variables may
need to be constructed or approximated; for instance, the stock of
capital in an economy is estimated based on accumulated investments, while human capital is approximated by the educational
attainment of its population, corrected for the quality of education.

3.1a).1 The relationship is not very strong, but
only in very few cases was growth truly jobless.
On the other hand, the short-term relationship between growth and employment is not
so straightforward. Growth happens partly
through the disappearance of low-productivity
jobs as well as through the creation of more
productive jobs.2 So for the same sample of
countries over the same decade, surges in total
factor productivity (TFP) in one year were in-

deed associated with a decline in employment in
the same year (figure 3.1b). Only in subsequent
years did this negative employment effect wane.
Productivity growth is a turbulent process. Analyses covering economies as different
as Ethiopia and the United States in different
periods over the past three decades reveal the
magnitude of gross job creation and gross job
destruction (figure 3.2). In the manufacturing
sector of developing countries, between 7 and

Note: The figure shows annual job flows. Data are from Argentina (1996–2001); Brazil (1997–2000);
Canada (1984–97); Chile (1980–98); Colombia (1983–97); Estonia (1996–2000); Ethiopia (1997–2007);
Finland (1989–97); France (1989–97); Germany (1977–99); Hungary (1993–2000); Indonesia (1991–94); Italy
(1987–94); Latvia (1983–98); Mexico (1986–2000); the Netherlands (1993–95); Portugal (1983–98); Romania
(1993–2000); Slovenia (1991–2000); Taiwan, China (1986–91); the United Kingdom (1982–98); the United
States (1986–91, 1994–96); and República Bolivariana de Venezuela (1996–98).

20 percent of jobs are created every year, while
a similar proportion disappear.3 Even when
aggregate employment was declining, as in
the 1990s in Romania and Slovenia and in the
manufacturing sector of República Bolivariana
de Venezuela, many new jobs were being created. Conversely, when aggregate employment
was growing by 6 percent in Mexico, jobs were
disappearing at almost twice that rate.
Job flows may be associated with profound
transformations in the sectoral structure of the
economy. Technological change often occurs for
specific products and processes, causing productivity to grow at different paces in different
sectors. However, the relative weight of different
sectors in the economy is determined not only
by technological progress, but also by market
demand and nonmarket forces. When there is
an expansion of the most productive sectors, aggregate productivity increases. This composition
effect, called productivity-enhancing structural
change, is well documented in the case of labor
shifts from agriculture to industry and services.
Analysis based on more disaggregated data suggests that reallocation of labor across sectors has
also been an important driver of productivity
growth in several fast-growing East Asian countries. In China, it contributed 4.1 percentage
points of the 7.3 percent annual growth in aggregate labor productivity over the past decade;
in Vietnam, it accounted for 2.6 points out of 4.2
(figure 3.3).4
Job flows are also associated with changes
in the spatial distribution of employment.
The structural shift from agriculture in rural
areas to industry and services in towns and
cities may be the most visible example of spatial labor reallocation, but it is not the only
one.5 Even within sectors, job flows often have
a strong spatial dimension. New plants associated with more innovative activities tend to start
in large, diversified cities—incubators—with
a higher density of suppliers and labor, and
more fluent exchanges of information. As they
mature and become more self-sufficient in information, these plants move to smaller cities,
where land and wage costs are lower. As a result,
many medium and small cities tend to be more
specialized.6
The extent of spatial relocation varies across
sectors and countries. For instance, in the Republic of Korea, manufacturing dominance in

Source: World Development Report 2013 team estimates based on Kucera and Roncolato 2012.
Note: The figure shows the decomposition of labor productivity growth in 81 economies over 1999–2008 into productivity changes due to changes within sectors and reallocation
across sectors. Seven sectors are considered: agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing; mining and utilities; manufacturing; construction; trade, restaurants, and hotels; transport,
storage, and communication; and other services. The regional growth rates are weighted averages, with weights based on an economy’s share in regional GDP.

urban centers has continued for a long period
of time. Enterprises have been sprawling into
the suburbs of urban centers rather than leap­
frogging to different locations as in some in­
dustrial countries (map 3.1). Similar shifts are
happening in Brazil, China, and Vietnam.7 In
India, large manufacturing enterprises are moving away from urban centers into rural locations.8 Regardless of the nature of the shift, almost inevitably jobs are created in some places
and destroyed in others.
Underneath these sectoral and spatial changes
in the structure of employment are the firm
dynamics connecting job flows and productivity growth. Aggregate productivity grows when
existing firms become better at what they do,
when more productive firms enter the market,
and when less productive ones exit. It also grows
when more productive firms become bigger and
less productive ones become smaller. Decomposition analyses show that in most countries the

main driver of aggregate productivity growth is
firms becoming better at what they do (figure
3.4).9 Entry and exit also contribute, which indicates that new firms are more productive than
those exiting. In general, exiting firms see their
productivity decline before they close, whereas
new firms tend to attain the average levels of
productivity of their industry within five years.
These complex dynamics imply that at any point
in time, firms with very different productivity levels coexist, even within narrowly defined
industries.10
The popular perception that productivity
grows through downsizing at the firm level is
partially supported by these analyses. Indeed,
in many cases, employment tends to shrink in
firms experiencing rapid productivity growth.11
But downsizing is only part of the story. There
are also many successful upsizing firms, achieving both productivity growth and employment
growth.12 For instance, one-fourth of manufac-

Note: no. = number. The figure shows the contribution of each of the four groups to the annual growth rate of the variable of interest. The plants considered employ at least
10 workers and exist throughout the entire period. Successful upsizers are plants that increased both labor productivity and employment, successful downsizers are plants that increased productivity but reduced employment, unsuccessful downsizers are plants that reduced employment and productivity, and unsuccessful upsizers are plants that increased
employment but reduced productivity.

turing plants operating in Chile over 2001–06
were successful downsizers, consistent with the
popular perception. But another one-fourth
were successful upsizers, achieving both productivity and employment growth (figure 3.5).
More important, the successful upsizers contributed more to production, employment, and
aggregate productivity growth than the successful downsizers. Results were similar in Romania
between 2000 and 2005, and in Ethiopia between
2005 and 2009. While country experiences vary,
having a critical mass of successful upsizers is not
uncommon.
Across countries, successful upsizers in manufacturing industries tend to be younger, leaner,
and more innovative. Among survivors in the
same industry and region, younger firms were
more likely to be upsizers in Chile over 2001–06,
and successful upsizers in Romania over 2000–
05. In all three countries, survivors employing
fewer than 20 employees tended to upsize fewer
rather than downsize. In Romania, survivors investing more in capital per worker also tended to

be successful upsizers.13 Recent evidence based
on 26,000 manufacturers from 71 countries further shows that firms that innovated in products
or processes were more likely to be successful upsizers; they not only attained higher total factor
productivity than noninnovative firms; they also
exhibited higher employment growth.14
Transition economies in Europe illustrate
the links between job reallocation and productivity growth. Before reforms were implemented, these economies suffered from large
distortions caused by a rigid planning system,
which prevented resources from flowing to
more efficient uses. Liberalization led to massive downsizing and job losses. Eventually, it also
strengthened incentives, mobility, and markets,
opening up space for more productive private
companies. The entry of these dynamic players
contributed between 20 and 50 percent of total
labor productivity growth in the late 1990s. The
exit of obsolete firms released resources that
could be used more effectively by new or existing firms. Although lack of experience and small

104  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

size often made the new firms less productive
than the average firms of more advanced countries, these new firms were more efficient than
domestic incumbents. They played a strong role
in boosting productivity in medium- and hightechnology industries and in exerting competitive pressure on existing firms.15
China’s rapid productivity growth was
also underpinned by large-scale reallocation.
Beginning in 1978, economic reform efforts
gradually expanded the influence of markets
and deepened global integration. All of this
created unprecedented opportunities for the
formation of private entities, including township and village enterprises, and the entry of
foreign companies. During the first decade of
reform (1978–88), reallocation from agriculture to nonagriculture activities was the source
of almost half of all productivity growth. In the
following decades, however, the main drivers
of productivity growth were labor reallocation
out of the state sector, private sector vibrancy,
and state sector restructuring. The scale of
business entry was startling: the number of
industrial firms rose from 377,000 in 1980 to
nearly 8 million in 1996. The 2004 economic

census reported 1.33 million manufacturing
firms with annual sales above RMB 5 million.16
Most of them were private. The entry of these
new businesses and the closure of nonviable
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for
two-thirds of TFP growth in manufacturing
sectors over 1998–2006.17

Most jobs are in very small farms
and firms
Many people in developing countries work
in very small and not very dynamic economic
units—family farms, microenterprises, and
household businesses. Although microenterprises are often defined as firms employing ten
or fewer workers, many among them are actually one-person businesses. Given their contribution to total employment, these small economic units cannot be ignored. Understanding
their dynamics is crucial to deciphering the relationship between jobs and productivity.
In family farms, hired labor is usually employed in simple tasks such as weeding and harvesting, whereas family labor usually carries out
care-intensive activities such as water management, land preparation, and fertilizer application. Limited reliance on hired labor is due to
the difficulty to monitor effort, and without
machinery, farms cannot be expanded beyond
the size manageable by the family’s labor, which
is typically 1 to 2 hectares.18 Family farms dominate even in high-income countries, and owner
cultivation is the most common form of land
tenure, especially in Asia (figure 3.6).
At 1.2 and 1.8 hectares, respectively, average
farm size is small in both Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa.19 In Asia, farmers typically own land
plots, which they supplement through tenancy
contracts that facilitate transfers from relatively
land-abundant to relatively labor-abundant
households. Farms in Sub-Saharan Africa are
slightly larger than in Asia, but size and the importance of owner farming are becoming similar
in both regions.20 There are some exceptions to
this pattern. Colonial governments created large
farms in some developing countries, such as estates in southern Africa, haciendas in Latin
America and the Philippines, and plantations in
the Caribbean. In Sub-Saharan Africa, large areas are also held as customary land—owned collectively by extended families, clans, or lineage.21

Note: Microenterprises are firms, formal or informal, with fewer than 10 workers. Data for developing countries are from Argentina (2006–10); Bolivia (2005, 2007); Chile (2006,

(2009). Data for industrial countries are from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
and the United Kingdom over 2005–07.

Outside of agriculture, microenterprises
and household businesses are dominant. More
than 80 percent of registered manufacturing
establishments in Argentina, Bolivia, El Salvador, and Mexico have fewer than 10 workers.22
About 90 percent of manufacturing establishments employ 5 to 49 workers in China; India;
Indonesia; Korea; the Philippines; and Taiwan,
China.23 The share of microenterprises is even
higher outside manufacturing, reaching 94
percent in the services sector of Mexico and 98
percent in all modern sectors in Tunisia.24 In
several African and Latin American countries,
the majority of informal enterprises consist of
1- to 3-person businesses.25

It is often claimed that most employment, and
most job creation, is associated with small and
medium enterprises, but that is generally not true
in developing countries. In reality, micro- and
small enterprises account for the bulk of employment, even in middle-income countries (figure
3.7). Their share is often underestimated, because
economic censuses and plant-level surveys rarely
cover the informal segment of the economy,
where businesses are especially small. But data
from household and labor force surveys that are
representative of the entire population provide
a different picture. These small enterprises play
significant role in employment in manufacturing. They account for 97 percent of employment

Microenterprises account for most job creation and destruction

In some household and labor force surveys, employees are asked to
report the size of the firm they work for, or the size of their own business if they are self-employed. This information can be used to estimate the distribution of employment by plant size. This distribution
can in turn be used to correct for the omission of informal enterprises in an economic census or plant-level survey.
This approach was applied to Chile’s manufacturing survey, the
Annual National Industrial Survey (Encuesta Nacional Industrial
Anual), which covers more than 90 percent of employment among
establishments with 50 workers or more, but less than half the
employment in establishments with 10 to 49 workers. Nearly
300,000 workers in microenterprises are omitted from the survey;
250,000 of them work in firms with fewer than 5 employees.

The distribution of job flows by firm size that emerges from
the manufacturing survey can be adjusted based on the distribution of employment by plant size from Chile’s household survey,
the National Socio­economic Characterization Survey (Encuesta de
Caracterización Socioeconómica Nacional, or CASEN). Before this
adjustment, larger firms seem to account for most job creation and
destruction. But the adjustment shows that microenterprises contribute about 80 percent of gross job flows. This estimate should not
be taken literally, because the microenterprises for which information on job creation and destruction is available are not necessarily
representative—the Chilean census started to include microenterprises only in the late 1990s. But even with a margin of error, the
estimate is so large that it changes the picture of job creation and
job destruction.

in the manufacturing sector in Ethiopia and 39
percent in Chile. In services sectors, their role is
often more important. Even in Eastern European
countries, where private sector entry is only two
decades old, microenterprises account for 10 to
20 percent of employment in manufacturing and
for 30 to 50 percent of employment in services.
Micro- and small enterprises also play a critical
role in job creation and destruction (box 3.2).26

In farms, uneven technological
progress
It is generally assumed that large farms are more
productive. In low-income countries, however,

yields per hectare tend to be higher in smaller
farms, because family farms apply more labor
per unit of land, even though they apply fewer
purchased inputs. This inverse relationship between farm size and productivity was first observed in South Asia.27 But it has also emerged
in Sub-Saharan Africa as population pressure
on the land has led to agricultural intensification. In Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda,
a 1 percent increase in farm size is associated
with a 0.1 to 0.2 percent reduction in yield.28
The use of family labor per hectare is also inversely correlated with farm size.29
The relationship between crop yields and
farm size emerges, because the larger, more
mechanized farms have higher productivity. But

constraints in land markets usually slow expansion and mechanization.30
The new technologies of the Green Revolution contributed to job creation because they
were labor intensive. Short-statured, fertilizerresponsive, high-yielding varieties of rice and
wheat were developed by international agricultural research centers in the late 1960s. The
varietal improvement of other cereals such as
maize followed. These varieties, as well as improved production practices, were quickly diffused, particularly in tropical Asia. The amount
of inorganic fertilizer applied has steadily increased over extended periods.31 Thanks to
continual technological improvements and
sustained adoption, cereal yields have increased
dramatically for the past several decades.32
Progress has been uneven across regions,
however (figure 3.8). In Sub-Saharan Africa,
there is no evidence to suggest that small farmers were slower than larger farmers in adopting
the new technologies. But the Green Revolution
has not taken place on a large scale, even though
farmland has been growing scarce because
of population pressure on limited c­ultivable
areas.33 Feeding growing populations from a
shrinking amount of farm land requires SubSaharan African countries to increase cereal
yields.34 Yet improved agricultural technology
is location specific: improved varieties in Asia

may not be productive in Sub-Saharan Africa,
and high-yielding varieties in irrigated areas
may be low-yielding in rain-fed areas.35
The agricultural growth associated with
the Green Revolution not only creates jobs in
farming but also facilitates the development of
the nonfarm sectors.36 The adoption of modern technology stimulates the production and
marketing of fertilizer and other purchased
inputs. Increased supply of cereals stimulates
the development of food markets and keeps
the cost of living low for those who migrate to
the cities. In addition to these backward and
forward links, the increase in farmers’ incomes
heightens the demand for goods and services.37
Cross-country analyses show that agricultural
growth has resulted in the expansion of nonfarm sectors, particularly where the agricultural sector is large.38

Among firms, much churning and
few gazelles
Outside of agriculture, productivity varies substantially across enterprises, implying that job
reallocation could lead to large gains in aggregate productivity. In India, within a narrowly

Source: Pagés 2010.
Note: TFP = total factor productivity. The figure shows the ratio of TFP among plants between the 90th and the 10th percentiles of the TFP distribution within narrowly defined
industries. TFP is measured as physical productivity, as defined by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008). The data cover only the manufacturing sector. Data are from Argentina
(2002), Bolivia (2001), Chile (2006), China (2005), Ecuador (2005), El Salvador (2005), India (1994), Mexico (2004), United States (1997), and Uruguay (2005).

ates 22 times as much output as a plant at the
10th percentile. In comparison, the estimated
ratio is only 9 to 1 in the United States.39 The
dispersion of TFP is also high in a number of
Latin American countries (figure 3.9). Detailed
data on nonmanufacturing firms are scarcer.
But the dispersion of TFP in retail businesses in
Mexico, and in communication and transportation businesses in Uruguay, is also sizable.40
The speed at which productivity grows also
varies across firms. Large firms are typically
more innovative than small firms. They tend to
invest more in machinery and hire more educated workers. They are also more likely than
small firms to engage in activities such as developing new product lines, introducing new technology, opening and closing plants, outsourcing, and engaging in joint ventures with foreign
partners (figure 3.10a). Large firms produce
more with a given amount of labor, are more
likely to export, and tend to export more. They
also pay substantively higher wages than microand small enterprises (figure 3.10b). They pay a
wage premium even controlling for age, education, and other worker characteristics. Not all
large firms are innovative, however. When size
is supported through nonmarket mechanisms,

efficiency tends to suffer. Large SOEs without
foreign competitors are less innovative and productive than other large firms.41
For a given size, young firms are also more
likely than old firms to engage in innovative activities. They also have better growth prospects,
a finding consistent with evidence from industrial countries (figure 3.11).42 For example, in
the 1990s, when China was in the early stages
of reform, human and financial resources were
concentrated in SOEs. However, the incentive
structure in these enterprises hindered innovation. In contrast, the new township and village
enterprises lacked the resources to adopt new
technology and import new equipment, but
they were more flexible in their decision making. As a result, these younger firms were more
dynamic than large SOEs, although they were
less productive than large and medium private
companies.43
In developing countries, the dispersion of
productivity and growth prospects across firms
is further widened by the large number of
micro­
enterprises, many of which are barely
more than a means of subsistence for the poor.
A majority of these microenterprises have limited capital and often even lack a fixed address.

Most microenterprises are in rural areas and engage in commerce

Microenterprises in urban areas, and particularly those in the informal sector, tend to attract the attention of academics and policy
makers. But microenterprises are prominent in rural areas as well.
The surveys of micro- and small enterprises in Africa and in Latin
America and the Caribbean show that fewer than half are in cities
and towns with 20,000 inhabitants or more. The urban share reaches
46 percent in the Dominican Republic but is below 30 percent in all
other countries surveyed. Even if rural towns are counted (generally,
localities with 2,000 to 20,000 inhabitants), well over half of the
enterprises are in strictly rural areas in most countries.
The vast majority of microenterprises are engaged in commerce,
supporting the conventional view that associates microenterprises
with street vendors and petty traders. But a significant number are
involved in light manufacturing activities. According to the 1-2-3
surveys of West African countries, the most important sector in capital cities is petty trading (27.1 percent of all enterprises), followed by

other manufacturing and food (16 percent) and other services (11.8
percent). Similarly, the surveys of countries in Africa and in Latin
America and the Caribbean suggest that 56 to 74 percent of microand small firms in urban areas, and 60 to 70 percent in rural areas,
are engaged in commerce. The surveys of household enterprises in
Sub-Saharan African countries show similar patterns. These surveys
identify three manufacturing activities as the most important across
all countries: textiles and apparel, food and beverages, and wood
and forest products. These three categories account for about 75
percent of manufacturing enterprises in urban areas and nearly 90
percent of manufacturing enterprises in rural areas.
Most of the microenterprises operate from home or on the
street. According to the surveys of household enterprises in SubSaharan Africa, 25 to 45 percent of these microfirms use home as
primary point of operation, and 10 to 40 percent of them simply
work on the street.

Sources: Fox and Sohnesen 2012; Grimm, Kruger, and Lay 2011; Liedholm 2002.

Many are ­located in rural areas, absorbing some
labor slack during the low agricultural season
(box 3.3). Across 18 developing countries, 44
percent of the people living on less than US$1 a
day in urban areas, and 24 percent of those in
rural areas, work in a nonagricultural business.
On average, they do not earn much.44
Nonetheless, these nonfarm activities provide an important channel to diversify income
for the poor. In nine Sub-Saharan African countries, most nonfarm jobs were generated by
households starting businesses, rather than entering the rapidly expanding private wage sector.
Despite being modest, earnings from household
enterprises contribute to consumption much
the same as earnings from wage employment
do. And these small businesses offer an avenue
for poor households to engage in gradually
more productive activities.45
While microenterprises have a lackluster performance as a group, they are also very diverse.
In middle-income countries, a significant share
of the owners of micro- and small enterprises
are as entrepreneurial as their peers in industrial countries. Their weak performance may
be driven more by contextual factors such as
limited access to credit and policy-induced barriers to access technologies and markets, than
by limited capacity. In several Latin American countries, for example, entrants into selfemployment tend to be workers who have ac-

cumulated human and physical capital while
working for a wage or a salary. Operating
micro­­enterprises is a choice for them. Those
who achieve higher productivity levels are more
likely to stay in business, grow, and create job
opportunities for others.46
A very small group of microenterprises actually displays a strong performance. This group
bears similarities with the so-called “gazelles” of
industrial countries—high-growth companies
whose revenues increase by at least 20 percent
annually for four years or more. In industrial
countries, the term “gazelle” is used for com­
panies starting from a revenue base of at least
US$1 million, which makes them very big
by developing-country standards. Nonetheless,
the same dynamism can be found at a much
smaller scale. Data from seven Sub-Saharan
African countries show that the median capital
stock held by urban informal enterprises is less
than US$80, whereas the capital stock for those
in the top quintile averages US$5,000. The average monthly profit of those in the top quintile
is seven times the median monthly profit. The
rate of returns to capital is also relatively high in
these firms.47 This heterogeneity among micro­
enterprises suggests they can be an incubator
for large and productive firms.
The dynamism of microenterprises matters
not only for livelihoods but also for productivity
growth. Large firms innovate more, but they are

not all born large. In industrial countries, some
of the more resounding successes, from Honda
to Microsoft, started in garages. And many successful companies in developing countries also
grew out of small household businesses. Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group, founded in
1921 as a small seed shop in Bangkok by two
brothers, has grown into one of the world’s largest multinational conglomerates in agribusiness,
operating in 15 countries and encompassing
close to 100 companies.48 India’s Tata Group
transformed from a Mumbai-based, familyowned trading firm in the late 19th century to

a multinational conglomerate comprising 114
companies and subsidiaries across 8 business
sectors on several continents.49 Many of China’s
successful clusters, such as the footwear and
electric appliance industry in Wenzhou, also
started from small family businesses working
close to each other.50
A vibrant firm life cycle is often missing,
however. Larger and older firms tend to be
stagnant, while smaller enterprises are prone to
churning. In Ghana, for example, many firms
are born large and show little growth over 15
years (figure 3.12). In Portugal, by contrast,

many more firms are born as microenterprises
and grow substantially in 7 years.51 The majority of firms are born small in India too, but they
tend to stay small, without displaying much
variation in employment over their life cycle.
A revealing comparison involves the size of 35year old firms relative to their size at birth. In
India, the size declines by a fourth. In Mexico, it
doubles. In the United States, it is 10 times larger
(figure 3.13a). Productivity growth over a firm’s
life cycle follows similar patterns in these countries (figure 3.13b).52
Churning—entering and exiting at a relatively high rate—is much more common than
growth among the micro- and small enterprises
of developing countries. In several Sub-Saharan
African and Latin American countries, about 20
percent of micro- and small enterprises enter
and leave the market in the same year. A majority
of closures occur within three years of starting
up. Among the survivors, less than 3 percent expand by four employees or more.53 In Vietnam,

20 to 30 percent of household enterprises leave
the market over a two-year period, while the
total number of household enterprises remains
about the same.54 In Sub-Saharan Africa, few
household enterprises expand into employment
beyond the household, as shown by the experiences of Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Madagascar.55
In Mexico, individuals starting microenterprises
are more likely to remain the sole worker than to
increase the firm size (table 3.1).56
The wide dispersion of productivity among
businesses, the large number of unsustainable
microenterprises, and the stagnation of larger
firms all suggest that the process of market selection and creative destruction that has underpinned the rapid growth of transition economies
and East Asian countries in the past decades is
weak in most developing countries. This weakness impedes labor and other resources from
moving toward their most productive uses and
undermines both job creation and productivity
growth. Gains from tackling the difficulties faced

by the start-ups and removing constraints to the
growth of incumbents could be sizable, but the
task is daunting (question 3).57

* * *
Jobs can have an impact on the productivity of
others, beyond the jobholder and the economic
unit where they belong. Jobs that have these additional impacts do more (or less) for development. These additional impacts arise because
jobs differ in the way they connect with each
other, and some of the connections do not occur through markets. In functional cities, ideas

are exchanged among people more effectively,
making everybody more productive. In clusters, similar firms that locate next to each other
tend to benefit from a broader pool of qualified
workers and common support services. Firms
also connect with foreign businesses through
trade and investment, and, in integrating with
global value chains, they can acquire more advanced knowledge, technology, and management know-how. In all these ways, specific jobs
can contribute to productivity gains of others
and elsewhere in the economy. But effects can
be negative as well if jobs overuse natural resources or damage the environment, thus reducing aggregate productivity.

QUESTION

3

Can entrepreneurship be fostered?

Self-employment is prevalent in developing
countries, and micro- and small enterprises
are a major source of livelihood for low-skilled
workers. Even if only a small fraction of these
tiny economic units succeeded in building a
viable business, with the potential to hire others,
the aggregate effect on living standards would be
substantial. Their success would also matter for
productivity reasons. Quite a few currently large
enterprises in industrial countries started out as
­micro- and small family businesses. By contrast,
in developing countries many large enterprises
are born large, often the result of government
support or privileged access to finance and information. Breaking privileges is one more reason why the success of microenterprises is so
important.
Views differ on whether there is scope to
help the self-employed succeed. At one time almost every self-employed person or owner of a
microenterprise was seen as a potential entrepreneur, held back only by regulatory zeal and
corruption. Substantial rates of return on capital
for micro- and small enterprises were viewed as
evidence of a potential to thrive.58 But the pendulum has swung, and the conventional wisdom
is now rather pessimistic. The large numbers of
unregistered self-employed in developing countries are viewed as subsistence ­
entrepreneurs
who are trying to make ends meet, not thriving.59 Evidence on the growth of micro- and
small enterprises in several countries in Latin
America and West Africa shows that most microenterprises with at least two years of operations
remain at their start-up employment levels.60
Embedded in the pessimism of the conventional
wisdom is the idea that entrepreneurial ability
and skills cannot be easily transferred, especially
not to adults with limited formal education. In
this view, entrepreneurs are born, not made. If
this view is correct, attempts to convert survivorship into entrepreneurship are bound to fail. The
wide dispersion of productivity across firms, including across microenterprises, suggests, however, that reality is somewhere in between the
optimistic and the pessimistic view: survivor-

ship may be dominant, but entrepreneurship is
unlikely to be missing altogether.

Who is an entrepreneur?
Entrepreneurship combines innovative capacity to put new ideas into effect with managerial
capacity to increase a firm’s efficiency within the
limits of known technology. Specific psychological traits are associated with entrepreneurship,
such as a personal need for achievement, a belief
in the effect of personal effort on outcomes, selfconfidence, and a positive attitude toward risk.
These traits are difficult to observe or measure.
But surveys comparing entrepreneurs with other
workers in places as diverse as China and the Russian Federation show that observable individual
characteristics such as education, experience,
gender, location, and age are good predictors
of entrepreneurship.61 Among microenterprises,
rates of return on capital tend to be higher when
their owners are more educated and experienced.
Observable characteristics of the self-­
employed can thus be used to identify individuals who have potential to become successful
entrepreneurs.62 To illustrate the point, a successful entrepreneur is defined as someone who
employs others and is not living in poverty. The
share of this group in total employment is small
and relatively stable across countries at different levels of development.63 The share of selfemployed workers without paid employees, on
the other hand, initially increases and then declines with GDP per capita (figure 3.14a). At its
peak, which corresponds to low-income countries, the share of self-employed workers without paid employees reaches almost three-fifths
of total employment. Among this group, a majority are individuals with relatively low potential to succeed. Their characteristics are closer to
those of wage workers than of employers.64
However, if each of the self-employed workers with high potential were to create a single additional job, total employment would increase
substantially, somewhat more so in low-income
countries (figure 3.14b). As a share of the work-

ing age population, such additional job creation
would amount to 8 percent in Kenya, 5 percent
in the Arab Republic of Egypt and 4 percent in
Costa Rica.
While this calculation is hypothetical, several
studies report that observable characteristics of
micro- and small informal enterprise owners,
such as education and gender, are important
determinants of innovation and employment
growth.65 In Mexico, after a business registration reform, informal enterprise owners with
observable traits similar to those found among
formal enterprise owners were more likely to
register their business than those similar to wage
workers.66

What constrains entrepreneurship?
Even potentially skilled entrepreneurs would
have difficulty succeeding without access to
basic infrastructure and financial resources. In
their absence, managerial capacity alone may
not be enough to realize productivity gains and
employment expansion. The investment climate matters for business performance as well.

Removing obstacles to firm growth is thus a prerequisite to foster entrepreneurship.
Obstacles notwithstanding, entrepreneurial
capacity varies substantially across microenterprises and small firms. A distinction is often
made between innovative or transformative entrepreneurs and replicative or subsistence entrepreneurs.67 The former correspond to Schumpeterian type of entrepreneurs, while the latter, who
generally manage micro- and small enterprises,
are followers. Such a distinction, however, does
not capture the broader gradation of managerial
performance that lies between the transformative
and subsistence extremes. A study of the number
of management practices adopted by the owners
of micro- and small enterprises in Sub-Saharan
Africa reveals a large variation of management
scores (figure 3.15). These scores are closely associated with business performance.68 A broad
dispersion of management scores is also found
among relatively larger firms in India.69
An emerging literature confirms the importance of management practices in explaining
firm productivity. Although much of the focus
is on large firms, recent studies have turned their

Note: The management score measures the degree to which firm owners use and master core management and business techniques. Scores are based on an evaluation of 26

attention to how innovation in small and medium firms takes place. The most telling studies
involve management training provided for free
to randomly selected firms whose performance
is then compared to that of a control group of
firms. Evaluations of these programs find that
the training improves the financial literacy and
basic management skills of business owners. The
estimated impact is also positive, but less robust,
when it comes to improved business outcomes
and job creation. Better outcomes are associated
with business owners who already had an initial understanding of the concepts and relatively
better access to financial resources.
On the other hand, similarly designed interventions to provide financial resources to microenterprises, or to process their registration
with authorities, or to pay the salary of an additional employee, show mixed impacts on business performance.70 In Mexico and Sri Lanka,
grants given to microenterprises increase the
income of their owners—and then only if they
are male—but do not result in employment creation. In Ghana, similar grants given to female
business owners do not result in significant
growth of their microenterprises. In Sri Lanka,
only 22 percent of eligible microenterprises took

up an offer of a wage subsidy covering 50 percent
of the cost of hiring a worker for six months and
25 percent of the cost for another two months.
Overall, these results suggest that lack of access
to finance is not the only constraint.
Entrepreneurial skills, measured by the education of business owners and their partici­
pation in training, explain a large share of the
­differences in productivity across firms and regions in developing countries.71 Yet markets fail
to nurture entrepreneurship, because knowledge spillovers imply that some of the returns to
acquiring or developing new managerial ideas
are appropriated by others. More important
perhaps, entrepreneurs themselves do not recognize the relevance of management expertise.72
Only 3 percent of Brazil’s owners of micro- and
small enterprises, for instance, see management
as a binding business constraint.73 This may be
an area where information and knowledge failures matter, leading to a vicious circle of low
productivity, low living standards, and insufficient job creation.
The capacity to acquire skills and to apply
them to business seems to be one of the most
important characteristics of successful entrepreneurs. Success also depends on having core skills

	

Jobs and productivity   

such as numeracy and literacy, as well as social
skills. A vast literature highlights the importance
of entrepreneurs’ schooling as a determinant of
firm growth, employment, and efficiency.74 Russian and Chinese business owners have more
entrepreneurs in their families and among
childhood friends than otherwise similar individuals, suggesting that social environment also
matters.75
Learning can also happen through jobs.
Nearly half of entrepreneurs managing the 50
largest manufacturing firms in Ethiopia began their careers in trading companies, thereby
learning about the market and what it takes to
meet demand.76 A large number of founders
and leading entrepreneurs in the light manufacturing industries in Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa were initially traders or employees in the
marketing division of large enterprises.77
Integration in supply chains with larger, often foreign, firms, is receiving much attention
as a potential source of knowledge transfers.78
Indian entrepreneurs returning from Silicon
Valley made Bangalore a hub of the information
technology industry. Perhaps the most dramatic
evidence attesting to the importance of learning

from abroad can be found in the case of the garment industry in Bangladesh (box 3.4).

The case for targeted management
training
Managerial practices are linked to differences
in productivity, profitability, firm growth, and
survival.79 The development experience of the
garment industry in Bangladesh suggests that
entrepreneurship can be fostered by exposure
to advanced management practices and technologies. But whether managerial capacity can
be improved through management training is
more debatable. Creativity, foresight, and risk
taking are key elements of any innovative process, but the question is whether they can be diffused and nurtured.
A substantial number of experiments have
been conducted in recent years, providing evidence of both successes and failures of management training interventions. Some patterns
emerge from a systematic review of the available
evidence. To be successful, management training
must be kept simple, appropriate teaching materials must be available, and the training must

What explains the boom in the garment industry in Bangladesh?

The garment industry in Bangladesh illustrates how important it is
to learn advanced management practices, marketing, and technologies from abroad. When Daewoo Corporation of Korea teamed up
with Bangladesh’s Desh Ltd. to produce garments for export in Bangladesh in 1979, the South Asian country had no modern industry.
Little more than 20 years later, the industry was generating more
than US$12.5 billion in export revenue. Women accounted for 80
percent of its 3.6 million workers
Arguably, a wide set of factors, from financial innovation to policy support, contributed to this development success. But it began
in 1979, when Desh sent 130 newly recruited, educated employees
to Daewoo’s garment factory in Korea, where they participated in an
eight-month intensive training course covering topics from sewing
skills to factory management, quality control, and international procurement and marketing—skills that they then applied in the Desh
factories in Bangladesh. Within a few years, almost all the trainees
had left Desh to start their own garment businesses. Some of the
ex-Desh workers joined new garment factories established by affluent businessmen, while others founded trading houses, which then

contributed to the proliferation of garment manufacturers by providing a variety of valuable services including international procurement and marketing, sample making, and design reengineering.
Observing Desh’s good start in exporting, and subsequently the
success of ex-Desh workers, highly educated people started their
own garment businesses, and wealthy families actively invested in
the industry. As a result, the size of garment firms has been quite
large since the beginning; their average size was 300 workers in
1983–84 and 700 in 2010–11. As of 2005, owners of garment firms
had 15 years of schooling on average, and about 60 percent of them
had completed college or university education.
Learning from abroad continued. Some entrepreneurs participated in training programs in Singapore, Japan, and Europe. Beyond
garment enterprises in Korea, other newly industrial countries in
East Asia followed Daewoo into operation in Bangladesh and invested in training Bangladeshi workers and managers. Thus, many
Bangladeshi traders and manufacturers had work experience in garment trading and production, including the experience of working
at joint ventures, before starting their current businesses.

last for a certain minimum length of time. Complementing classroom teaching with instructors’
visits to trainees on the job can yield significant
positive effects.80 In Mexico, for example, such
on-site visits improved sales, profits, and productivity.81 But in Ghana, on-site visits and support for microenterprises were not successful.82
It is also possible that key entrepreneurial skills
are gained more effectively through work experience in large productive firms than through
training programs.83
Entrepreneurship training for women has
had mixed results. Nurturing female entrepreneurship has the potential to create wider social
benefits associated with female employment,
such as changes in the household allocation of
resources that improve family well-being, especially of children. Female entrepreneurship often
provides employment opportunities to women
that allow them to balance work and family
roles. Yet providing classroom training to female
microentrepreneurs in Peru had no effect on key
business outcomes such as sales and profits, even
when some business practices improved.84 Classroom training complemented with on-site visits,
though, yielded positive results.85 In Pakistan
and Tanzania, management training improved
management practices and business outcomes
for male but not female entrepreneurs.86 These
mixed results can also reflect wider constraints
facing women in societies, including access to effective learning in schools.
A common finding of training evaluations is
that the potential to absorb management practices differs greatly among beneficiaries. Readily
observable individual characteristics can help

identify those business owners with the highest
potential to benefit from management training. Expert panels may be used to identify and
rank micro- and small enterprises on their potential to grow, but such methods are expensive and difficult to apply on a large scale. An
effective alternative is a survey questionnaire
designed to capture abilities, attitudes, and management scores of potential trainees.87 Management training itself can be used as a screening
device. Trainees with high potential often undertake new investments and expand employment
as a result of their training. Financial institutions
could view such activity as an indication of potentially high investment returns. Programs that
combine management training with financial
support yield better firm performance in developing countries.88
Training programs can be implemented by
private providers and financed by private investors with a significant interest in the success of
the entrepreneurs in whom they have invested.
But as long as there are knowledge spillovers
and the importance of management expertise
is undervalued, governments have a role to play.
Given the differing capabilities among business
owners, proper targeting is crucial to ensure positive returns to publicly funded programs. Randomized experiments in Ghana, Tanzania, and
Vietnam indicate that the benefit of such programs generally outweighs the cost, even though
the costs of implementing training programs
vary greatly.89 If the overall investment climate is
not conducive to private sector growth, however,
targeted training programs for better business
skills will most likely return meager results.

fundamental source of self-respect and
social identity. Historically, family names in
some cultures were associated with specific occupations because people defined themselves
by what they did: Miller in English, Hurudza
(master farmer) in Shona, and Suthar (carpenters) in Hindi.
Jobs connect people with others through
networks. The workplace can be a place to encounter new ideas and information and to interact with people of different ethnicities. The distribution of jobs within society and perceptions
about who has access to opportunities and why
can shape people’s expectations and aspirations
for the future, their sense of having a stake in
society, and perceptions of fairness.
These individual influences of jobs may
have collective consequences. Having or not
having a job may affect key elements of social
cohesion, the capacity of societies to manage
collective decision making peacefully. While
the frustration of unemployed youth during
the Arab Spring suggests that the lack of jobs
can be a source of social unrest, that does not
mean that the relationship between jobs and
social cohesion is straightforward, immediate,
or direct. Rather, the relationship is contextual
and shaped by individuals, their values, attitudes, and behaviors, and the institutions that
surround them. And it goes both ways: social

cohesion can also influence jobs by shaping
the context in which entrepreneurs make investment decisions.
Empirical evidence of a connection between
jobs and social cohesion is limited by data constraints, the complexity of measuring social
interactions, and the multiple factors that can
contribute to social cohesion. However, crosscountry analysis of values surveys finds that job
loss or lack of access to jobs is associated with
lower levels of trust and civic engagement. This
is not only a rich-country phenomenon, as is often suggested. Unemployment can cause depression, increase mistrust in others, and lead people
to drop out of community life. Migrants without
social ties may be excluded from job opportunities that would allow them to succeed in their
new environments. In extreme cases, if people,
particularly youth, lack jobs and hope for the future, they may turn to violent or criminal activity to compensate for the absence of self-esteem
and sense of belonging that a job might otherwise provide. Similarly, jobs offering limited opportunities for future growth or lacking access
to voice can lead to alienation and frustration.
Some jobs are positively correlated with social cohesion. Jobs that are empowering, build
agency, and provide access to voice can increase
trust and people’s willingness to participate in
civil society. Jobs can create economic and social
ties and have the potential to build incentives
to work across boundaries and resolve conflict.

	

And people’s trust in government and their confidence in institutions may increase if they believe that job opportunities are available to them
either now or in the future. Jobs can influence
social cohesion through their effects on social
identity, networks, and fairness.

Jobs can help manage social
tensions
News reports about the financial crisis and the
Arab Spring have broadcast a common sentiment that unemployment, especially among
young people, can ignite unrest and violence.1
In September 2010, a Telegraph headline reported that the “IMF Fears ‘Social Explosion’
from World Jobs Crisis” ahead of a summit
of the International Monetary Fund and the
International Labour Organization (ILO).2 In
2011, Le Monde linked jobs and social unrest
in Tunisia to concerns about social justice:
“protesters aren’t asking the Government to
find them a job, but denouncing the lack of
transparency and justice in the labor market.”3
The revolution in Tunisia was sparked by the
protests of a fruit vendor frustrated by his inability to get a permit to do his job. High levels of youth unemployment were a significant
contributing factor to the riots in the United
Kingdom in the summer of 2011.4
These events suggest that jobs can contribute to social cohesion, including how societies
handle differences and manage tensions among
different groups, and how they avoid and resolve
conflicts. There are many possible ways to define social cohesion (box 4.1). But overall, ­social
cohesion refers to the capacity of societies to
peacefully manage collective decision making.5
Social cohesion thus relates to the processes and
institutions that shape how groups interact. It
does not follow that collective decision making
should be imposed from above, but rather that
channels for voice, accountability, and inclusive
participation of diverse groups can contribute
to a cohesive society.

Trust and civic engagement matter . . .
The capacity of a country to support peaceful
collective decision making involves multiple
factors including the quality of institutions,

Jobs and social cohesion   127

intergroup relations, and the effectiveness of
channels for resolving conflicts. Cross-country
data on political stability, the absence of violence, and voice and accountability can be used
to construct an index of social cohesion at the
country level.6 The Nordic countries, Switzerland, and New Zealand, score high on this
index. Although the index is a static measure,
the capacity for peaceful decision making can
evolve over time as societies change, through
urbanization, more female employment, and
the growth of a middle class.
The nature of the interactions through jobs
affects the degree of social cohesion in communities and societies. Trust and civic engagement
are two measurable indicators of social cohesion at the individual level. These indicators are
associated with the country-level index of the
capacity for peaceful collective decision making
(figure 4.1).
Trust refers to the extent to which individuals have confidence in people whom they know
personally, including family and neighbors.7 It
can also refer to trust in people met for the first
time and in people of different religions and
nationalities.­Civic engagement captures the
extent to which people participate voluntarily
in civil society by joining community organizations, unions, political parties, or religious organizations, and by engaging in civic life. These
forms of involvement and activism include
nonviolent activity, such as participating in protests, that can be constructive for social cohesion. Civic engagement relates to social capital,
­participation, and the agency that motivates individuals to be part of collective action.

. . . and they are influenced by jobs
Trust and civic engagement can be linked to
jobs. Having—or not having—a job may affect the way people view the world by influencing their values and attitudes, including trust in
others and in institutions. Jobs can also provide
channels for people to interact across diverse
groups. Jobs with certain characteristics may
contribute more to trust and civic engagement
than others.
Not having a job is associated with less selfreported trust in high-income countries (figure
4.2a). The relationship is stronger with civic
engagement, where unemployment is linked to

BOX 4.1 

What is social cohesion?

The concept can be traced as far back as the writings of Ibn Khaldun,
a Muslim scholar born in Tunis in the 15th century, whose idea of
asabiyah is generally translated as “social cohesion.” Living during
times of manifold conflicts, Khaldun regarded asabiyah as the solidarity of small groups (tribes) that has the power to promote
broader social integration.a
Four centuries later, Emile Durkheim considered cohesion in
the context of societal transformation.b He was particularly concerned with two different types of solidarity that he observed
emerging through industrialization in Europe. Primitive societies,
he found, were marked by mechanical solidarity and a strong collective ethos based on relatively homogeneous patterns of life
and work. Advanced capitalist society, in contrast, with its complex
division of labor, was marked by organic solidarity based on merit,
respect for different roles within the labor force, and the need for
moral regulation.
More recently, social cohesion has been related to social capital.
In the 1990s, Pierre Bourdieu and others focused on the benefits
that accrue to individuals through their participation in groups and
the need for individuals to invest in these relations. Robert Putnam’s
analysis of the conditions for creating responsive, effective, and representative institutions builds on this theme. Famously, northern
Italy had more of these institutions than southern Italy, and Putnam
concluded that the central enabling condition was the existence
of more social capital, measured through the density of local
associations.c Social cohesion can be understood as a broader concept than social capital in that it considers intergroup relations in
a wider context. Easterly, Ritzen, and Woolcock define social cohesion (or lack thereof) as “the nature and extent of social and eco-

nomic divisions within society (income, ethnicity, political party,
caste, language).”d
Although social cohesion has multiple definitions with differences in focus and emphasis, some common threads emerge:

• Social cohesion is generally viewed as a positive concept. It can be
an end in itself, as well as a means. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development describes a cohesive society as
one that “works towards the well-being of all its members.”e The
French Commissariat General du Plan defines social cohesion as “a
set of social processes that help instill in individuals the sense of
belonging to the same community and the feeling that they are
recognized as members of the community.”f

• Social

cohesion relates to the interactions among individuals,
groups, and societies. These interactions are seen as “the forces
holding the individuals within the groupings in which they are”
and as linking diverse groups together.g

• Social

cohesion contributes to sustainable social development.
According to the Club de Madrid, “shared societies are stable, safe
and just and based on the promotion and protection of all human
rights . . . , including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups and
persons.”h

• Last, some definitions of social cohesion relate the concept to processes and institutional characteristics. For example, social cohesion
can refer to “the capacity of societies (not just groups, networks)
to peacefully manage collective action problems.”i This definition
links social cohesion to participation and civic engagement.

lower participation in associations and demonstrations, and signing petitions (figures 4.2b,
c, and d). With the exception of low-income
countries, the relationship between unemployment and active membership in an association
is significant and negative. The mixed findings
on trust and unemployment underscore that
unemployment may not always be a meaningful
concept in low-income countries. Open unemployment is frequently low in developing countries and is not always concentrated among the
worse-off, because most people work to make
ends meet in the absence of social safety nets.

In developing countries, the type of job, the opportunities the job provides, and the way jobs
connect people may be more relevant for social
cohesion.
Further indications of a connection between
jobs and social cohesion comes from looking
at job characteristics. The 2005 wave of the
World Values Survey asks people whether their
jobs involve manual or cognitive, routine or creative tasks, and how much independence they
have at work. An index of these self-­reported
characteristics captures how motivating a job
is. The index is positively associated with trust

in high- and upper-middle-income countries
(figure 4.3a). This relationship is not significant
in lower-middle- and low-income countries.
Holding a job with perceived cognitive, creative,
and autonomous attributes is positively linked
with civic engagement indicators in all but
low-income countries (figures 4.3b, 4.3c, and
4.3d).9 Similarly, in surveys conducted in 2012
in China, Colombia, and the Arab Republic of
Egypt, workers who perceived that their jobs
involved more autonomy and greater creative
and cognitive content were more likely to report
helping other people.10

More than correlations?
As suggestive as they are, these relationships between jobs and social cohesion do not establish
causality. While unemployed people may be less
likely to trust others or join associations, people
with less trust in others may also be more likely
to be unemployed or not participate in civil so-

ciety. Moreover, trust and civic participation are
influenced by peer and social interaction effects
(such as the trust or participation of others),
which can make it difficult to draw conclusions.
While the primary focus is on how jobs can
contribute to trust and civic engagement, this relationship goes in both directions. There are ways
in which social cohesion can affect jobs. Trust and
social capital (an element of civic engagement)
may create an economic and political environment that is conducive to economic growth.11
Trust can reduce transaction costs and overcome
market failures that arise because of uncertainty;
it can reduce costs related to search and information, policing and enforcement, and bargaining
and decision making; and it can be the basis for
the transmission and exchange of knowledge
and allow for innovation, coordination, and cooperation among firms.12 Meanwhile, factors
such as mistrust, discrimination, fragmentation
along ethnic lines, or inequality can also influence whether jobs are created, and what kind.

Note: The analysis includes 54 countries. The vertical axis shows the marginal probability (d-probit coefficient) of individuals’ self-reported trust or civic engagement on being
unemployed. The estimates control for the income, education, and demographic characteristics of respondents. Trust is based on the question, “Generally speaking, would you say
that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?” Civic engagement variables are (a) whether the respondent is an active member of
one or more of nine different associations; (b) whether the respondent attended or would attend a demonstration; or (c) whether the respondent signed or would sign a petition.
The line indicates the 95 percent confidence interval of each coefficient. If the line crosses the horizontal axis, the corresponding coefficient is not statistically significant.

Evidence of a directional link between employment status and civic engagement comes
from a survey in Indonesia that tracked participation in community meetings and volunteer
activities and interviewed the same respondents
in 2000 and 2007.13 On average, participation
in community activities increased 8 percent
during the period, but it increased at different
rates among people with different work histories (figure 4.4).14

Controlling for other factors, men and
women who were working in 2000 but not in
2007 were less likely to be participating in community activities than others. Conversely, men
and women who were not working in 2000 but
were working in 2007 were significantly more
likely to be involved in community activities
than those who were not working in 2007.15

casual relationship between employment status
and trust in others and institutions (box 4.2).16
The empirical results relating unemployment, trust, and civic engagement imply that
losing a job means more than losing income.
Job loss can undermine feelings of self-worth
and strain family and social relationships. Un-

employment can break economic and social
ties, breed mistrust, and damage people’s sense
of community and hope for the future. Not having a job can mean losing social status as well
as not being able to provide income for one’s
family. A man laid off after 24 years of work in a
factory in Serbia explained, “I automatically lost
everything. I lost any freedom and power I had.
Every­thing was lost.”17 Ethnographies of communities in Argentina, Bulgaria, and Guyana

that experienced widespread job losses in contexts of limited new job creation are remarkably
consistent in their accounts of the social implications of long-term unemployment (box 4.3).
For communities, job loss appears to foster
mistrust not only toward former employers or
government authorities suspected of being indifferent or responsible for the lack of employment opportunities but also among neighbors,
former colleagues, and friends. This frustration
may contribute to general dissatisfaction with
the political environment. An empirical study
using the World Values Survey in 69 countries
finds that joblessness can be linked with negative views about the effectiveness of democracy
and preferences for a rogue leader.18 Insecure
jobs or jobs that people find demoralizing can
have effects similar to those of unemployment.
The lack of status, job security, or voice at work
can lead people to feel disempowered and hopeless about the future and to stop participating in
social networks.19
In extreme cases, unemployment can contribute to violence or social unrest. Youth in
particular may turn to gangs or other violent
groups to compensate for the lack of ties in economic and social life.20 A longitudinal study of
youth in Ecuador found that members of gangs

Do jobs cause trust? Analysis of Eurobarometer and Latinobarómetro Surveys

An analysis using the Latinobarómetro and Eurobarometer values
surveys during the 2000s makes it possible to study the evolution of
trust and jobs and links in both directions. The surveys include questions on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions. Cohorts are
defined and examined in the different survey years. The analysis
looks at how social cohesion and employment conditions for the
cohorts evolve over time, controlling for certain country characteristics that could be correlated with both trust and employment
status.
The dataset captures important features of the formation of
social cohesion, because perceptions of trust and civic participation
are highly influenced by peer and social interaction effects. For
instance, an individual’s propensity to trust other people or the
state depends on the perceived or actual trust of others belonging
to similar sociodemographic groups.
The model simultaneously allows group level job conditions,
including unemployment and self-employment, to influence trust
and vice versa. The empirics quantify how earlier changes in grouplevel employment conditions predict their trust in society and its

institutions over time. The estimated effects measure how a percentage change in, say, the unemployment rate for a cohort in a
given year predicts changes in the percentage of individuals of that
same cohort reporting to trust in the subsequent year.
This analysis finds that increases in unemployment are followed by increases in trust among Europeans, but the opposite is
true among Latin Americans. At the same time, increases in selfemployment lead to higher trust in Europe while the opposite is
true in Latin America. These results hold in Latin America for trust
both in government and in others. Conversely, the analysis finds
little evidence of a causal link from trust to jobs, except for a small
negative impact of self-employment on trust in government in
Latin America. These results may reflect the higher coverage of
social protection in Europe and the lower importance of open
unemployment in Latin America than in Europe. They are consistent with evidence that in Latin America self-employment, while a
last resort for many unable to find wage employment, is valued by
some for the independence it provides.a

Displacement and unemployment can lead to the erosion of trust and ties

Downsizing of bauxite mines in Guyana
The downsizing of bauxite mines in the absence of new opportunities has contributed to a deterioration in family and community
relationships in Linden, Guyana.a Between the early 1970s and the
mid-1980s, bauxite mining near Linden was cut by half, and layoffs
continued throughout the 1990s. By 1999, formal unemployment in
Linden stood at about 40 percent, and residents complained of rising crime.
Once among the best-paid workers, miners were respected for
their work and seen as drivers of the economy. People felt particularly demeaned by the downsizing process: “The people off the
job don’t get any information. They treat us like we don’t exist.
Yet . . . before we came off, there used to be meetings with us,
[about] what was happening.”b
Material hardship and insecurity took a harsh toll on identity
and the relations between men and women. Women directly linked
men’s inability to retain their authority as breadwinners to domestic violence. “Especially in cases of abuse, you would be surprised
that after counseling them, the problem comes right back to the
economic situation. The man can’t provide adequately for the
home.”c Indigence was linked to shocking forms of child neglect
and abuse. Some parents were said to be prostituting their children. The cultivation of cannabis, the use of cocaine, and involvement in the international transshipment of drugs were said to be
rapidly increasing among young men.
Downsizing also diminished the economic resources available
to community organizations such as churches: “The churches are in
crisis also. As individuals, we are part of the crisis, so we carry it into
church and it in turn goes into society,” one person said.d

Regime change and unemployment in Bulgaria
Bulgaria massively downsized its unsustainable state enterprises
following the end of the Communist regime. The disappearance of

state jobs entailed the loss of numerous benefits, including health
care and job security. In focus groups, people linked job loss to poor
health, social isolation, and crime. Older men, in particular, lost face
when they had to ask young relatives or employers for work.
Unemployment did more than simply weaken social ties; it
­created distrust and mutual suspicion. The restructuring created
winners as well, and they also suffered from the mutual distrust.
People who had lost their jobs began to avoid traditional social
gatherings because they were unable to afford gifts that they were
expected to provide. People felt that security—once linked to
good health, the opportunity to pursue personal and professional
fulfillment, good personal relations, respect in the community, and
social cohesion—had moved out of reach. In communities that
were once relatively equal, people identified five or six levels of
well-being.

Economic reforms in Argentina
La Matanza is a city of 1.2 million outside Buenos Aires that was
once a manufacturing center of textiles, diesel engines, household
appliances, and steel. Economic transformations in the 1990s led to
increased reliance on technology and skilled workers. Factories in La
Matanza closed, and job opportunities became scarce. With mobility low, people had to take up temporary or casual jobs without
unemployment or health insurance. Those who managed to find
jobs complained of exploitative pay, abusive treatment, and assaults
to their dignity.
As elsewhere, job loss affected men and women’s relationships.
While some men adapted to a more egalitarian role, many re­­
sponded to the blow to their self-esteem as breadwinners with
depression or anger; women complained that violence in the
household increased. Men felt joblessness undermined their roles
in the family.

involved with drugs and guns had joined “because they were searching for the support, trust,
and cohesion—social capital—that they maintained their families did not provide, as well as
because of the lack of opportunities in the local context.”21 Similarly, analysis in the United
States has found that gangs provide youth with
the income, respect, and social ties that they
were unable to find in jobs, particularly given
the limited opportunities available in cities such
as Chicago and New York that had lost stable,
unionized manufacturing jobs.22
The lack of jobs among dislocated populations, including migrants, refugees, and dis-

placed persons, can be particularly disorienting. It can influence status and identity, for
example, for migrants who had better jobs in
their places of origin. The social effects of unemployment among dislocated populations
may be especially isolating for people lacking
family or other ties in their new communities.
It can have implications for psychological wellbeing, as well as the ability to participate in civil
society. Even migrants who find work may be
vulnerable if their jobs do not provide adequate
channels to integrate within the new society or
if the migrants lack voice or information about
their rights.

Jobs (or the lack of jobs) can shape
social interactions
The link between social cohesion and jobs is not
necessarily direct or linear. Interactions between
jobs and societies are contextual and multidimensional; effects can be positive as well as negative. Having, or not having, a job can influence
how people view themselves in relation to others,
with implications for values, attitudes, and behaviors. Jobs can connect people with information, economic activities, and other people. And
how jobs are allocated can affect whether people
think their society is fair and merit-based, believe
they have a stake in society, and have expectations and aspirations for the future (Question 4).

Jobs provide social identity
Some jobs can contribute positively to how people view themselves and their relations with others. The identity conveyed by a job can influence
the social categories that individuals associate
with, their behaviors, and the norms that shape
this behavior.23 In industrial countries, jobs that
give people opportunities to learn and develop
careers can be motivating and strengthen identity. In the United States, programs that provide
skill development and growth opportunities to
low-wage workers aim to strengthen self-esteem
and motivation.24 Public and private sector initiatives to establish career ladders in health care,

J obs, motivation, and identity in Risaralda,
Colombia

David is the owner of a small shop in one of the rural areas of Risaralda. He was
born in another part of Colombia but has lived in the region of Risaralda for
some years now. He loves living in this area for the safety and peace that exists.
He has had his shop, located next to the main street of his village, for around
15 years.
One of the things he loves the most about his job is the deep sense of
belonging to the community that it offers. When necessary, people come to his

some of his customers have left him, he does his best to help the villagers. The
income from the shop provides only enough to subsist, and it is necessary for
him to engage in other businesses so that he can have an additional income. He

there, he is able to provide for the needs of his neighbors.

child care, education, biotechnology, and manufacturing define job competencies and give employees the chance to develop skills, participate
in training, and increase their responsibility.
Results from a program implemented in nursing homes in Massachusetts in the United States
found that having opportunities for growth improved communication and teamwork, reduced
turnover, and built self-respect and confidence
among staff.25
Jobs can have similar effects for low-wage
workers in developing countries, and these effects can have implications for social cohesion.
The growth of the garment sector in Bangladesh brought more than 3 million women into
the workplace. Although the factory jobs were
physically demanding and poorly paid, they expanded women’s autonomy and increased their
opportunities to participate in public life.26 “I
am braver now,” a 26-year-old worker explained,
“I understand more things which I did not before.”27 Observers noted that the sight of women
walking back and forth to work changed popular notions about the acceptability of women in
the public space and their right to access public
institutions.28 Coworkers travel together, share
information about work opportunities, and
form savings groups.29
The effect of jobs on identity also holds
for self-employed workers, including farmers
(box 4.4). Jobs that provide access to voice can
be empowering and give workers a stake and
shared interest in their work.30 Informal workers
lack access to representation on the job and are
similarly excluded from local government and
economic associations. Associations of self-employed workers and farmers help fill these gaps.31
A core strategy of the Self Employed Women’s
Association (SEWA) in India has been to empower its members and partners by increasing
their say in communities (box 4.5).

Jobs connect people
Some jobs bring people into contact with others
whom they might not otherwise encounter, including people of different ethnicities and social
backgrounds (box 4.6). This connecting aspect
of jobs can contribute to social cohesion. Jobs
can create opportunities for repeated interactions focused on tasks leading to interdependent relationships.32 A study of political views

Voice can be extended to the self-employed: The case of SEWA

The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) began in 1972 with
a small group of migrant women cart pullers in the wholesale cloth
market of Ahmedabad City in Gujarat, India. These women worked
as head loaders, carrying clothes to and from the wholesale market.
They were paid on a per-trip basis, regardless of the distance they
traveled or the weight they carried. Often, they were not paid the
full amount they were owed because no records were kept. Ela
Bhatt, head of the Women’s Wing of the Textile Labor Association,
helped organize the group and negotiate with the cloth merchants
to gain fair treatment.
SEWA is now a member of the International Confederation of
Trade Unions and has become a model for associations of informal
workers internationally. In 2011, SEWA had more than 1.3 million
members across India, of which over 820,000 were in Gujarat, while
the rest were in eight other states. The members are drawn from
multiple trades and occupations and from all religious and caste
groups.
SEWA stresses self-reliance and promotes organizing around the
central strategies of work security, income security, food security,
and social security. Primarily a trade union, SEWA now engages in
a wide range of other areas, including leadership development,
collective bargaining, policy advocacy, financial services (savings,

loans, and insurance), social services, infrastructure, and training
and capacity building.
Of particular concern to SEWA is the fact that the working poor,
especially women, do not have a voice in institutions that set the
rules that affect them. The association seeks to expand the voice of
its members at the local level through representation and by building capacity to participate in local councils; municipal, state, and
national planning bodies; tripartite boards; minimum wage and
other advisory boards; sector-specific business associations; and
local, state, and national labor federations.
Over the past decade, SEWA has also inspired or cofounded
national and regional networks of home-workers in other parts of
South and Southeast Asia, national networks of street vendors in
India and Kenya, and international networks of domestic workers
and waste pickers. While some of these networks and organizations
remain weak, most have been able to collaborate, leverage re­­
sources, and influence policies. The regional and international networks of domestic workers, home-based workers, street vendors,
and waste pickers have secured two international conventions (for
home-workers and domestic workers) and policies, laws, or legal
judgments in several countries.

and the workplace in the United States finds that
cross-cutting interactions at work lead to greater
awareness of the rationales for views other than
one’s own and for “exposing people to political
dialogue across lines of political difference.”33 In
a survey of 200 managers, owners, and sales representatives in Trinidad and Tobago, 81 percent
of the interviewees reported that their working
lives brought them into contact with people of a
wider range of races than did their social lives.34
Interactions through jobs can contribute to
greater trust and positive interdependence between groups. In the 18th century, Montesquieu
wrote that “the natural effect of commerce is to
bring peace. Two nations that negotiate between
themselves become reciprocally dependent, if
one has an interest in buying and the other in
selling.”35 Relations through jobs, whether built
through trade or other transactions, can influence social relations.
A 2001 study of multiethnic cities in India
suggests that economic interdependence, including through jobs, can reduce the incentives
for violence between communities.36 Cities with
more interlinked economic relations were less

likely to witness ethnic violence, while riots were
more frequent in cities with fewer economic ties.
The existence of civil society organizations, such
as clubs, political parties, labor unions, and business associations, contributed to reducing violence. But economic interests provided a common motivation for community members of
both groups to participate in these associations.37
Jobs can also play a connecting role outside of urban environments. Studies in Ghana
and Uganda illustrate how farmers connected
through networks can access information and
increase productivity. In Ghana, pineapple farmers adjusted their use of fertilizer in response
to the successful or unsuccessful experiences of
their neighbors. Farmers who were starting to
cultivate pineapples were more likely to make
changes based on information they had received
from other farmers, showing the potential that
on-the-job interactions and learning from others can have.38 In a qualitative survey, youth in
Ghana who were asked about the characteristics
that would make a job attractive emphasized
the importance of jobs as opportunities to meet
new people and build social networks.39

Some jobs connect people across ethnic boundaries

Surveys carried out across the world illustrate the ways jobs can connect
people from different backgrounds.
“In Sadakhlo market in Georgia, next to the borders with Armenia
and Azerbaijan, one does not hear the virulent expressions of
mutual hatred one can hear a few miles away across the border.
‘They fight, we don’t,’ says Mukhta, a trader from Azerbaijan, while
putting his arm round his Armenian colleague Ashot.”a
“According to one of the stallholders at Ergneti market, on the
disputed border between South Ossetia and mainland Georgia,
‘There are no political questions here. The market has one language:
economic. That is it.’”b
“In Guinea, members of the Malinke ethnic group are wholesalers in the groundnut market chain, while the primary producers of
groundnuts tend to be Guerse. Malinke wholesalers and Guerse
farmers are willing to trade with each other. This is helping overcome ethnic and religious tensions. . . . This willingness to trade is
due to the mutually recognized possibility of profit.”c
“In Burma, as in Java, probably the first thing that strikes the
­visitor is the medley of peoples—European, Chinese, Indians, and

native. It is, in the strictest sense, a medley, for they mix but do not
combine. Each group holds to its own religion, its own culture and
language, its own ideas and ways. As individuals they meet . . . in the
market place, in buying and selling.”d
In ancient Cordoba, Spain, the marketplace represented “the
place of encounter over and above the gender, tribal, and faith
divides that constituted Islamic urbanization.”e
“You don’t reconcile in a vacuum. There must be a practical programme; there must be something that brings people together. As
they work together, cleaning the coffee, they talk together so they
start talking business but later they start talking family affairs. It fosters relationships and reconciliation.” f
“If I wasn’t in this job, I might have only Indian friends or African
friends,” said a sales manager for a processed food manufacturer in
Trinidad and Tobago. “But now I have plenty, plenty friends. White
friends in Mayaro. Chinese friends in Port-of-Spain. And real close.
Closer than if you born with someone, your next-door neighbor.
And that’s why I wouldn’t swap this job for anything else.”g

An experiment among farmers in rural
Uganda found that subsistence cotton farmers
using social networks can change existing social
interactions with beneficial results. The randomized intervention compared the impact of
training on agricultural productivity with the
impact of being paired with another farmer.
The pairs were encouraged to discuss farming
activities, problems, and solutions and to set a
target for increases in cultivation. The intervention encouraged exchanges of information and
learning by expanding farmer networks. Farmers who participated in the project, especially
women, significantly increased their productivity. Connecting farmers with people outside
their established social circles helped spread information that would not otherwise have been
shared.40
Jobs may not always help overcome differences and tensions between groups. While incentives inherent in jobs can provide people
with motives to interact across gender, caste,
and ethnic boundaries, these incentives may not

be sufficient to build trust or change behaviors
and contribute to social cohesion. The literature
on prejudice suggests that contact across groups
can alter people’s perceptions of others.41 There
may also be risks. If cooperation through jobs
fails, tensions between groups may flare, particularly if the groups have previously been in
conflict and blame each other.42
While networks connect people in positive
ways, they can also exclude. Surveys in industrial and developing countries consistently find
that people obtain jobs through acquaintances.
Yet, reliance on networks may have negative
social consequences if people and groups who
lack such connections are left out. In Morocco,
after controlling for education, social status, and
other factors, people whose fathers did not have
formal sector jobs were significantly less likely to
obtain formal sector jobs themselves.43 In addition to unfairness in access to jobs, family connections can also influence labor earnings. For
example, in Brazil, sons’ wages are influenced by
those of their parents.44

	

The exclusionary nature of networks is highlighted by the experience of migrants moving
from rural areas to cities. Migrants often choose
destinations where they have connections. But
if they do not, they can be uprooted from family and community ties that provide economic
and social support, including access to jobs.
They may also lack the information needed to
integrate into their new destinations. Migrants
moving across borders or regions, internally displaced persons or refugees fleeing from conflict
or returning after a peace agreement, and soldiers demobilized after conflict may be particularly vulnerable to exclusion from job opportunities. This is a concern in conflict situations as
well as in contexts of structural transformation,
when massive numbers of people move from
rural to urban areas.45 Networks also do not
reach many among the self-employed, especially
home-based workers who work in isolation and
domestic workers who lack opportunities to interact with others.

Jobs influence aspirations and
expectations
The various ways in which jobs are distributed
can affect expectations and aspirations and influence whether people believe that they have a
stake in society. The jobs that other people have
can contribute to an individual’s values, attitudes, and behaviors. Children’s goals for the future may be influenced by whether their parents
have jobs or not, as well as by the types of jobs
their parents have. Frustration and even social
unrest may develop when education and effort
are not rewarded or when people perceive the
distribution of jobs to be unfair.
The Arab Spring was as much or more
about political voice as it was about jobs. Yet
widespread disappointment, especially among
youth, about the lack of job opportunities and
frustration with the allocation of jobs based on
connections rather than merit echoed across
countries. A young person in Egypt commented,
“To work in a big company, you’ve got to have
wasta [connections; literally, a middleman]. Regardless of your qualifications, you must search
for someone to secure the job for you. In some
cases, you have to pay money.”46 Social assessments in the Republic of Yemen documented
frustration with the allocation of jobs based on
tribal, family background, or party affiliation.

Jobs and social cohesion   

Respondents at a focus group explained that,
“to get jobs, one needs someone to speak for
him, particularly from Sana’a.” Young people reported that inheriting a civil service post from
one’s father was not viewed as wrong under the
country’s civil service rules.47
Jobs that are allocated based on connections
and other circumstances beyond the control
of an individual can influence whether people
view society as fair. Recent work on the measurement of inequality of opportunities examines the extent to which access to basic services
that are essential for human development, such
as education, health, nutrition, and sanitation,
is based on circumstances of birth or arises because of inequality within society (box 4.7).48
Application of this approach to access to jobs
considers the extent to which opportunities are
related to circumstances at birth, including gender, ethnicity, and parental educational attainment and political affiliation, or to attributes,
including educational attainment and age.49 Results from 29 countries in Europe and Central
Asia indicate that inequality across groups based
on circumstances and attributes varies between
3 and 20 percent. The share of inequality attributable to circumstances is substantial in most
cases, contributing to more than half of the
overall inequality (figure 4.5).
Circumstances at birth contribute the most
to inequality in Azerbaijan, followed by Uzbekistan, Georgia, Turkey and Albania. In these
countries, such factors contribute the most to
inequality in access to jobs. Education plays an
outsized role in inequality in some countries—
Armenia stands out in particular, along with Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania.
Similar analysis for 18 countries in Latin
America using the 1990 Latinobarómetro survey confirms these findings. On the whole, the
education of the worker and the circumstances
he or she was born into play important roles
in explaining inequalities in access to jobs, and
the role of education is especially important for
regular employment in the formal sector.50

The interaction of jobs and social cohesion is not
linear or simple to disentangle. This is an emerging area for further research across disciplines.
The effect of jobs on trust and civic engagement
at the individual level suggests that exchanges

Measuring inequality of opportunities in access to jobs

The approach
The concept of equality of opportunity, which can be traced back to
John Rawls and Robert Nozick,a stems from the idea that an individual’s chances of success in life should not be caused by circumstances that are beyond the individual’s control, such as gender,
ethnicity, location of birth, or family background. John Roemer’s
1998 work formalized the principle of equality of opportunity and
argued that policy should seek to equalize opportunities independent of circumstances.b Empirical applications of this concept use
different measures of opportunity and estimate the extent to which
inequality arises because of circumstances at birth, rather than individual attributes such as effort or talent.c
The Human Opportunity Index (HOI) is one approach that is
being used across countries and regions to analyze the opportunities available to children in terms of access to basic goods and services such as sanitation, clean water, electricity, and basic education.d
The HOI captures both the extent to which societies provide these
goods and services and how equitably access to them is distributed
among groups with different circumstances in a society.
Recent work has tested the application of the HOI methodology
to jobs in Europe and Central Asia and Latin America using data
from the 2006 Life in Transition Survey and the Latinobarómetro
Survey.e In this case, opportunity is defined as having a job involving
more than 20 hours of work a week; circumstances are the gender of
the individual, the educational attainment of the father, parents’
past affiliation in the Communist Party (in Europe and Central Asia),
and self-reported minority status; and attributes are educational
attainment and age. Those lacking opportunity are people working
fewer than 20 hours a week, the unemployed, and those who want
to work more.
The HOI is the coverage rate of the opportunity, adjusted for
inequality between groups defined by circumstances and attributes.
Inequality is measured by a “dissimilarity index” (henceforth, D),
which reflects the share of available opportunities that would have
to be reallocated to achieve the same coverage rate of opportunity
across all groups. A decomposition of D indicates how much circumstances contribute to inequality between groups (relative to attri-

butes), and which circumstances contribute the most. Circumstances
can affect access to a job involving more than 20 hours of work a
week through direct and indirect channels. An example of a direct
channel is when belonging to a minority group can affect the chance
of getting a job. As for indirect channels, circumstances can influence the education of a person, which, in turn, influence the chance
of getting a job. The decomposition of D is intended to measure
the direct channel, which is to say the inequality attributable to the
predetermined circumstances, net of the effect attributed to differences in education and experience among workers.f

Caveats
A number of questions complicate the exercise and act as caveats to
the analysis. First, how should opportunity be defined in terms of
access to jobs? People have different preferences about jobs, so
part of the measured inequality may reflect voluntary choices
rather than a lack of access. And people with certain circumstances
and attributes may be more (or less) likely to be in the labor force in
the first place. Second, which circumstances should be considered?
The data only report a limited range of them, and some may simply
not be observable. Gender, minority status, and parental education
are commonly considered in the literature; and whether parents
were affiliated with the Communist Party can be a proxy for social
status in the European and Central Asian countries, even many
years later. However, parental education may be correlated with
unobserved abilities of an individual. Controlling for the individual’s
education level partially resolves this problem but does not address
the possibility that among children who receive the same education, children with educated parents may acquire better skills stemming from unobservable inputs. The methodology makes no
assumptions about missing circumstances, which are likely to exist
since information on all circumstances is not typically available
from the same survey. The inequality or dissimilarity index has the
property that the index will always increase with the addition of
more circumstances or attributes. Despite these caveats, this
approach is a first step in applying the inequality of opportunity
analysis to access to jobs.

f.	Estimating the indirect channel—the effect of circumstances through education—would be difficult because education depends on a host of factors other than the circumstances on which information is available. Moreover, excluding the impact of circumstances through education is justified because we are interested in measuring the extent to
which inequality in access to jobs is attributable to circumstances. While circumstances may have influenced educational attainment as well, these effects would have occurred
at a much earlier stage of life (primarily in childhood) and therefore do not reflect inequality of opportunities specific to jobs.

and relationships established through jobs can
have broader effects on societies, including how
they manage tensions between groups and collective decision making. But some jobs may

contribute more to social cohesion than others.
What matters is not necessarily whether people
have a job but whether the job and its characteristics can contribute to social cohesion. In

alter power relations between groups. Jobs that

QUESTION

4

Can policies contribute to social cohesion?

In Rabat, Morocco, unemployed college graduates gather daily in front of government buildings to protest the lack of jobs.51 In Juba, South
Sudan, the fledgling government faces the challenge of demobilizing 150,000 combatants and
reintegrating large numbers of internally displaced persons after conflict.52 For policy makers in countries with high youth unemployment
and in countries affected by conflict, expanding
job opportunities has urgency for social and political reasons, as well as for economic reasons.
In industrial and developing countries alike,
the conventional wisdom is that having a job is
what matters for social cohesion—how societies
peacefully manage collective decision making.
The idea that jobs can build identity, or might
be associated with trust or more participation
in society, is often seen as relevant only for a
narrow set of occupations in rich countries.
Those jobs are perceived as a luxury that developing countries cannot afford. Even those who
concede that some jobs can do more for social
cohesion in developing countries are skeptical
that policies can do much beyond supporting
job creation. Given that most employment is in
the private sector, it is unclear how or whether
the government could influence the nature of
the jobs. Some even doubt that jobs on their
own lead to greater social cohesion. They view
jobs as only one element that can contribute to
changing values, attitudes, and behaviors within
a complex web of institutional, historical, political, and social factors. Given this multiplicity of
influences, engineering social cohesion through
jobs is not an option.
Negative experiences with publicly funded
employment programs give some justification
to this skepticism. Temporary employment programs that place people into dead-end jobs with
no hope for future employment may do more
harm than good.53 Similarly, demobilization
programs in post-conflict environments risk exacerbating tensions between former opponents
through divisive targeting.54 Social cohesion
is actually undermined when jobs in publicly
funded programs are allocated to friends and
relatives of government officials, or when the

programs themselves are subject to corruption
and governance risks. These negative experiences may reveal poor program design, however,
rather than prove the impossibility for jobs policies to contribute to social cohesion.

Access to information, rights, and voice
Policies can take social cohesion into account by
expanding opportunities for groups who face
barriers to getting jobs and increasing access
to voice and rights. People may feel frustrated
if they perceive that jobs are allocated on the
basis of privilege and connections rather than
merit and achievement. Increasing fairness and
equality of opportunity for jobs involves informing the public about jobs and how to get
them, and about the existence of legal mechanisms, such as antidiscrimination laws and affirmative action programs to reduce discrimination and support the inclusion of groups who
lack access. But having laws on the books is
not enough. Increasing fairness involves institutions for enforcement, and redress mechanisms
for accountability. Although such measures can
be motivated by multiple objectives, including
poverty reduction, they can also be considered
from a social cohesion perspective.
Transparency and access to information
about jobs can increase fairness and equality
of opportunity by ensuring that vacancies are
widely publicized, together with information
about accessing public employment programs.
Access to information about rights is similarly
important for ensuring that labor practices are
fair. Farmers, self-employed workers, and workers without formal labor contracts are often not
knowledgeable about their rights in relation to
land owners, traders, local authorities, and employers, or about their options for appeals. Civil
society organizations such as cooperatives, associations of informal workers, and trade unions
can disseminate information about rights and
the channels to voice grievances.55
A related challenge is the extension of effective legal protection to those who work outside
of legal frameworks. At the international level,

	

the passage of ILO conventions on domestic and
home workers has extended coverage for these
groups (box 4.8). At the national level, countries
such as Zambia and the Philippines include legal protections of informal workers in domestic
legislation. Brazil recognizes domestic workers
within its constitution and has extended social
protection, including leave and maternity benefits to them. The country’s National Social Security Institute provides incentives for employers who register domestic workers. Although
difficult to enforce in practice, Brazil, the Czech
Republic, the Philippines, and South Africa
have established minimum wages for domestic
workers.56
Similarly, migrant workers tend to fall outside legal frameworks. Both sending and receiving countries can adopt measures to extend legal
protection. The government of the Philippines
has a mechanism to protect its overseas workers. The government provides them with predeparture information and support services; it
has also signed bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding recognizing migrant
workers’ rights with receiving countries. The
government has also promoted voluntary social
security schemes for overseas workers.57
The existence and quality of institutions for
accountability can influence the extent to which
rights are enforced in practice.58 Legal frameworks rely on the ability of labor ministries, inspectorates, and courts to handle disputes and
hold the parties accountable. Most countries allow labor disputes to be heard in special labor
courts or civil courts. But court proceedings
can be lengthy, costly, and cumbersome. In response, some countries have established alternative procedures for dispute resolution, including
conciliation, mediation, and arbitration before
court hearings.59 Cambodia introduced an Arbitration Council in 2003 to help manage labor
grievances and improve industrial relations in
the growing garment sector (box 4.9).

Antidiscrimination policies
Legal mechanisms such as antidiscrimination laws and provisions for affirmative action
can facilitate access to jobs for groups who
are excluded from opportunities or suffer from
stigma. Most countries have equality guarantees
within their constitutions, generally covering

 omestic workers: The journey to an ILO
D
convention

Domestic work includes cleaning, cooking, gardening, child care, and elder
care. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 52.6
million domestic workers worldwide; other estimates are nearly twice as high.
Women, generally from the poorest sections of society, make up over 80 percent of domestic workers.a Many are migrants, and child labor is common,
especially for girls. Domestic workers, and especially migrants, are excluded
from labor and social protection laws in most countries.
Domestic workers have long tried to be recognized and included in the
labor laws of their respective countries. In 2006, domestic worker organizations
began to organize internationally with the support of international trade
unions and nongovernmental organizations representing informal workers.
Their main demand was recognition and access to rights, including a campaign
for an ILO convention on labor rights for domestic workers.
The campaign involved extensive coordination at the country level to
mobilize workers and gain support from labor ministries, trade unions, and
employers’ associations. As a result of this campaign, the minimum wage for
domestic workers was raised by 10 percent in Jamaica, and a memorandum of
understanding was signed to improve the conditions of Indonesian domestic
workers in Malaysia.
In 2011, the ILO adopted the Domestic Workers Convention and the Domestic Workers Recommendation. The convention states that domestic workers are
to be covered under national labor laws and regulations, including those
related to social protection programs.
The process of securing an ILO convention contributed to building the
capacity of organizations and individual leaders and gained domestic workers
associations status with trade unions. It also created better conditions for recognition and enforcement of rights. In March 2012, the government of Singapore announced that it would require employers to give one day a week off to
the country’s 206,000 domestic workers, most of whom come from Indonesia,
the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and India.b

the obligations of the state. Guarantees are often complemented by laws addressing job segregation, unequal pay, prejudice in recruitment,
harassment at work, and lack of education and
training.60 Affirmative action programs involve
proactive measures for hiring women, minorities, and other groups subject to exclusion.61
Such programs can be mandatory or voluntary
and apply to the public or private sectors.
Affirmative action programs can work, but
pitfalls are many. Evaluations yield mixed results.62 The most extensive research is from the

Cambodia’s garment sector

The garment industry is Cambodia’s largest formal sector employer. By mid2008, the sector had more than 300 factories, with nearly 340,000 workers, 90
percent of whom were women. Labor conditions including low wages, excessive overtime, poor occupational health and safety, child labor, and antiunion
practices emerged as a major issue as the sector expanded. The initial response
was passage of a new labor law in 1997. Enforcement was poor, however. The
Labor Inspectorate lacked credibility; inspectors were underpaid and underresourced, and were seen as subject to influence. The courts were perceived as
corrupt and unresponsive to the needs of workers or employers. As a result,
strikes and demonstrations increased, and major international brands raised
concerns about the viability of operating in Cambodia.
In this context, Cambodia concluded a 1999 bilateral trade agreement with
the United States. Building on a similar clause in other trade deals, the United
States agreed to increase Cambodia’s import quota for garments if a semiannual review showed that progress had been achieved in adherence to core
international labor standards and standards set in Cambodian law. Following
the agreement, the United States funded two International Labour Organization (ILO) projects to support the implementation of this clause. The first, which
became known as Better Factories Cambodia, involved monitoring working
conditions in garment factories.
The second program established an Arbitration Council to prevent and
resolve labor disputes. The council’s 30 part-time members were nominated
through a process facilitated by the ILO and endorsed by unions, employers’
organizations, and government. The council conducts mandatory but (generally) nonbinding arbitration of collective labor disputes that cannot be resolved
through mediation by the Ministry of Labor. Most disputes handled by the
council involve compliance with labor law related to wages, bonuses, benefits,
and working conditions. Some cases also relate to rights, including antiunion
practices, gender equality, freedom of association, and collective bargaining.
Since its establishment in 2003, the council has heard more than 1,200 disputes, 70 percent of which are reported as successfully resolved. Opinion surveys indicate a high level of confidence in the council’s independence and
effectiveness. In 2010, the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia
and major union federations agreed to switch to the council’s arbitration procedures for disputes over existing labor rights. The result has been an upsurge
in the rate of awards issued by the council and a decrease in the rate at which
parties are filing objections. Strikes per factory have fallen to their lowest level
in 10 years.

ing, and on-the-job training.63 Evidence from
developing countries is more limited. In South
Africa, affirmative action supporting blacks,
women, and people with disabilities was complemented with incentives for firms, including
access to licenses and contracts. An evaluation
found that programs had limited impact on
reducing gaps in employment and wages but
narrowed differentials at the top of the wage
distribution. This finding suggests that the pro-

gram might have assisted individuals who were
already higher up on the skills ladder but not the
average previously disadvantaged individual.64
Hiring quotas for underrepresented groups
can be enshrined in constitutions, as is the case
for Scheduled Castes and Tribes in India and for
Bumiputras in Malaysia. Both countries have
shown that quotas work well but can become
politicized.65 Quotas supported through specific
programs have been successful. In Bangladesh,
for instance, where women’s employment rates
were extremely low, the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest put in place
a 30 percent quota for women. This doubled
women’s participation in the program within a
year, with participants reporting a high level of
satisfaction.66

Jobs policies can shape social identity and
connect people
Access to jobs can bolster self-esteem and produce benefits for societies beyond incomes.
Programs that support employment for at-risk
populations, including youth, can take into account the ways in which jobs affect peoples’ attitudes, values, and behaviors and contribute to
improved relations between groups. Arguably,
in countries with high youth unemployment,
targeted training programs have the potential
to be designed to strengthen self-esteem, which
can lead to greater community involvement
and reduced crime and violence. The evidence
remains limited and tentative, but emerging
findings from some training programs targeted
to youth, including those in post-conflict settings are somewhat encouraging.
The Northern Uganda Social Action Fund
suggests that combining vocational training,
life skills, and counseling can increase community involvement and reduce aggression among
youth in a post-conflict setting (box 4.10).67 A
reintegration and agricultural livelihoods program for high-risk Liberian youth led to a modest increase in social engagement and a reduction in illegal activities. Participants were also
less interested in recruitment into violent activities in neighboring Côte d’Ivoire. The program
had no clear impact on reducing aggression
and violence, however.68 An evaluation of the
Juventud y Empleo program in the Dominican
Republic found that a combination of voca-

	

tional and life-skills training for unemployed
youth can reduce involvement in gangs and delay teen pregnancy.69 This is an area for further
research; evidence is thin, and few evaluations of
employment and training programs incorporate
social cohesion outcome measures such as community participation and conflict resolution.
Temporary employment programs can provide skills training and access to employment
for youth at risk and vulnerable populations,
particularly during crises and after conflicts.70
These programs have a mixed record in supporting employability, because they generally involve
jobs with low status that rarely lead to future
earnings opportunities. But there are indications
that programs can be designed to invest in skills
with benefits for social cohesion. El Salvador’s
Temporary Income Assistance Program targets
women and youth in areas with high rates of
violence. Early results suggest that the program
has increased the self-esteem of beneficiaries and
reduced the recurrence of violence. 71
Public works programs frequently rely on
community participation to identify local projects, providing forums for collective decision
making. Community meetings can bring together people affected by conflict and crisis (box
4.10). In Rwanda, meetings for the country’s
public works program discussed peace building,
security, community development, and reconciliation, in addition to project-related issues. In
the Republic of Yemen, fuel shortages and price
increases in building materials stalled public
works activities in 2011. However, communities worked together to find creative solutions to
these obstacles, including using local materials
and finding alternative modes of transport.72
Participatory aspects of programs can provide a channel for voice of excluded groups. In
a survey of participants in Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program—which at 7.6 million
beneficiaries is one of the largest public works
programs in the world—two-thirds of respondents said that the project had given them the
first opportunity ever to be involved in a local
meeting. Many participants had not interacted
with local government officials prior to the
program.73
Employment programs partnering with the
private sector can connect people through jobs.

reduce social tensions

Opportunities for youth in Northern Uganda
Two decades of insurgency, instability, and conflict led to high rates of poverty
in northern Uganda. By 2005, a measure of peace and stability had returned to
the region, allowing for the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and other war-affected populations. In 2006, the government launched
the Youth Opportunities Program to stimulate income generation and employment growth among young adults ages 16 to 35. The program provided cash
grants for vocational training and business materials to groups of participants
with successful grant proposals. Groups had an average of 22 members, and
most expressed interest in tailoring, carpentry, metal works, mechanics, or
hairdressing.
An evaluation two years after the intervention found increased investments
in skills, participation in skilled work, greater incomes, and higher savings.
Grantees were 4 percent more likely to attend community meetings and 9
­percent more likely to be community mobilizers. Participants also reported
receiving more social support from their family and the community. Furthermore, men who received grants reported a 31 percent decline in aggressive
behavior relative to the control group. This finding is consistent with theories
that link aggression to stress levels, low social standing, and perceived injustice—all potentially alleviated by higher employment and incomes.

Public works in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province
In Sri Lanka, a cash-for-work program initially established to re­settle 100,000
returnees following internal conflict actually assisted more than 250,000
returnees and quickly evolved into one of the largest sources of employment in
the Northern Province.
Participants noted that in many cases the program meetings were the first
community-level gathering that they had attended after having arrived from
camps for internally displaced populations. By many accounts, community
meetings, shared meals, team work, and the involvement of elders and children as indirect beneficiaries of the program promoted a sense of belonging
among the newly resettled families.
Sachchithananthan Subodhini, 36 years old, from Thervipuram in the
Puthukkudiyiruppu Division of the Northern Province said that she was “very
happy. As a result of cash for work, the whole village is working as one; for our
own community and village.” Reflecting on her life journey since being displaced in 1995, she said that the program “had helped to bring the community
together. . . . [T]he village seemed abandoned but the shramadana [volunteer
work] helped to get the community back to its original state.”

Development Report 2013 (Sri Lanka).

entrepreneurial skills. Students are mentored by
professors and private sector coaches to develop
business plans. The initial results of the program
show that the program motivated students and
gave them confidence to take risks. A male participant from Tunis explained, “I have become
more independent. My behavior has changed. I
use my new skills, I am more disciplined.” Stu-

dents also explained that the program expanded
their professional networks by giving them opportunities to interact with mentors. “I now
have a social network. I know whom to consult,”
explained a female participant.74
While not all jobs affect social cohesion,
those that shape social identity, build networks,
and increase fairness, particularly for excluded
groups, can defuse tensions. Increasing fairness
in the allocation of jobs and at work can also be
important for social cohesion. Measures that
support inclusion, extend access to voice and
rights, and improve transparency and account-

ability in the labor market can improve equity.
They can also increase the extent to which
people perceive that they have a stake in society.
This perception can be especially critical when
risks of social unrest from youth unemployment
and conflict are high. While policies with weak
governance or divisive targeting can undermine
social cohesion, well-designed programs may
have positive effects. Jobs policies for youth at
risk can incorporate counseling and training in
conflict resolution. Public works programs can
facilitate community participation and engagement between citizens and local governments.

of the economic backwardness in the world can
be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”

covered participation in a community meeting;
cooperative, voluntary labor; neighborhood im-

provement; neighborhood watch (men); or women’s association. These trends were likely driven
by a set of factors, including political changes after
1998 that created more space for community dialogue and the decentralization of public services
starting in 1999; the introduction of multistakeholder forums for consultation on budgeting
(the Musrenbang) in 2004, which included village
meetings; school based–management initiatives
that require parental involvement; and the scaling
up of development programs that explicitly promote community participation.

explicitly promoted community participation

conditional cash transfer program, Program
Keluarga Harapan) usually have some community participation component.

a job can lead to withdrawal from associational
life. Getting laid off even once, especially if it occurred during a person’s prime working years, resulted in “enduring, substantively and statistically
significant lower probabilities of social involvement over the life course,” particularly in church,
youth, and community groups. See Brand and

What are good jobs
for development?

Introduction to Part 2

E

arnings, benefits (if any), and overall job
satisfaction are what matter to individual
jobholders. Those earnings and benefits—tangible or otherwise—are the first and
most direct measure of the value a job has to society. But jobs may also affect others, positively
or negatively. Jobs for women may influence resource allocations at the household level and
benefit their children. Jobs connected to world
markets may lead to knowledge spillovers and
make other workers more productive. Jobs that
provide opportunities may convey a sense of
fairness to others and help them remain engaged. Spillovers like these have been the focus
of recent thinking on development. The analysis
may be organized around concepts such as gender, urbanization, or conflict; but much of the
action happens through jobs.
Quite often individual and social perspectives
on jobs coincide; but not always. For instance,
jobs with perks and benefits may be highly
coveted by individuals, but they may be less
valuable to society if their privileges are supported through government transfers or restrictive regulations, undermining the earnings or
job opportunities of others. Because of gaps
like these, jobs that look equivalent from an individual perspective may be different from a social
perspective. The contributions jobs make to society should be assessed by taking into account
the value they have to the people who hold them,
but also the potential spillovers on others—
positive or negative. Good jobs for development
are those with the highest value to society.
Conversely, some forms of work are unequivocally bad. A set of universal rights endorsed by governments, international organizations, and others seeks to eliminate forced
labor, harmful forms of child labor, discrimi-

nation, and the suppression of voice among
workers. These forms of work should not be
considered jobs.
How jobs contribute to living standards,
productivity, and social ­cohesion varies with
a country’s level of development, its demography, its endowments, and its institutions. Jobs
agendas are thus inherently country specific.
By combining the various features of an economy, however, it is possible to build a typology
of jobs challenges. It includes agrarian economies, conflict-affected countries, urbanizing
countries, resource-rich countries, small island
nations, countries with high youth unemployment, formalizing economies, and aging societies. Because the nature of the challenges varies,
what makes a job good for development in one
context may not be so relevant in another. And
in some circumstances, tradeoffs emerge. The
jobs that do the most to defuse tension in the
short term may not do much for productivity,
or those with the highest productivity impact
may not lead to a broad-based improvement in
living standards. Identifying good jobs for development helps visualize these tradeoffs.
Different countries face different jobs challenges, but two forces—the migration of people
and the migration of jobs—connect their jobs
agendas. These two flows have an impact on
countries at the sending and the receiving ends.
The arrival of migrants or the outsourcing of
jobs affects the living standards of both migrants
and locals. The availability of foreign workers,
the development of migrant networks channeling savings and ideas, and the arrival of multinational firms bringing in more advanced
techniques, are all bound to increase productivity. Family structures and community life are also
affected by the movement of people and jobs.

Valuing jobs
Jobs are often assessed from an individual perspective. But they can also
affect the earnings, productivity, and well-being of others—positively
or negatively. These spillovers should be assessed too.

T

he most important impact of jobs is on
the people who hold them. Jobs provide
earnings, can give access to benefits and
insurance, and are often a source of broader life
satisfaction. Development, in large part, consists
of increasing these direct effects of jobs on
individuals.
Beyond the importance of jobs for those
who have them, jobs matter for societies because they can affect the earnings, employment
opportunities, and the productivity of others,
as well as the collective capacity to manage tensions. Jobs can also contribute to shared social
objectives, such as poverty reduction, environmental protection, and fairness. Often, the
­individual and social values of jobs are similar;
but these two perspectives may differ. For instance, Vietnam’s poverty rate declined with
unprecedented speed in the 1990s when land
was redistributed to farmers and agricultural
commercialization was liberalized.1 Albeit increasing individual incomes, farming jobs involved difficult working conditions, substantial
variability in earnings, and no formal social
protection. But they made a major contribution to the development of Vietnam. Bloated
public utilities, on the other hand, often offer a
range of privileges to their employees even
when the utilities themselves provide only limited coverage of the population and unreliable

services, and are obstacles to economic growth
and poverty reduction. Such jobs may look appealing from an individual perspective—but
less so from a social perspective. Good jobs for
development are those that make the greatest
contribution to society, taking into account the
value they have to the people who hold them,
but also their potential spillovers on others—
positive or negative.
Recognizing the multiple effects of jobs
is important for understanding the possible
trade­offs they entail. Some jobs greatly contribute to productivity growth but do not lead
to poverty reduction in the short run. In other
cases, jobs are urgently needed to avoid an unraveling of social cohesion, but the job creation
that can be immediately supported using public funds is unlikely to result in rapid productivity growth. An understanding of the various
effects of jobs on aggregate well-being, both
direct and indirect, may help identify when a
virtuous circle of jobs along all three transformations may arise, and when a vicious circle
looms.
The value of a job for the person who holds it
is a primary indication of its development payoff. But assessing the broader value the job has
to society also requires information on the spillovers the job may have on the living standards
of others, on aggregate productivity, or on social

cohesion. Data from household, plant-level, and
values surveys, as well as qualitative assessments,
can be used to determine the existence of relevant spillovers. Although quantifying all the
gaps between the individual and social values
of jobs may not be possible, identifying where
these gaps lie can help make policy trade­offs
transparent. The analytical tools to do so can be
borrowed from several disciplines in economics
and the social sciences. These disciplines often
focus on spillovers from jobs, without necessarily calling them that.
While some jobs may contribute more to
development than their individual values suggest, some forms of work are likely bad from any
point of view. All countries have subscribed to
a set of universal rights. Most governments, as
well as international organizations and others,
have ratified or endorsed standards seeking to
eliminate forced labor, harmful forms of child
labor, discrimination, and the suppression of
voice among workers. Thus, some work activities are widely viewed as unacceptable and
should not be treated as jobs.

BOX 5.1 

Rights as the foundation
While jobs can be transformational, some
forms of work are harmful. Those that exploit
workers, expose them to dangerous environments, or threaten their physical and mental
well-being are bad for individuals and societies. Their negative effects can be surprisingly
long-lasting. An extreme example is the impact
of the Atlantic slave trade on West Africa. A
study found that individuals whose ancestors
had been threatened by slavery were less likely
to trust relatives, neighbors, and local governments even more than 100 years after the end
of the slave trade.2 Today, international norms
of human rights and labor standards reject
forced labor, harmful forms of child labor,
discrimination, and the suppression of voice
among workers. Yet close to 21 million people
globally are estimated to be victims of bonded
labor, slavery, forced prostitution, and other
forms of involuntary work.3 In 2008, 115 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 were
involved in hazardous work (box 5.1).4

Children do perilous work in artisanal gold mines in Mali

Much artisanal gold mining in Mali is village based and focused on
alluvial deposits that require panning for separation. Although child
labor tends to be relatively controlled in Mali, an estimated 20,000
to 40,000 children, some as young as age 6, work in artisanal gold
mining.a Human Rights Watch has documented the perilous nature
of this work:
“They dig shafts and work underground, pull up, carry and crush
the ore, and pan it for gold. Many children suffer serious pain in their
heads, necks, arms, or backs, and risk long-term spinal injury from
carrying heavy weights and from enduring repetitive motion. Children have sustained injuries from falling rocks and sharp tools, and
have fallen into shafts. In addition, they risk grave injury when working in unstable shafts, which sometimes collapse.”b
The work is toxic because miners use mercury to separate the
gold from the rock. Mercury poisoning can cause serious neurological disorders, vision impairment, headaches, memory loss, and
problems with concentration. Often, the children themselves are
aware of the dangers:

“It’s my stepmother who makes me work there. I don’t want to.
My real mother left. My stepmother takes all the money they pay
me. . . . I don’t get any money from the work. . . . Our work starts at
8 a.m. and continues the whole day. . . . I take the minerals [ore] and
pan them. I work with mercury, and touch it. . . . He said mercury was
a poison and we shouldn’t swallow it, but he didn’t say anything
else about the mercury. . . . I don’t want to work in the mines. I want
to stay in school. I got malaria, and I am very tired when I work there
[at the mine].”
—Mariam D., estimated age 11, Worognan, Sikasso Region,
April 8, 2011c
“It’s dangerous—there are often collapses. People are injured.
Three died in a cave-in. The little children don’t come down into the
hole. . . . I have had problems since working there—my back hurts
and I have problems urinating. No one says anything to me about
safety.”
—Ibrahim K., age 15d

At the international level, the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights
of 1948 establishes that “everyone has the right
to work, to free choice of employment, to just
and favorable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.” These rights are
further elaborated in international conventions
and regional frameworks and are translated into
domestic laws.5 The global agenda for workers’
rights became focused on four fundamental
principles and rights in the workplace in 1998.
Back then, a vast majority of members of the International Labour ­Organization (ILO) signed
a declaration covering a core set of labor standards on the elimination of forced and compulsory labor, the abolition of child labor, the
elimination of discrimination in employment
and occupation, and freedom of association and
collective bargaining.6 Other ILO conventions
cover a range of related subjects including working time, social security, occupational safety and
health, and labor inspections.7
International law requires that countries
bring their domestic laws into compliance with
the international legal instruments the countries
have ratified. The core labor standards have a
special status among ILO conventions because
the 1998 declaration requires all ILO member
states to “respect, promote, and realize” the standards, regardless of whether they ratify specific
conventions.8 The standards influence other instruments for protecting workers’ rights through
references in national and regional legislation,
the texts of many bilateral free trade agreements,
the procedures of international organizations,
and corporate codes of conduct.9 International
legal frameworks arguably do not cover some
fundamental rights. The core labor standards,
for example, do not directly address working
conditions including safety and health.10
Gaps remain between rights on paper and
implementation in practice (box 5.2). Even in
countries that have ratified the core labor standards and have laws on the books, children work
in harmful conditions, discrimination happens
in access to jobs and in pay, forced labor persists,
and freedom of association is limited. Commitments in treaties, conventions, and laws may not
change the institutions, practices, and behaviors
that affect workers’ rights on their own. A key
factor driving these gaps is the fact that many
workers are not covered by laws. For example:

• Many labor laws and regulations cover only

workers in formal employment relationships, limiting the extent to which workers
can appeal to legal mechanisms. The growing involvement of agencies in hiring workers complicates legal accountability because
temporary workers often have contracts with
employment agencies, which, in turn, enter
into the contracts with the actual employers.
Often, such workers would not count against
legal minimum employment levels at which
labor rights become binding. 11

• Some labor laws deliberately exclude domes-

tic workers, family workers, or workers in
small enterprises.12 Exclusions can also apply in export zones and other areas where
regulation is suspended to attract investment.
Unpaid family workers in agriculture and enterprises, including children on family farms,
may also be excluded. Many women perform
non-remunerated work of this sort.13

• Tensions may also exist between labor rights

defined in national and international contexts
and customary, religious, and indigenous laws.
Many countries are characterized by legal
pluralism, whereby multiple legal systems exist side by side. Overlapping jurisdictions are
most common in the case of family law relating to marriage, divorce, and inheritance.14

Gaps between rights on paper and those
in practice underscore a substantial agenda to
eliminate unacceptable forms of work. Nonstate
actors, including private employers and civil
society organizations, are increasingly involved
in efforts to improve compliance with labor
rights and standards. Multinational corporations
and industry associations often adopt codes
of conduct, voluntary standards, and monitoring and auditing strategies.15 Nongovernmental
organizations monitor factories and firms, provide training and education to workers, and coordinate domestic and global campaigns. While
this heightened involvement in rights and standards does not guarantee that implementation
will improve, it provides potential channels and
partnerships for increasing accountability for
rights at work.

	

Valuing jobs   

BOX 5.2 

C
 ompliance with core labor standards is partial

The number of countries that have adopted the eight core labor
standards included in the International Labour Organization’s 1998
Declaration of the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work is
steadily increasing. But compliance gaps with the four principles—
child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and freedom of association
and collective bargaining—are still apparent.a
Child labor. ILO conventions 138 and 182 require countries to develop
and monitor action plans regulating work by children under age 18.
Convention 182, covering the most harmful forms of child labor,
has been ratified by 175 countries. The largest numbers of children
in hazardous work are in East Asia and the Pacific, but across regions
there is evidence that progress is being made.b Brazil and India are
among the countries showing improvements. In Brazil, between
1992 and 2008, employment among 7–15 year olds fell over 10 percentage points, from 18 percent to 7 percent. At the same time,
school attendance rose from 85 percent to 97 percent. In India,
­children’s employment fell from 8 percent to nearly 4 percent, and
school attendance rose 14 percentage points (from 72 percent to
86 percent).c
Forced labor. More countries have ratified conventions 29 and 105,
the core standards on forced labor, than the other core standards.
An estimated two-thirds of forced labor takes the form of economic
exploitation; one-fifth is linked to forced labor imposed by the state
or the military; and the remainder involves commercial sexual
exploitation. This last form disproportionately affects women and
girls.d The long-term effects on individuals, families, and communities can be severe. Nongovernmental organizations that rescue victims of forced labor, particularly forced commercial prostitution,
find that post-traumatic stress, social stigma, and disease can cripple reentry into society.e
Discrimination. Conventions 100 and 111 refer to discrimination by
gender, ethnicity, disability, or other status as a source of disparities
in access to jobs, segregation within the labor market, pay gaps, and
harassment or violence at work. From a legal perspective, discrimination can be understood as inequality before the law within either
the formal legal system or customary law. It results from unequal
treatment on the grounds of race, gender, religion, political opinion,
national extraction, or social origin; or the unequal impact of policies, practices, or rules. Employment outcomes are affected by each
of these layers of discrimination.f Although progress has been made
in removing legal obstacles that affect women’s access to jobs, barriers remain.g Labor laws in 44 countries restrict the hours that
women may work,h and 71 countries impose legal limits on the
industries in which women may work. Such restrictions have often

deprived women of equal access to jobs. Inequality in laws relating
to marriage, inheritance, and property ownership, as well as traditional and customary laws, also affect the access of women to productive assets and business opportunities.
Discrimination in employment may be the outcome of policies
not dealing directly with labor issues. For example, in some countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Roma children are often tracked
into schools intended for children with special needs, which provide
limited opportunities for further advancement in education and
subsequent employment. Roma graduates of special schools in the
Czech Republic were twice as likely as non-Roma graduates to be
out of the labor force.i A study of Roma in the Czech Republic found
that 19 percent of Roma ages 10–19 had attended a special needs
school, while the share in the non-Roma population was 7 percent.
The figures in the Slovak Republic were 12 and 8 percent
respectively.j A 2007 court case involving Roma students in the
Czech Republic noted that they were more likely to be placed in
schools for the mentally challenged than non-Roma children. The
European Court of Human Rights ruled that this overrepresentation
violated nondiscrimination protections in the European Convention
on Human Rights.k
Freedom of association and collective bargaining (FACB). Although
conventions 87 and 98 are among the oldest of the core standards,
they have been ratified by fewer countries than the others. These
conventions cover the right to establish and join organizations and
call for mechanisms for negotiations between employers and
worker organizations. FACB are “enabling rights” in that they give
workers voice to advocate for other aspects of working conditions,
including safety and health.l
FACB is curtailed in countries where unions and other associations are banned, where associations face restrictions on their activity, or where members are threatened by violence or repression.
FACB rights of both workers and employers are monitored by the
ILO Governing Body’s Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA),
a universal monitoring mechanism that functions in addition to
the ILO’s regular supervisory mechanisms for monitoring ratified
conventions. The CFA handles complaints related to civil liberties,
including murder, abductions, disappearances, threats, arrests, and
detentions of trade union leaders and members, as well as other
acts of antiunion harassment and intimidation and violations of
freedom of assembly and freedom of expression.m Convention 87
protects the rights of all workers, including the self-employed. In
practice, however, implementation of FACB is limited because many
workers are employed outside traditional employer-employee relationships or do not work in occupations or sectors that are covered
by formal unions.

The value of jobs to individuals
and society
The most obvious outcome of a job is the earnings it provides to the worker. These earnings
can be in cash or in kind and may include a range
of associated benefits. The earnings the job provides, as well as the output it generates, typically
increase with the skills of the worker. Improving skills is thus one of the most direct channels
to enhance the value jobs have to individuals
and society (question 5). Other characteristics
of the job may also matter from the point of
view of individual well-being. Stability, voice,
and fulfillment at work all play a role in overall
job satisfaction, as do any detrimental impacts
of jobs on mental and physical health through
stress and anxiety.16
Several of these dimensions of jobs have been
combined into the concept of decent work introduced by the ILO in 1999 (box 5.3). Since then,
many governments have used it to articulate
their policy agendas on jobs. The concept of decent work has also been embraced by the United
Nations and several international organizations
and endorsed by numerous global forums.

BOX 5.3 

A job may also matter for others, beyond its
holder. When asked about their most preferred
jobs, survey respondents from four diverse
countries provide different answers from those
they offer when asked about the most important jobs to society (figure 5.1). They frequently
mention working in the civil service or as a shop
owner as the jobs they would prefer for themselves, while identifying teachers and doctors
as the most important jobs for societies. China
is the only country where a job in civil service
is seen as more important for society than for
the individual. In the Arab Republic of Egypt, a
job as a teacher is more valued individually than
socially. And in Sierra Leone, being a farmer is
appreciated both individually and socially, while
in the other countries it is recognized as socially
valuable but is not a preferred job.
This intuition can be developed into a more
structured analysis of the reasons why some jobs
may be more or less valuable to society than they
are to those who hold them. Those reasons can
be grouped under three main headings, each
corresponding to one of the three development
transformations. Individual jobs can improve
the living standards of others in society, or they

The concept of Decent Work and the Decent Work Agenda

Decent Work is defined as “opportunities for women and men to
obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom,
equity, security and human dignity.”a This definition is based on a
broad concept of work as encompassing all forms of economic
activity.b The International Labour Organization has made Decent
Work for all the organizing principle for its activities and has set
an agenda for incorporating the goal of Decent Work for all into
national strategic planning objectives.c The ILO’s Decent Work
Agenda is a policy approach based on four strategic objectives: fundamental principles and rights at work and international labor standards, productive and freely chosen employment, social protection,
and social dialogue.
At the global level, the ILO has defined Decent Work indicators
to measure the different dimensions of the concept and to track
progress over time. In 2010, the United Nations (UN) Summit on the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) included a new target
under Goal 1 (eradicate extreme poverty and hunger): “achieve full
and productive employment and Decent Work for all, including
women and young people.”d The Decent Work indicators are being

used to help countries measure progress and establish priorities. A
limited set are used to monitor progress toward the MDG target.e
The ILO’s Decent Work Agenda includes a threshold below
which no job should fall. The threshold has four components: productive employment (not simply any job), basic social protection
according to national conditions, opportunity for voice and organization, and rights at work. As an incremental agenda, Decent Work
indicators can change, depending on the economic, social, and
institutional progress of countries.
This ILO agenda has gained considerable traction and international political buy-in over the past decade. First formulated at the
International Labour Conference in 1999, it is now part of the ILO
constitution and has been endorsed by heads of state at the UN General Assembly, the Group of 20, and regional authorities such as the
European Union, the African Union, the Organization of American
States, the Association of South East Asian Nations, and the Southern
Cone Common Market (Mercosur). Many countries use the Decent
Work concept to define development targets, identify policy priorities, and measure progress toward meeting specified goals.

can adversely affect their earnings and employment opportunities. They can help raise the
productivity of others, or they can harm them
through their environmental impacts. And they
can support more peaceful collective decision
making, or, alternatively, increase social tensions
when they are based on privilege.

Spillovers from jobs
Good jobs for development are those with the
highest payoff to society. As a first approximation, the value of the job for the person who

holds it provides a good measure of the value of
the job to society. But some jobs also have spillovers on the living standards of others, on aggregate productivity, or on social cohesion. When
spillovers are positive, the job has a greater value
to society than it has to the person who holds
it, and the opposite is true when the spillovers
are negative. In principle, the spillovers can also
be negligible, in which case there is no real distinction between the individual and the social
perspective. Nonetheless, the idea that jobs can
have sizable spillovers is at the core of several disciplines in the social sciences and has greatly influenced recent development thinking (box 5.4).

BOX 5.4 

Economics and the social sciences deal with spillovers from jobs, under different names

Several disciplines in economics and in the social sciences focus on
the channels through which spillovers from jobs occur, even if they
may not articulate it that way. One core focus of labor economics is to
assess earnings differentials and their causes, including discrimination, uneven bargaining power, regulation, and taxation. The public
finance literature also evaluates the impact on employment, capital
intensity, and earnings of taxes and subsidies, including those used
to finance social insurance contributions. Gender studies examine
the economic, social, and cultural determinants of gender discrimination and their relationships to employment. Poverty analyses
study the poverty and inequality impact of job distributions and
­different growth patterns. Economic geography uncovers the productivity impact of spatial concentration of jobs. International economics a­ nalyzes the resource allocation and innovation impetus
provided by employment in export sectors and foreign-owned
companies. Environmental economics measures and values the negative (and positive) impacts of employment in different sectors, or
using different techniques, on the natural resource base. Identity
economics researches how behaviors and norms are influenced by
the relationship between people and their peer groups, including
through their jobs. The field of equity analysis has started to examine

the degree to which job outcomes are shaped by the circumstances
in which individuals are born, as opposed to their ability or effort.
Finally, ­conflict studies aim to identify the societal conditions that
underlie tension not being managed constructively and peacefully,
including access to jobs and fairness in their allocation.
These disciplines bring analytical rigor to the assessment of the
gaps between the individual and social values of jobs, hence to the
identification of good jobs for development.a
Although they may not be explicitly articulated around jobs,
these disciplines have shaped recent development thinking. The
World Development Report 2007: Development and the Next Generationa shows that opening job opportunities for young people is
­catalytic for future economic and social development. The World
Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography discusses
reaping the benefits of agglomeration, which happens through
jobs, as a source of economic growth. The World Development Report
2011: Conflict, Security, and Development makes the point that jobs
are a key element for stabilization in post-conflict societies. And the
World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development
provides evidence that jobs are a medium to promote gender
equity and transform it into social and economic progress.

Fully valuing the contribution jobs make
to development requires identifying the channels through which the spillovers may occur.
Nine of them have received attention as critical
for development (figure 5.2):

or inadequate regulation may result in labor
earnings that are either too low or too high
relative to the output generated by jobs. This
distortion affects the earnings of the employer
and the job opportunities of other workers.
Taxpayers may also be affected when jobs are
supported through transfers. Jobs that do not
tax others, literally or figuratively, do more for
development.

• Household allocations. Having a job and con-

tributing resources to a household’s budget
can change the status of the jobholder and
increase his or her say on how the budget is
allocated. If the jobholder is a woman, spending on food and on children may increase,
which may result in greater well-being for the
children. Jobs that empower women have the
potential to generate such positive spillovers.

• Poverty

reduction. The well-being of others may be affected if they are altruistic and
value poverty reduction in general, even when
their own earnings do not change. Since jobs
are the main avenue out of poverty, there is

	

Valuing jobs   

social value in the availability of jobs that take
others out of poverty. Employment opportunities tilted in favor of the poor do more for
development.

• Agglomeration

effects. Productivity depends
not only on the internal efficiency of economic units but also on their environment.
Learning and imitation through labor turnover and interaction with suppliers, as well
as a better matching of skills across a bigger
pool of workers, can increase productivity. Hence, jobs in functional cities tend to
be good jobs for development. Conversely,
negative effects can arise in overcrowded and
congested cities.

• Global integration. Knowledge spillovers also

occur through international trade and parti­
cipation in global value chains. Firms that engage in export markets tend to become more
productive and, in doing so, they push other,
less productive firms out of business. Know­
ledge spillovers from foreign direct investment (FDI) increase aggregate productivity.
Jobs that connect to global markets are thus
good jobs for development.

• Environmental effects. Jobs have negative im-

pacts on aggregate productivity when they
damage the environment or lead to an overuse of scarce resources. But they can also have
positive effects on the environment, as in the
case of jobs to manage forests and other common resources. The social value of a job cannot be assessed without taking into account
its environmental impact.

• Social identity. Jobs can impact the well-being

of others by influencing the values and behavior of those who hold them in ways that affect
society at large. Jobs can shape the norms that
influence how the jobholder interacts with
others, starting with basics such as reliability,
punctuality, and courtesy. Depending on their
characteristics, jobs can foster civic engagement and result in greater trust.

• Networks. Jobs connect people to each other.
They convey information among coworkers
and society more broadly. They impact the
integration of rural migrants in new urban
settings. Jobs may also contribute to tolerance
when they increase interactions with people
from different social and ethnic backgrounds.

• Sense of fairness. A perceived absence of fair-

ness in the overall access to job opportunities, beyond one’s own job, can undermine
the sense of belonging. Job allocations at
odds with the idea of equality of opportunity may lead to disengagement from collective decision-making processes. Jobs that live
up to standards of transparency and merit
contribute to the sense of fairness in society.

Because a job can affect the well-being of
others and not only the well-being of the jobholder, two jobs that may appear identical from
an individual perspective could still be different
from a social perspective. In a society that values
poverty reduction, an informal job that takes a
household out of poverty should be seen as more
valuable to society. A job in a protected industry
that needs support through transfers (either
by taxpayers or by consumers) is less valuable
to society, and even less valuable if the need for
protection is associated with the use of outdated
technology that results in high environmental
costs. The opposite holds for a job in an export
industry that contributes to the acquisition of
new technical and managerial knowledge from
abroad and spreads it through interactions with
suppliers; this job is even more valuable to society when the jobholder is a woman and her
work status empowers her. And the same is true
for a job that gives a young person a sense of belonging in society and conveys to others a sense
of opportunity (figure 5.3).
The contribution jobs make to development varies, depending on the circumstances.
In low- and middle-income countries, poverty
reduction carries significant weight. Productivity effects vary: heavily urbanized and highly
connected countries such as Singapore have
internalized a large part of these effects already,
while urbanizing countries such as Bangladesh
and Guatemala are still able to reap significant
benefits. Jobs in illegal mining can cause environmental damage, and their net contribution
to productivity growth is limited as a result. Jobs
in Turkey’s wind energy parks, in contrast, likely
contribute to all three transformations in a positive way: they offer earnings and job satisfaction
to workers; they position Turkey at the forefront
of technological developments in new energy;
and they often contribute to social cohesion by
creating new livelihood opportunities for villages.

More often than not, however, jobs entail
tradeoffs. A specific job can entail positive and
negative spillovers simultaneously. Take, for example, a job that requires relatively low-skills
but that uses outdated technology and hence
causes environmental damage. From a social
point of view, such a job has a positive spillover
because it leads to poverty reduction, but it also
exhibits a negative spillover through its environmental effect. Similar tradeoffs can exist for a
job that connects the domestic economy globally but that has been obtained through connections, thereby decreasing the sense that the job
market is fair.
Such tradeoffs can take strategic dimensions: in China, the nature and location of investments in roads have different implications
for jobs. The investments yield their highest
growth returns in the eastern and central regions of China, where the most productive jobs
are. But their contribution to poverty reduction
is greatest in the western regions, where living
standards are lower.17 In such situations, societal choices are necessary. Assessing and mapping spillovers is an important first step toward
informed decision making.

Can the development payoffs from
jobs be quantified?
Earnings from labor provide the first and most
direct measure of the contribution jobs make
to development. But transformations in living standards, productivity, and social cohesion happen at a faster pace when jobs lead to
investments in children, give people the possibility to acquire new skills through their work,
or engage them more in society. Because these
transformational aspects are seldom reflected in
labor earnings, good jobs for development may
not be as attractive to individuals as they are important to society. This is why, even in a context
of full employment, there may not be enough
jobs for women in many developing countries,
or enough jobs connected to world markets, or
enough jobs for idle young men. Spillovers are
thus especially relevant in countries where gender equality is far from assured, urbanization
and global integration are incipient, and conflict
is still a possibility.
Fully valuing the development payoffs from
jobs entails assessing the earnings they provide,
as well as their possible spillovers. In practice,

BOX 5.5 

Several data sources can be used to quantify the development payoffs from jobs

Household surveys such as those used for poverty analysis are
a critically important input for assessing the contribution jobs
make to society. Regular up-to-date, high-quality data on activity,
employ­ment, and earnings can be used to understand employment
dynamics. Many countries around the world collect household data
through living standards surveys and labor force surveys. Social
security administrations in countries with a high coverage rate of
social programs record information about their contributors. Unfortunately, few countries trace employment histories. Such histories
(including employment transitions) are vital to achieving an understanding of how long young jobseekers are unemployed, whether
unemployment scars the middle-aged, or how internal migration
supports rural families.
Plant-level surveys are another standard input to understand
the dynamics of job creation and destruction and their implications
for aggregate productivity. Many countries conduct such surveys
out of a sampling frame supposed to capture all units in manufacturing; in some cases, the coverage extends to units in other sectors,
such as trade. Other countries collect data on production and
employment through administrative records; the information is less

detailed on inputs and therefore has limited potential in the estimation of changes in productivity, but it gives a more comprehensive
picture of how firms are born, grow, decline and die and how
employment evolves as a result. Unfortunately, only a few countries
collect information on the myriad microenterprises in the informal
sector. This information is vital to understanding where job creation
occurs in the economy and where it contributes most to aggregate
productivity.
Special household surveys inquiring about values and attitudes,
together with qualitative assessments, are important instruments for
assessing links between jobs on the one hand and beliefs and behaviors on the other. These surveys often provide information on trust in
others and civic participation, and on the characteristics of respondents and their jobs. Information from these surveys can be combined with living standards and labor force surveys to identify population groups at risk, and analyze how jobs are associated with
peaceful collective decision making. Observing individual or cohort
groups over time allows for an exploration of possible causal links
among jobs, trust, behaviors, and attitudes.

this amounts to identifying the gaps between
the individual and the social values of jobs (if
any) that are relevant in a particular country
context. Such an evaluation requires data, some
of which many countries are now collecting
on a more or less regular basis (box 5.5). Using
data to measure the full social value of a job
calls for rigorous analysis too. Patterns in the
data may result from spurious correlations, and
the related conclusions may be tainted if individuals and firms with fundamentally different
characteristics selected themselves into specific
jobs or activities. Labor economics, productivity studies, and other social sciences have developed analytical tools for the analyses required.
Sociological and anthropological methods can
provide texture and context missing in quantitative data. In some cases, randomized trials or
natural experiments can shed light on the
mechanisms at play. But methodological pitfalls
abound, so the safest approach is to triangulate
the available evidence.

Living standards
Three types of spillovers can enhance or undermine the direct contribution jobs make to liv-

ing standards: jobs can impact the earnings of
others, they can alter the allocation of resources
within households in a substantial way, and they
can contribute to shared social goals such as
poverty reduction.
Earnings of others. Jobs in subsidized firms and
in bloated public sector agencies have an impact on the earnings of others, as they lead to an
excessive tax burden and a reduction of earnings (or the disappearance of jobs) elsewhere
in the economy. Jobs characterized by uneven
bargaining power between employers and employees, or discrimination against women or
ethnic minority groups, have earnings that are
too high or too low relative to the output generated by the job.
The tools of public finance can be used to
assess gaps between the individual and the social values of jobs in the case of jobs supported
through transfers. Taxation and government
spending affect earnings and modify incentives
and thus have an impact on resource allocations,
including employment. Analyses of the tax burden applying to capital and labor, assessments
of cross-subsidization between individuals or
firms, or evaluations of the impacts of payroll

163

164  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

taxation can identify a gap between the individual value and the social value of a job.
A tax wedge does not necessarily imply that
the individual and the social value of a job differ, or that employment effects are large. The
methodological pitfall to avoid in this case is to
assume that individuals attach no value to the
taxes or contributions they pay. If workers value
social security contributions as an entitlement
to deferred benefits, their net burden is lower
than the contribution rate suggests. If they value
the contribution in full, there would be no misallocation of resources. In some systems, con­
tributions and benefits are closely linked; in
others, the link is looser and redistribution
stronger. But even when benefits are low compared to taxes, the effects on employment depend on how much of the taxes employers can
pass on to employees through lower wages. In
the extreme case, when the number of workers
seeking wage employment is fixed, the entire tax
is paid by workers, and employment is the same
then as without a tax.18 In Turkey, a reduction in
social security taxes would result in higher net
wages and lower total labor cost only partially,
thereby moderating the change in employment.
The effect is somewhat higher, though, for lowerskilled workers earning around the minimum
wage.19
The tools of labor economics can be used to
measure the gaps between the actual earnings of
specific groups of workers and the earnings they
would have in the absence of uneven bargaining
power or discrimination. Earnings functions (a
standard tool of labor economics) can provide
an estimate of the magnitude of those gaps.
Actual earnings are lower than they otherwise
would be in the case of women, ethnic minorities, and people working in the agricultural sector; they tend to be higher in the case of union
members. Some gaps diminish with economic
development, others persist (figure 5.4). On the
surface at least, the gender and occupational
gaps show no sign of disappearing.
While these exercises are informative, earnings gaps may result from differences in the
characteristics of jobs or workers not accounted
for in the analysis. Gender gaps can stem from
discrimination but also from choices about the
work-life balance. Union gaps may signal strong
bargaining power but could also reflect higher
productivity of organized workers. Rural pay
deficits may be affected by unobservable dif-

ferences between the workers who migrated
to the cities and those who stayed behind. So,
even when the gaps are rigorously measured,
disentangling the reasons behind them is an
important step before policy conclusions can be
drawn.
Household allocations. Who holds a job can
matter for how household earnings evolve and
are spent. Job opportunities for youth are particularly important. A difficult transition from
school to work can lead to scarring—a negative
impact on long-term earnings prospects, hence
of future household expenditures. The risk of
unemployment later in life is higher for those
with difficult school-to-work transitions.20
Jobs that go to women might also benefit other
members of society as well as the woman holding the job. Women generally have lower labor
force participation rates than men and typically earn less than their male counterparts, but
employment outside the household often empowers them.21 A body of evidence has found
that spending decisions depend on the share
of household income contributed by different
members of the household. Women’s control
over household resources leads to more spending on food and children’s schooling.
The impact womens’ employment has on
household allocations can be quantified using
standard tools in poverty and gender analyses.
In Mexico, for example, higher women’s income
shares were associated with more food and children’s clothing and less alcohol.22 Similar results
were observed in Bangladesh, Côte d’Ivoire,
and South Africa.23 In the Republic of Congo, a
higher female share in total household income
was associated with significantly higher expenditures on food and significantly lower expenditure on clothing for adults and entertainment
(figure 5.5).24 However, it should not be assumed
that impacts are the same everywhere. Providing
cash transfers in Burkina Faso boosted routine
preventive care for children, regardless of which
parent received the money.25 And evaluations in
Ghana and Sri Lanka show that microcredit was
invested to a larger extent into a business by men
than by women.26
Another approach looks directly at the impacts of women’s employment on human development outcomes, such as children’s educational attainment and health. In a rural setting in
southern India, an increase in annual female in-

Poverty reduction. Job opportunities and employment transitions are major determinants of
changes in both individual living standards and
overall poverty in a country. If societies value
poverty reduction, a job lifting an individual or
a household out of poverty increases the wellbeing of others. A spillover exists then, as aggregate welfare increases beyond the increase in

escaping poverty.
The way new job opportunities are distributed is of major importance for poverty reduction. Poverty profiles, revealing the characteristics of the poor, help identify which types
jobs—and in which locations—would make the
biggest difference to them. Microsimulations using household survey data allow estimating the
impact of changes in employment on poverty
rates. For instance, increasing the employment
rate is of highest priority in Bulgaria and Latvia,
two aging countries. Consider the poverty alleviation effects of raising the employment rate by
3 percentage points depending on who, among
those currently not working, gets the additional
jobs. If the jobs went to the people whose individual characteristics make them more easily
employable, poverty would fall by 1.1 percentage points in Bulgaria and by 1.2 percentage
points in Latvia. If new employment opportunities instead went to the most employable among
the poor, poverty would fall by 4.7 percentage
points in Bulgaria and by 4.1 percentage points
in Latvia (figure 5.6).

	

Productivity
Spillovers from jobs on the productivity of other
jobs can happen through three main channels.
Jobs in functional cities lead to greater specialization and mutual learning. Jobs connected to
global markets allow for the acquisition of more
advanced technological and managerial knowledge. And through the production process in
which they are embedded, jobs can have negative—or positive—effects on the environment.
Agglomeration effects. The spatial concentration of activity is a strong driver of productivity
growth in developing countries. Effects can materialize within sectors (localization economies)
or between sectors (urbanization economies).
The sharing of inputs, better labor matching,
and knowledge spillovers are the main forces
behind the geographical concentration of industries and economic activity in urban environments. The sharing of inputs facilitates the
emergence of specialized producers of intermediate goods and services. Proximity allows firms
to more easily find workers to fill positions.
Knowledge spillovers allow firms to learn about
new technologies, products, and practices from
other firms operating in the vicinity. These agglomeration effects signal a difference between
the private and social values of jobs.
The tools of urban economics can be used
to assess the potential gains from agglomeration. In industrial countries, as city employment increases by 10 percent, wages and firm
productivity in the city grow by 0.2 to 1.0
percent.30 To give a sense of the magnitudes
implied, if wages and productivity were to increase by 0.3 percent, workers moving from
a city with 5,000 inhabitants to a metropolis of
5 million would see their earnings increase by
23 percent.31 Nonetheless, not all workers bene­
fit equally from living and working together in
cities, nor do they contribute equally to productivity growth. Workers with better cognitive and
social skills tend to benefit more.32 Workers also
enjoy higher wages when they are surrounded
by a more educated labor force.33
The association between urban scale and
productivity has also been documented in many
developing economies, including Brazil, China,
India, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and
Turkey.34 In Taiwan, China, a 10 percent increase
in total manufacturing employment in a locality

causes employment in specific industrial sectors
to increase between 3.0 and 7.5 percent (figure
5.7).35 Enterprise surveys also show that firms
grow faster in large cities.36 In many developing countries, however, the poor functionality
of cities undermines the potential gains from
proximity. Inefficiencies in labor, land, and
housing markets may cause poor functionality
in cities. Poor functionality may also result from
deficits in transportation and communication
infrastructure, especially for smaller cities where
market access is critical.37
But agglomeration can also come with higher
costs, from more expensive land to worse congestion and pollution in cities with 1 million to
3 million people. In the United States, between
1980 and 2000, the number of annual hours per
person lost to traffic delays increased from 4 to
22.38 Traffic in central London moves at only
11 miles an hour.39 In Mexico City, the annual
cost of traffic delays amounts to US$580 a person, or 3 percent of annual per capita income.40

concentrations of 10 parts per billion would increase worker productivity by 4.2 percent. 42
Analytical tools from the management literature can be used to assess the impact of industrial
clusters on productivity.43 In many low-income
countries, industrial clusters account for a large
share of manufacturing employment, including self-employment.44 Clustering is more common in light manufacturing industries intensive
in unskilled labor, such as garments, footwear,
furniture, and metalworking. The formation of
a cluster often starts with a pioneer, typically a
former trader or engineer who is able to identify a new, profitable business. Success leads to
imitation, and a large number of relatively small
and similar enterprises emerges in the vicinity. The management literature can help identify dynamic clusters, where jobs have positive
spillovers.
Global integration. The fragmentation of production across borders is one of the most notable
features of the global economy.45 Value chains

through arms-length trade or through intrafirm
transactions. Global integration improves domestic resource allocation because it puts greater
pressure on firms to be competitive. Exporting
allows the most productive firms to grow. But
in doing so, they also exert pressure on the least
productive ones to contract or exit. Global integration also generates knowledge spillovers.
These arise through exposure to new technologies embodied in traded goods or through
new management practices in companies receiving FDI. Knowledge spillovers take place
horizontally, between competitors, and vertically, through buyer-supplier relationships.
International economics has devoted considerable efforts to quantifying the productivity impacts of global integration. In Colombia,
productivity increased faster at the plant level
during the trade liberalization period than during the import substitution period.46 In India,
industry restructuring immediately following
the trade reforms of 1991, including the entry
and exit of firms, contributed significantly to
productivity increases.47 In Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire,
and Turkey, the lowering of trade barriers led to
a reduction of markups—a sign of intensified
competition.48 Productivity-enhancing effects
of exports have been found in China; Indonesia;
Korea; Slovenia; and Taiwan, China, as well as at
the regional level in East Asia and Sub-Saharan
Africa.49
A specialized literature focuses on the knowledge spillovers and productivity impacts of multinationals and FDI. In Indonesia, when a plant
switched from domestic to foreign ownership,
its total factor productivity increased by 13.5
percent within three years. In Brazil, wages of
incumbent workers in domestic firms were positively affected by the share of workers who previously worked with multinationals. In Ghana,
firms whose owners worked for multinationals
in the same industry were more productive than
other domestic firms.50 In developing countries,
the knowledge spillovers from FDI may be more
important than their impact on resource allocation (figure 5.8).51
Research can help assess whether the knowledge spillovers from global integration trickle
down to small informal enterprises through
value chains. Larger enterprises are more likely
to become suppliers to foreign companies or
to be directly acquired by multi­nationals. But
they tend to contract out noncore businesses

	

Environmental impacts. Jobs that overuse natural resources or damage the environment are
less productive than their direct output might
suggest. The environmental damage they create
imposes a negative spillover on others, resulting
in a lower net contribution to aggregate output.
Natural resources such as the atmosphere, water, forests, and soil provide services useful for
economic activities and necessary for human
life, but they are often overused because their
cost from a private point of view falls short of
their true social cost.55 The emission of greenhouse gases is an example of a negative spillover.
The tools of environmental economics can
be used to quantify the cost of emissions associated with jobs. Worldwide, industry is responsible for over one-fifth of carbon emission.56
Globally, the average cost from fuel combustion
in manufacturing is in the order of US$82 per
job per year.57 However, this average hides an
enormous diversity in the emission cost of production across countries, industries, and technologies. Across countries, a negative relation
can be observed between the annual emission
cost per job and the emission efficiency of production. Richer countries tend to have higher
environmental costs associated with one job,
but, in parallel, these jobs have a high productivity so that the emission intensity per unit of
manufacturing output tends to be relatively low
(figure 5.9).

provides opportunities for small and microenterprises to also reap the benefits of knowledge
spillovers.52
Research can also shed light on the obstacles
preventing the productivity spillovers from globally integrated jobs from materializing. Crosscountry analysis shows that the degree of labor
market flexibility, barriers to firm entry, and infrastructure development substantially influence
the impact of openness on growth.53 Knowledge
spillovers hinge on the ability of the local economy to absorb them—human capital and research and development capacity are important.
Local firms need a certain level of production
and technological capabilities to be selected as
suppliers by foreign companies. When technology gaps between local firms and foreign companies are large, productivity spillovers are less
likely to occur.54

Note: CO2 = carbon dioxide; GDP = gross domestic product. Estimates are based on data from the International Energy Agency and methods and emission factors from the revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The figure considers only CO2

manufacturing GDP in constant prices.

Policies to contain carbon emissions and reduce environmental damage rely on price and
quantity instruments aimed at transferring the
cost to producers. These policies should increase
net output per job, accounted for in green terms.
However, in the short term, they could result in
fewer jobs if natural resources and labor are
complements in production.
Policies also try to promote job creation in
more environmentally friendly industries. Jobs
in enterprises that produce wind mills for electricity generation, construct water and soil conservation systems, and plant and manage trees
fall in this category. These are often called green
jobs, with different definitions attached to the
term. Industries matching the most common
definitions of green jobs tend to be relatively
small in many developing countries, with Brazil
and China notable exceptions (box 5.6).58
Pending a precise quantification of environmental spillovers from jobs, it is likely that the
activities with the greatest potential to mitigate
adverse environmental damage in develop-

BOX 5.6 

International definitions of green jobs can be too narrow for developing countries

While the concept of green growth is well developed, there is less
consensus on the concept of green jobs.a The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) uses this label for
jobs linked to environmental industries.b The European Commission focuses on employment in industries whose products are
deemed beneficial to the environment.c Examples include jobs in
renewable energy sectors and low-carbon manufacturing. Several
national governments are developing their own definitions of
green jobs, both for statistical purposes as well as to inform policy
making.
The United Nations Environment Programme defines green
jobs as “positions in agriculture, manufacturing, construction,
installation, and maintenance, as well as scientific and technical,
administrative, and service-related activities that contribute
­substantially to preserving or restoring environmental quality.”d
For the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Labour Organization, these jobs must also qualify as Decent
Work.

But these definitions can be too narrow. In developing countries,
some jobs associated with green growth that have prospects for
substantial expansion, such as biofuel and biomass production, may
not qualify as Decent Work.e Moreover, the focus on renewable
energy and low-carbon manufacturing may shift attention away
from activities with positive environmental impacts that also provide higher earnings to the poor.
Consider efforts toward reduced forest degradation and sustainable management of trees.f Tree resources outside of closed forests
are becoming increasingly important to satisfy the demand for
charcoal, firewood, timber, and nonwood forest products. Locally
managed reforestation and regeneration of degraded landscapes
may generate income opportunities for poor people as well as positive environmental impacts. Trees with the capacity to fix nitrogen
have been used to improve soil fertility and provide fodder, wood,
and fuel. Such enhanced tree management has helped increase sorghum yields by as much as 85 percent in some areas and millet
yields by as much as 50 percent.

ing countries lie outside the modern sector, in
areas such as agriculture and forestry management. Agriculture and deforestation account for
nearly 30 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in the world.59 Low-productivity agriculture leads to deforestation as cultivated areas
are expanded.60 As such, efforts to reduce the
environmental spillovers from jobs in developing countries are bound to concern rural areas,
affecting farming and rural livelihoods.61 For
example, they may involve community participation in the management of commons such as
forests and natural habitats.

Social cohesion
If jobs change values, behaviors, and attitudes of
people, they can influence how societies function, specifically, how groups in society are able
to resolve tensions and engage in peaceful collective decision making. Three such spillovers
from jobs to social cohesion are social identity,
networks, and a sense of fairness. The effect of
jobs on social identity can be particularly im-

portant for youth. Jobs can contribute to socialization and the process of acquiring values and
behaviors for the workplace and society.62
Social identity. A job can influence the social
groups that individuals associate with, their
behaviors, and the norms that shape those behaviors.63 The degree to which a job, or its characteristics, shapes the way individuals perceive
themselves in their community and society
varies with traditions, culture, and the level of
economic development. But when the relationship is significant, a spillover from jobs to social
cohesion exists.
Quantifying spillovers from jobs on social cohesion is bound to be more difficult than for living standards or productivity. However, a rough
assessment is possible using household surveys
as well as qualitative studies. For instance, about
half of respondents in China judge their jobs to
be somewhat or absolutely meaningful, but in
Sierra Leone the share is 90 percent, potentially
signaling the social importance of jobs in a lowincome and post-conflict setting.

Behaviors and norms can also be changed
by perceptions about access to jobs—by raising peoples’ expectations and aspirations for
the future—and in some cases these changes in
perceptions can be gauged as well. For instance,
school enrollments in Bangladesh increased
among girls after garment factories opened
within commuting distance of their villages.64
No such effect was observed among boys, while
some older girls dropped out of school to take
up the new job opportunity (figure 5.10). As
jobs in the fac­tories became available to women,
it is likely that parents saw more employment
opportunities for their daughters and realized
the importance of education. The women working in these garment factories thus set an example for other women and girls.
Program evaluations are another source of
information on the spillovers from jobs on social
cohesion. For instance, the Programa Juventud
y Empleo (Youth and Employment Program) in
the Dominican Republic reaches young people
who have not finished secondary school, are
unemployed, and are living in poor households.
Participants receive a combination of vocational training and training in life skills, including self-esteem, teamwork, and communication
skills, followed by internships at private sector

firms.65 The program has led to a decrease in
involvement in gangs, violence, and other risky
be­havior, including drug use and unprotected
sex. Participants described the positive impact
on their self-esteem and behaviors.
Networks. Jobs can create new contacts and be a
vehicle to transmit information. On the negative
side, they can also have an exclusionary effect,
moving the individual further from the wider
society. Positive network effects can give people
a stake in their community or society; negative
effects can increase social distance.
Again, surveys can inquire about these dynamics as a first entry to gauge whether a spillover exists. In four countries, participants in a
survey were asked whether their job was useful
or not in establishing contacts with other people,
providing information about societal matters or
other jobs, or helping with news about good
deals (on food, for example). Only a quarter of
respondents in China, but fully three-quarters of
those in Sierra Leone judged these network effects to be at least somewhat important (figure
5.11). While comparisons across countries need
to be interpreted with caution, comparisons
across individuals in the same country may be
informative.

the World Development Report 2013.

Quantitative methods are necessary to contextualize network effects. Surveys in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have found that the number
of people willing to work or do business with
someone of a different ethnicity was greater
than the number of people in favor of interethnic cooperation in schools or neighborhoods.66
Focus groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the
late 1990s found that the workplace was “the
area in which there is the greatest support for
ethnic cooperation.”67 Business people working in print and packaging, food and beverages,
construction, and retail in Trinidad and Tobago
have reported that interactions through work
with others of different ethnicities have positively influenced their social life.68
Sense of fairness. Whether access to jobs is fair
naturally depends on a subjective evaluation.
Opinion surveys can provide an assessment
of how fair the job market is judged to be, and
tracking such evaluations over time can be of
guidance to policy makers. About 30 percent
of Chinese respondents feel that the mostqualified people get jobs—an indication that rel-

atively few people judge jobs to be distributed on
the basis of merit. In Colombia as well as ­Sierra
Leone, the percentages were significantly higher.
Beyond these subjective assessments, fairness
in access to jobs can actually be measured rigorously, building on the emerging literature on inequality of opportunity. This literature explores
to what degree factors beyond talent and effort
matter in accessing jobs. These factors include
the circumstances in which a person is born:
location, family background, gender, ethnicity, and language.69 A society that offers equal
opportunities would record little influence of
these circumstances on job trajectories much
later in the life. In some countries, however, the
share of inequality that arises from such birth
circumstances is large. In this case, the existence
of deeply rooted inequities determines the life
chances from early on and becomes apparent
later on through the access to jobs and the related rewards.70 The approach can also be used
to assess the importance of different factors that
contribute to inequality in employment opportunities. Among several countries in Eastern and
Central Europe, father’s education is a driver for
inequity in access to jobs, especially in the Rus-

The assessment of the social value of jobs is
important for the identification of what good
jobs for development are in a particular country context. Such assessments can be pursued

with a variety of means. Some of them allow
for an actual quantification, some others for a
qualitative treatment of the difference between
the individual value and the social value of jobs.
Assessing the social value of different types of
jobs can inform policy discussions about trade­
offs and priorities for developmental policies.
The relevant spillovers are bound to be different
in countries at different levels of development
and with different characteristics, thus leading
to diverse jobs agendas.

QUESTION

5

Skills or jobs—which comes first?

Since human capital theory first established a
link between skills and economic performance,
it generally has been held that education and
training are wise investments for increasing employment and earnings—and are hence necessary ingredients for growth and job creation.
The risk of living in poverty declines with the
acquisition of basic cognitive skills, especially
numeracy and literacy, and the associated enhancement in earning opportunities. Skills, especially cognitive abilities, are strongly related
to productivity growth, more so than school attendance rates.71 They also are closely associated
with structural transformation, especially for
low- and lower-middle-income countries where
they create opportunities for people outside of
agriculture.72 Across 1,500 subnational regions
in 110 countries, education emerges as the critical determinant of knowledge spillovers and
entrepreneurship.73 And skills can shape how
jobs link people to neighbors, communities, and
societies.74
But around the world, available skills are not
fitting well with the demands of the economy.
Skills mismatches are arguably growing rather
than shrinking. Albeit not easy to pinpoint, up
to one-third of the employed in countries as diverse as Brazil, Costa Rica, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
and Tanzania are either under- or over-qualified
for the work they do.75 Managers of registered,
formal firms around the world judge workforce
skills as an obstacle of above-average importance in the production process.76 In countries
at all development levels, skills obstacles are also
judged to be more acute now than in the first
half of the 2000s (figure 5.13).
Skills shortages are an especially serious constraint for the most dynamic entrepreneurs.77
Larger as well as younger and growing firms
tend to identify skills as a constraint more than
medium-sized and smaller firms.78 Exportoriented firms in Indonesia and the Philippines
report skills bottlenecks more than firms producing for the domestic market in those countries.79 Across 106 developing countries, firms
that adopt technology more rapidly and those
that are more globally integrated take longer to

fill job vacancies through external candidates
than other firms—a sign of skill-related constraints being more binding.80 On the other
hand, farmers and entrepreneurs of unregistered
firms in both rural and urban environments
tend to rate skills bottlenecks as less severe.81
The straightforward response to such mismatches would be for private firms or individuals to upgrade skills through further education
or training—but several well-known reasons
prevent this from occurring. Firms and farms—
especially smaller ones—and workers seldom
have the necessary funds nor can they borrow
for this purpose.82 Firms are also reluctant to invest in training employees for fear that workers
will leave after being trained.83 And both firms
and workers may lack the information needed
to identify skills gaps.
Because of such market failures, policy makers often turn to education and training systems
to deal with high unemployment or stifled productivity growth. Many countries are currently
making a big push to hone the skills of the
current and soon-to-be workforce through increased emphasis on on-the-job training and on
pre-employment (vocational) education. Turkey’s Public Employment Agency has expanded
vocational training enrollment almost tenfold
since 2007, delivering close to 250,000 courses
in 2011. India has launched the National Skills
Mission with a stated goal of training 500 million people by 2022.

The pitfalls of skills building
The importance of skills cannot be overstated (box 5.7). But caution is needed before
jumping from this recognition to the launching of large skills-building programs. The root
cause of skill shortages or mismatches might
not lie with the education and training system.
Shortages and mismatches may instead result
from wrong signals generated by market distortions and institutional failures elsewhere in the
economy. If a civil service career pays overly well,
young people may study to obtain such jobs,
even if they need to queue for them. This can

BOX 5.7 

How skills are formed, and how they can be measured

Skills are acquired throughout life. People learn, adapt, and form
their skills through a multitude of interactions and mechanisms
within the household and neighborhood, during the formative
years of schooling, at work, and in training. Cognitive skills include
verbal ability, working memory, numeracy, and problem-solving
abilities. Social skills are based on personality traits that underlie
behaviors such as teamwork, reliability, discipline, or work effort.a
Technical skills enable the performance of specific tasks. Because all
jobs require a combination of skills that are formed in multiple ways
and in diverse circumstances, policy makers face complex challenges in forging the best path for skills development.
The first months and years of life are the most crucial for skill formation. This is when intelligence and learning abilities, the foundations for the development of core cognitive and social skills, are
cemented.b Brain maturation occurs in steps, with new skills building on earlier ones. If the foundation is strong, higher-order cognitive and social skills can be added later on. This leads to higher
adaptability in rapidly changing job environments and the acquisition of job-specific techniques. In the slums of Mumbai, a special
program run in parallel to primary schooling raised children’s self-

esteem, self-efficacy, and aspirations, increasing scores on schoolleaving examinations and initial labor market outcomes.c But while
foundations are laid early on, skills are also shaped after childhood
and in working life.
Attention to the measurement of skills has gained prominence
worldwide. Achievement tests provide infor­
mation for parents,
instructors, and administrators, and enable a better understanding
of systemwide performance and achievements. While the skills
measured on these tests appear to be purely academic in nature,
test scores reflect more than individuals’ cognitive skills. A good
part of the variation in achievement tests can be attributed to personality traits or social skills as well as to incentive systems. These
personality traits and social skills are critical in predicting individuals’ life outcomes, including educational attainment and earnings.
More recently, efforts have gone in the direction of assessing
adult competencies, by measuring the variety, intensity, and frequency of skills used in the workplace. These measures range from
assessing different types of manual and workplace skills of a more
routine manner to complex capabilities, such as problem solving
abilities.d

lead to the acquisition of skills that are irrelevant
in the private sector and to unrealistic expectations, as was observed, for example, in the Arab
Republic of Egypt.84 Similarly, compressed pay
scales reduce the incentives to invest more in
education and training.85 Lack of information
about employment opportunities, transportation costs, or housing market failures may be the
real reasons why workers do not take available
jobs. In all of these cases, constraints that seem to
be skills related actually reside outside the education and training system.
Besides, the successful delivery of skills-building services is difficult. Pre-employment and
on-the-job training show varying success in the
developing world. On-the-job training is consistently found to go hand-in-hand with higher
labor earnings and productivity increases, even
more so in developing than in industrial countries.86 But only a fraction of workers have access
to it; those with less education and those working in smaller and informal enterprises seldom
have the opportunity to benefit from training.
Technical and vocational education (TVE) has
a mixed record: compared with general education, TVE led to higher earnings in Rwanda, Sri
Lanka, and Thailand, more or less equal earnings in Indonesia and India, and lower earnings
in Pakistan.87 The reach of TVE in rural areas is
often very limited.88 In some countries, TVE has
actually reinforced socioeconomic inequalities
rather than fostered social mobility.89 Poor quality and inequitable access are key constraints in
many countries.
Accountability and governance arrangements are often the weak link of skills-building
initiatives, with institutional failures often replacing market failures. On the positive side,
modern and flexible skills-development strategies have generally replaced old-fashioned and
mechanical manpower planning (box 5.8).
Many countries have also created oversight entities, such as the Pakistan Sindh Technical and
Vocational Training Authority, to separate quality control and management of providers from
financing. In India, the National Skills Development Strategy is based on the principle that the
institutions in charge of training, certification,
and accreditation should be strictly separated.90
On the negative side, scattered responsibilities
across many ministries, distance from the private sector, slow response to rapidly changing
skill needs, and capture by providers continue to

plague training programs and pre-employment
education around the world.
What is being taught matters as well. Social
skills are often the ones missing, but they can
rarely be acquired in schools or training centers.
In India, employers of engineers stress reliability, willingness to learn, and entrepreneurship
as more important than specific technical skills,
or the command of mathematics, science, or
English.91 In Botswana, theoretical and practical knowledge of the job, as well as other jobspecific skills, are generally considered to be
less important than skills such as commitment,
communication, and basic problem-solving.92
In Peru, 40 percent of employers complain about
the lack of dependable work ethics and personal
qualities such as team work, persistency, ability
to reach consensus, or initiative among their
employees. This subjective assessment is confirmed by harder evidence showing that returns
to the socioemotional trait of perseverance are
as high as returns to average cognitive ability.93

Learning through jobs
Just as skills are important for jobs, the reverse is
true as well. Many technical and social skills can
be built through experience in the workplace—
shaping skills on the job carries sizable returns.
On average across countries, the return to one
additional year of work experience in nonagricultural activities is roughly one-half the return
to one additional year of education at the beginning of work life.94 And managers put a premium on experience. In five African countries,
managers identified work experience as more
important for hiring decisions than technical
skills and education.95
Apprenticeship programs, fostering the integration of education and learning through
jobs, exist in various shapes around the world.
They range from the informal model of SubSaharan Africa to the dual model of Central
Europe. Informal apprenticeship, often the
primary mechanism for technical skills to be
passed through generations, can be strengthened through its gradual integration into national training systems.96
The dual model, deeply rooted in Germany,
combines classroom-based schooling—geared
to building general and transferable skills—with
learning on the job in the training company.97
In France, Germany, and the Netherlands, the

Manpower planning has given way to dynamic skills development

Manpower planning, a technique that used macroeconomic and
sector forecasts to derive how many workers with specific technical
skills would be needed was popular in the 1960s and 1970s. It was
successful in a few cases in which it was closely integrated with the
overall economic development strategy of the country and benefited from a universal basic education system, as it did in the Republic of Korea.a But its rigidity soon became stifling. Manpower planning generally assumed a fixed relationship between labor and
outputs, implicitly ruling out technological change. It also emphasized technical skills to the detriment of cognitive and social skills.
And it was slow to adapt to rapid changes in the world of work
brought by globalization.b
Gradually the focus shifted from merely ensuring an adequate
supply of skills to delivering demand-responsive, quality-skills
development programs. The Republic of Korea stopped developing
long-term macroeconomic plans with explicit industrial policies by
the mid-1990s. Industrial projections of manpower supply took a
backseat to the country’s new initiatives emphasizing quality and
relevance of education and skills development.c The scope became
broader and more integrated, replacing mechanistic forecasting. In
the 1980s and 1990s, Singapore developed an integrated strategy
to upgrade, retrain, and provide lifelong learning for its labor force,
especially for those with lower levels of education and skills.
The rapid pace of globalization increasingly requires the private
sector to be a driving force in skills development. India’s National

Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) developed standardized skills assessments and certification arrangements in 2006. The Korea University of Technology and Education
(KUT) established the Bridge Model, a three-way partnership also
involving a single major enterprise and clusters of small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) that serve as its main subcontractors. The major
enterprise contributes technical knowledge, the SMEs bring in the
employees to be trained, and KUT supplies the teaching facilities
and content.d Samsung was the first “bridge’” in 2006; five other
major companies have become bridges since then.
Much can be learned from comprehensive skill-building systems, especially from those of East Asia. But these systems require
sophisticated institutional mechanisms that may be out of reach in
lower-capacity contexts.e Over 100 countries have embarked on
comprehensive National Qualification Frameworks, built around
the definition of competencies, certification, and accreditation. But
with exceptions, results and impact are sobering.f Often, the
administrative capacity available in low- and middle-income countries is overwhelmed, and progress is held back by the lack of
strong buy-in from the most important players: parents, teachers,
training institutes, and firms. Perhaps the most valuable lesson
from East Asian countries is that skills-development systems need
to grow organically from below while being coordinated and fostered from above.

dual system is credited with fast and structured
employment integration.98 But the dual system
requires more than the right economic incentives—it is based on a social contract between
employers (to offer places and invest in the future career of apprentice as a common good),
trade unions (to accept below minimum wage
payment for trainees), and government (to fund
vocational schools and provide quality control).99 Private sector commitment, including
financing of training and continuation even in
times of economic downturns, is fundamental.
Given such high institutional requirements, attempts to transplant the dual model in its entirety have seen little success.
Building skills on the job is promising, because skills continue to develop and accumulate
after formal schooling ends, in teenage years and
during working life.100 Jobs—especially early

experiences—can also shape behaviors and attitudes, including the willingness to contribute
to society at large.
Importantly, jobs also support the transmission of knowledge through interactions with
other people. Knowledge spillovers underlie the
agglomeration effects observed in cities and in
production clusters.101 But knowledge spillovers
from jobs also occur in rural areas. During the
Green Revolution in India, farmers with experienced neighbors made larger profits than those
with inexperienced ones.102 Benefits from social
learning at the village level were substantial.103
Jobs can also ignite skills building by putting people in contact with the outside world.
Working in foreign-owned companies, or in
firms integrated in international value chains,
allows the acquisition of new technical and
managerial skills. This learning then spurs imi-

tation and can have cascading ripple effects.104
In Singapore, India’s Tata group was the first
international company to partner with the Economic Development Board in 1972 to establish
a company-owned training center for precision
engineers. This partnership model was successfully replicated in subsequent years with other
foreign companies, eventually leading to the
consolidation of various institutions in 1993 to
form Singapore’s Nanyang Polytechnic. Today,
the polytechnic has become a source of international expertise on industry-led training.105
Intel’s decision to establish its semiconductor
assembly and test plant in Costa Rica has equally
contributed significantly to that country’s prospects and skill building system.106

Jobs need skills, pull skills, and build skills
Some skills are necessary for productive employment to emerge in the first place. And they cannot
be acquired on the job. Without numeracy and
literacy skills, the prospects of improving employment opportunities and earnings, whether
in agriculture or in urban settings, are thin. Today, more than one-tenth of 15-to-24-year-olds
worldwide are functionally illiterate, and that
does not bode well for their future.107 Also, social
skills assume an ever more important role as
complements to basic cognitive skills. Given that
skill building is cumulative, securing the foundation on which much of the later path of skill acquisition follows remains an absolute priority.
Many countries are not there yet.
With this foundation in place, jobs can pull
skills. Employment opportunities increase the
demand for education, which systems then have

to meet. The role of policy here is to ensure that
signals are adequately transmitted, providing
incentives to continue skill accumulation by the
young and those of working age alike. In the
Dominican Republic, providing students with
information about the actual returns to secondary school education led to substantially higher
school attendance.108 In India, informing rural
women about job opportunities led to increased
schooling for girls and delayed marriage and
childbearing for women.109 On the other hand,
privilege in access to jobs distorts the signals. It
hurts and discourages, rather than encourages,
the building of skills.
Jobs themselves can build skills, especially at
entry into the labor market. Given the negative
long-term effects of troubled school-to-work
transitions, placing emphasis on supporting
first-time job-seekers should have significant
payoffs.
But jobs may neither pull nor build skills
to a significant degree, even if the foundational cognitive skills are in place. This occurs
in situations where the benefits from agglomeration and global integration are present but
not adequately exploited. Countries undergoing
rapid urbanization often have sizable knowledge
spillovers to reap but may fail to move up the
value-added ladder. If so, they can be caught in
traps of low productivity and low skills.110 Such
traps arise when skills are insufficient to spur innovation and the demand for skills is too low
to encourage their acquisition. In those cases,
more relevant schooling and skill building at the
secondary, technical, and likely higher levels are
needed as a prerequisite for the creation of good
jobs for development.

Diverse jobs agendas
Countries differ in where the development payoffs from jobs are greatest.
These payoffs depend on the country’s level of development, demography,
endowments, and institutions.

C

ountries face different jobs challenges as
they move along the development path.
In agrarian economies, most people are
still engaged in agriculture and urbanization has
not yet picked up. In urbanizing countries, productivity growth in agriculture has risen enough
to free up large numbers of people to work in cities. Formalizing countries generally have more developed economies, where the coverage of social
protection systems is large enough to envision
extending it to the entire workforce.
In some countries, the jobs challenge is
shaped by demography with special circumstances affecting particular groups. In countries with high youth unemployment, prolonged
joblessness and idleness affect large numbers
of young people, with many seeing limited opportunities for the future. Aging societies also
face generational issues, but these stem from a
decreasing share of the working age population
and increasing costs related to providing and
caring for a growing number of old people.
Natural endowments, including geography,
can create unique jobs challenges. Resourcerich countries may have substantial foreign exchange earnings, but this wealth often does not
translate into employment creation beyond
the exploitation of the natural resources. Small
island nations cannot reap the benefits from
agglomeration and global integration because
of the size of the population and geographic
remoteness.

Finally, the strength of institutions can define
a country’s jobs challenge. In conflict-affected
countries, institutions are fragile, private investment is largely out of reach for the time being,
and restoring social cohesion through jobs takes
on particular importance.
These criteria are not mutually exclusive. A
country may be both resource rich and conflict
affected, or it may belong to the formalizing
group and be characterized by high youth unemployment. Still, focusing on the key features
associated with each type of country situation
helps to clarify which jobs would make the
greatest contribution to development in a particular context. This allows for a richer analysis
of the potential tradeoffs among living standards, productivity, and social cohesion in a
specific country situation. And it provides clues
about the nature of the obstacles to job creation
and how they can be removed (question 6).

Agrarian economies
In countries where a majority of the population lives in rural areas, wage employment is not
the prevalent form of work. For instance, about
half of the employed population in Kenya is engaged in farming, whereas self-employment in
nonagricultural household businesses and wage
employment in informal enterprises account for
slightly more than one-third.1

	

Formal employment, including wage laborers in registered private enterprises and the
entire public sector, typically accounts for less
than 10 percent of total employment in agrarian
economies. The share of wage employment in
manufacturing is much smaller. A comparison
across several French-speaking Sub-Saharan
­African countries puts the fraction at less than 5
percent of total employment even in the capital
cities—less than 3 percent in Cotonou and Lomé
to 8 percent in Yaoundé; only Antananarivo has
more than 10 percent.2 Across Sub-Saharan Africa, one-quarter or less of formal sector workers are women; only in Senegal does the fraction
exceed one-third.3 If anything, employment in
the formal sector has trended downward over
the past two decades as state-owned enterprises
have been privatized and foreign trade has been
liberalized.
In this context, the notion of unemployment
needs to be interpreted with caution. Unemployment rates can technically be computed,
but given the prevalence of poverty in agrarian
economies, a substantive share of the labor force
is unlikely to remain idle for long. Underemployment and low earnings, rather than open
unemployment, are the challenges most people
face in agrarian economies. Household survey
data from Mozambique show that an astounding 81 percent of those at work were living on
less than US$1.25 a day in 2003, and 95 percent
were living on less than US$2.00 a day.4
In agrarian economies, the main avenues to
improving living standards involve increasing
productivity in farming, creating a dynamic
economic environment in cities, and promoting labor reallocation from rural to urban areas,
thereby sparking a positive spiral of productivity growth and improvement in living standards. Together, these approaches should lead to
the expansion of off-farm employment opportunities, which are in turn an important driver
of poverty reduction.
Mozambique illustrates the jobs challenges
faced by agrarian economies.5 Thanks to important mining discoveries and a commodities
boom, as well as Maputo’s privileged position as
one of the ports closest to Johannesburg, Mozambique has had one of the best growth performances in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past
decade. Yet, after falling substantially during the
1990s, probably as a consequence of the end of

Diverse jobs agendas   

the civil war, the poverty rate remained basically
unchanged between 2003 and 2008, at around
55 percent of the total population.6
Agriculture is the locus of much of Mozambique’s poverty. Over 80 percent of employment
is in agriculture, yet the sector accounts for only
30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).7
Value added per hour worked in agriculture is
one-seventh that of services and one-twelfth
that of manufacturing. Yields have been stagnant over the past decade. About 95 percent of
agricultural workers work on small plots, the
use of modern technology is low, and access to
extension services is minimal.
Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture
delivers more poverty reduction than other sectors in lower-income countries, because poor
people are concentrated in the sector and because they participate more in the growth in
agriculture than in the growth in other sectors.8
Since 1700, virtually every example of mass
poverty reduction has actually begun with an
increase in agricultural productivity.9
Constraints on agricultural growth vary
depending on the availability of land relative
to the availability of farm labor. Compared
with other areas of the developing world, SubSaharan Africa was traditionally seen as a continent of ample land and scarce labor. While that
may still be true in some areas, it no longer applies to countries in the south and east of the
continent. In Mozambique, the average farm
size is less than 1.5 hectares. As the area under
cultivation declines relative to the size of the
population, producing sufficient food becomes
a major issue unless yield-enhancing technological changes take place. In many agrarian economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, these changes have
yet to occur. Unlike many parts of Asia, where
the Green Revolution has increased cereal yield
and the poverty incidence has declined, cereal
yield has remained low and poverty incidence
high in these Sub-Saharan countries (figure
6.1). Some Asian economies, such as Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and
Myanmar, face similar challenges.
Public sector investments are important drivers of productivity growth and intensification
of smallholder agriculture. Technology is often
a public good. Because farmers can reproduce
improved varieties of rice and wheat, private
seed companies cannot reap the benefit of in-

troducing new varieties and so tend not to make
the effort. Hybrid seeds of maize, sorghum, and
millet cannot be reproduced by farmers, and,
hence, the private sector supplies seeds. But even
in these cases, basic research is carried out by
the public sector. As a result, public support is
necessary to develop biological and chemical
technologies.
These are enduring collaborations between
advanced agricultural research centers and national programs in Sub-Saharan Africa. They
have developed improved varieties of cotton
and cassava in ways that are reminiscent of
the long-term collaboration in rice and wheat
research between international agricultural research centers and national programs in Asia.10
The recent surge in the production of high-value
crops for export, including in Mozambique, is
also encouraging.11 Aside from these examples,
however, few improved crops appropriate to the
African climate have been developed.
Gravity irrigation systems are a local public good as well. Irrigated land accounts for
only 5 percent of the total cultivated area in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Lowland rice yields in irrigated areas in Sub-Saharan Africa in general

and Mozambique in particular are comparable with yields in Asia.12 In such areas, improved varieties developed in Asia or crossbred
with local varieties have been adopted. This
observation suggests that, as far as lowland rice
is concerned, Asian technology could be directly transferred to the irrigated areas of SubSaharan Africa.
While the intensification of crop-based agriculture has been associated with a significant
increase in the use of inorganic fertilizer, the
application of fertilizer per hectare is far lower
in Sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region of the world. One of the major reasons is
the high fertilizer prices relative to grain prices.
Fertilizer prices are usually two to three times
higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia and
Latin America because of poor infrastructure
and trade logistics.13 Another major constraint
on fertilizer application is the lack of credit for
smallholders, given that land ownership titles
are seldom secured and hence cannot be used
as collateral.14 Therefore, productivity growth in
agriculture also requires a favorable investment
climate including improved access to infrastructure and credit.15

	

Diverse jobs agendas   

The job structure in the cities is dominated
by self-employment, with petty commerce
growing quickly. If agriculture matters most for
poverty reduction, successful urbanization may
hold the key to more rapid productivity and income growth as well as social cohesion. In most
of Sub-Saharan Africa, however, urbanization
has failed to create the dynamism observed elsewhere in the developing world. Migration from
rural to urban areas continues, but migrants are
simply swelling the ranks of the self-employed
earning subsistence wages. In the absence of dynamic cities, migration is driven by despair, and
not hope. In Mozambique, for example, young
people are moving to urban areas, but few are
moving into regular wage employment. Meanwhile, levels of trust are falling and are lowest
among young workers.16
Some have argued that the jobs challenge
in these urban areas can be addressed through
the creation of greater opportunities for selfemployment. For example, building space for
informal markets around bus stops would allow
more rural migrants to make a living. But selfemployment of this sort is unlikely to support
the agglomeration effects and knowledge spillovers that make cities thrive elsewhere.
An alternative approach is to create conditions for labor-intensive light manufacturing

to take off. This approach focuses on identifying activities that may hold latent comparative
advantage and on removing the constraints
that dissuade private firms from taking up these
activities. In fact, there are many informal industrial clusters in urban areas in Sub-Saharan
­Africa. They produce garments, leather shoes,
simple metal products, and furniture, among
other things, though seldom for export.17 These
clusters have spontaneously developed, suggesting a potential comparative advantage in these
industries. Reducing logistics costs, removing
red tape, and addressing coordination issues
could create the necessary conditions to attract
foreign investors to these clusters, especially at a
time when wage increases in coastal China are
encouraging the relocation of some industries
where low labor costs are a key competitive factor (box 6.1).18
Jobs, which start to trigger agglomeration
effects and make connections to the global
economy, are good jobs for development in
agrarian countries. To create more of these jobs
and become centers of economic dynamism,
cities need to be more functional. But even in
the most optimistic scenario, it will take time to
complete the urbanization process, so increasing productivity in agriculture is a priority for
reducing the high poverty levels.

Conflict-affected countries
Jobs are among the most pressing issues in countries in conflict or emerging from it.19 They are
critical for restoring the livelihoods of individuals and families affected by war and violence,
reintegrating ex-combatants, and rebuilding everybody’s sense of belonging in society. They are
also key to jump-start economic activity, reconnect people, and reconstruct networks and the
social fabric. Alongside security and justice, jobs

are central to breaking cycles of violence, restoring confidence in institutions, and giving people
a stake in society.20
Yet the obstacles to creating jobs in conflictaffected countries are staggering and confront
policy makers with overwhelming questions.
How can jobs be generated quickly for demobilized soldiers, displaced persons, and vulnerable groups affected by violence or war? What
kinds of government programs can have a quick
impact? How can the private sector become an

Can agrarian Ethiopia compete in manufacturing?

The labor productivity of workers in well-managed firms in Ethiopia is comparable with that in China and Vietnam, although wages are only a quarter of
those in China and half those in Vietnam. Ethiopia thus has the potential to
compete globally in apparel thanks to a significant and growing labor cost
advantage. It is also close to a state-of-the-art and well-located container port
in Djibouti and has duty-free access to the markets of the European Union and
the United States. The binding constraint on Ethiopia’s competitiveness in
apparel is poor trade logistics, which wipe out its labor cost advantage and cut
the country off from the higher-value time-sensitive segments of the market.
Establishing a fast-track channel for moving apparel through customs, providing free and immediate access to foreign exchange, reducing the cost of letters
of credit, and setting up an industrial zone closer to Djibouti would alleviate the
most important trade logistics bottlenecks. These steps would also put Ethiopia in a position to attract investors to lead the industry in the same way that
China and Vietnam have done.
Ethiopia also benefits from an abundance of natural resources. Raw materials such as skins for the footwear industry and hard and soft timber for the furniture industry are available. But they are expensive. A cubic meter of timber
costs US$667, compared to US$344 in China and US$246 at most in Vietnam. So
urban consumers in Ethiopia buy imported modern furniture, which is cheaper
and of better quality. Yet Ethiopia has enormous unexploited potential in timber, particularly bamboo. Reforms could make the country’s furniture industry
competitive in the domestic market, create more productive jobs, and save
­foreign exchange.

 onflict can increase labor force participation
C
among women

Out of necessity, women often intensify their economic activity during periods
of conflict. Post-conflict programs that target women can help them take
advantage of the window of opportunity presented by conflict and assume
new roles that contribute meaningfully to local economic recovery. Women in
North Maluku, Indonesia, were active participants in the rapid recovery and
poverty reduction that occurred in the wake of nearly a year of intensely violent
civil strife. “Since 2002, when the conflict ended, I have run a retail shop for
extra income to fulfill our family needs. . . . I received support money that I used
for my business capital from the Ternate city government. . . . Ten years ago, I
was only a housewife because I didn’t have the capital to run the business as I
do now,” a 38-year-old married woman reported.

engine for employment creation? Moreover,
countries affected by conflict are often poor to
begin with. Their opportunities, resources, and
capacity are scarce; data for planning may simply not exist.
Conflict environments range from situations with high levels of criminal violence to

civil wars and other forms of internal conflict.
Less frequently, they involve hostilities between
states. When entire countries are affected by internal or external conflict, the jobs challenge is
particularly daunting because of institutional
breakdown and fractured connectivity with the
outside world. If conflict is localized, constraints
are less severe where functioning infrastructure,
services, and institutions can be extended to
conflict-affected regions once hostilities become
manageable. Conflict situations are generally
further complicated by large numbers of displaced people. At the end of 2010, an estimated
15.4 million people sought refuge from conflict
outside their home countries, and another 27.5
million were displaced internally.21
Conflict can fundamentally disrupt jobs by
destroying or damaging infrastructure and access to markets, as well as through altering incentives. In Sri Lanka, conflict in the north disrupted economic activity and created favorable
conditions for the insurgency to recruit among
the newly unemployed.22
Even during war, however, people work. Jobs
disproportionately involve low-pay or unpaid
work, such as subsistence agriculture or petty
trading. Youth in rural areas in post-conflict
Liberia reported working two to four jobs at a
time.23 Across countries, conflict increases fe­male labor force participation, as women work to
help their households cope with income shocks
and to compensate for the absence of men who
are fighting (box 6.2).24 In Afghanistan, female
employment rates were higher in high-conflict
than in low-conflict areas; in Nepal, they increased more than in high-conflict areas.25
Some jobs in conflict-affected countries may
involve illegal activities that persist in the aftermath of conflict because of weak governance
and lack of legal alternatives. Even if these activities are limited in scope, they may undermine the creation of good jobs for development
by distorting incentives and generating rents.
In Afghanistan, poppy cultivation is an important source of income for rural households.26 In
Somalia, piracy creates jobs for some through
the employment of speed boat crews and related land-based operations.27 In Liberia, young
people in rural areas have supplemented their
income by working in illegal mining, rubber
tapping, and logging.28
Jobs are central to recovery in countries
emerging from conflict, but the barriers to job

	

creation can be especially steep (box 6.3). Firms
in conflict-affected countries report that political instability is the most severe bottleneck
to business followed by the lack of electricity
(figure 6.2). Simply getting basic services up
and running can be a major issue. Corruption
and the lack of finance are also among the top
constraints. Security risks because of high crime
rates or armed conflict reduce returns to investment and can persist even after the armed
conflict has officially ended. Firms may need additional funds to hire private security or to pay
bribes. The loss of skills because of migration
and disruptions in schooling can also create obstacles for firms.
Demobilization and reintegration of former
combatants are major challenges for countries
emerging from conflict. Although ex-combatants
make up a relatively small share of the total
population, unemployment and idleness, particularly of young men, are stress factors that
can strain and potentially undermine fragile
post-conflict environments.29 Jobs can compensate for the loss of identity and status associated
with the dissolution of armed forces and militias
and the income lost from theft and looting. Jobs
can also help deter further involvement in gangs
and violence. Yet not all jobs are alternatives to
violence, especially if they provide little income
and the work is drudgery.
Most disarmament, demobilization, and
reintegration programs include some form of
employment support such as emergency temporary jobs, cash for work, public employment
services, small grants, or vocational training.
Temporary employment programs can play
an important bridging role by providing jobs
quickly to ex-combatants and other vulnerable
populations in the absence of other options. Evidence on whether temporary programs reduce
conflict and contribute to rebuilding communities is less clear. Cash-for-work programs can be
costly and may strain stretched public budgets,
may create poor quality and unsustainable assets, and can be divisive and lead to tensions if
they are targeted only at certain groups.
Broadly targeted community-based programs may be more conducive to stability. In
the Democratic Republic of Congo, where many
ex-combatants have had a difficult time finding
jobs, associations of ex-combatants and community members share information about employment opportunities and social support and

Solving jobs challenges is urgent in South Sudan

The Republic of South Sudan, the world’s newest country, exemplifies the
challenges countries face emerging from conflict. South Sudan has natural
resources, including oil, yet more than four-fifths of the population lives in rural
areas, and most depend on subsistence farming and cattle raising. Half of the
population lives in poverty, which is especially deep in rural areas, according to
the 2009 household survey. Only slightly more than one-fourth of the adult
population is literate, and prospects for future human capital development are
dim: almost half of 10- to 14-year-olds are working, with only slightly more than
one-third in school.a
The International Organization for Migration estimates that 4 million people were displaced during the Sudanese civil war, and that nearly 1.9 million
have returned since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in
2005.b The return of internally displaced persons creates substantial pressures
on already poor communities. The new government of South Sudan is aiming
to demobilize 150,000 soldiers over the next six to eight years.c Access to land
rights and conflict among nomadic groups are also notable challenges for jobs,
as is the legacy of overemployment in the public sector, which is not sustainable given severe fiscal pressures.
Creating jobs is one of the most immediate concerns facing the new government—jobs that can contribute to peace and stability, provide sustainable
living standards through legal and nonviolent activity, and foster economic
recovery. Generating these jobs involves building an enabling environment for
private sector investment. That will take time, however, and alternatives are
urgently needed for groups whose lack of jobs can threaten stability, including
internally displaced persons, ex-combatants, and youth.

also help manage disputes.30 Programs can be
tailored to facilitate the reintegration of youth,
particularly young men, who have been involved
in conflict. In some cases, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Sierra
­Leone, young ex-combatants have no memory
of peaceful times or normal civilian life.
Ultimately, conflict-affected countries need
to attract private investment. The state can play
an enabling role by strengthening regulations
and institutions, rebuilding basic infrastructure, and providing security.31 Partnerships
between the public and private sectors, donors,
and civil society can help to rebuild markets
and investor confidence. Connecting farmers
and entrepreneurs through value chains has
the potential to spark innovation and employment growth.32 Business associations can support entrepreneurship and help solve collective
action problems by restoring law and order,
roads, and electricity.33 As security is restored,

however, the jobs focus can shift from targeted

Tackling the jobs challenge faced by conflict-affected countries is a formidable task: it
requires creating jobs that contribute to peace
and stability, that are an alternative to illegal

economic activity and violence, and that start
the long process of economic recovery. In
conflict settings, jobs can also have development payoffs for social cohesion by involving
people in productive activities that strengthen
self-esteem and give them a sense of identity
and status, by rebuilding networks, and by giving people a sense that opportunities are fairly
distributed.

Urbanizing countries
Urbanizing countries endowed with abundant
unskilled labor have the potential to enter a virtuous jobs circle. The integration of these countries into the world economy can lead to the creation of extensive employment opportunities,
especially in light manufacturing. These jobs
may involve hard work, relatively low pay, and
limited or negligible benefits, but in general they
are preferable to jobs in agriculture. They can
also be the entry point to a process of economic
and technological upgrading that leads to better
jobs in the future.34 Employment opportunities for the unskilled thus provide avenues out
of poverty for large numbers of households. In
countries in which women’s jobs choices have
been restricted, new employment opportunities in urbanizing economies can bring about
important changes at the household and society
levels.
This has been the story of several East Asian
countries over the past half century. In many respects, it has also been the recent story of Ban­
gladesh, where industrialization is growing in
large cities such as Chittagong and Dhaka. The
industrial sector now accounts for nearly 30
percent of value added, up from 20 percent in
1990, and the urbanization rate is approaching
30 percent, double what is was in 1980.35 Exports
as a percentage of GDP tripled between 1990
and 2010, with much of the increase in a thriving ready-made garment industry that is highly
intensive in female labor. This structural transformation, along with improvements in agricultural productivity, has had a major impact on
living standards. GDP per capita has doubled in
the past two decades and the share of the population living below US$1.25 a day fell from 70 percent in 1992 to 43 percent in 2010.36 Productivity
and earnings growth still lag behind some of its
neighbors, but Bangladesh’s story is remarkable
because the country was often held out in the development literature as a hopeless case (box 6.4).
These successes have been built on modernization in the agricultural sector, an industrial
sector able to absorb low-skilled surplus farm
labor, and supportive social policies.
Faster technology adoption has led to productivity increases in agriculture. Farmers have
shifted from growing low-yield, single-crop,
deep-water rice to double cropping of short-

maturity, high-yield rice. There has also been
a pronounced shift away from sharecropping
into fixed-rent leasehold tenancy. Landless and
marginal farmers have been the major beneficiaries of this change. Simultaneously, credit
constraints have been relaxed thanks to the
country’s well-known microfinance institutions.
Access to finance has facilitated human capital
accumulation, especially in women’s education and health, and promoted investments in
microenterprises.
Despite the still considerable labor surplus
in rural areas, real wages in agriculture have
increased from the monetary equivalent of less
than 2.5 kilograms of rice a day in 1983 to more
than 6.0 kilograms today. The seasonal hunger
associated with the monga period—between
transplanting and harvesting paddy—is receding. Remittances from women working in factories and from men working in construction
have also helped reduce rural poverty.
The movement of labor out of agriculture has
been facilitated by close urban proximity, resulting from Bangladesh’s high population density.
Special links allowed by proximity also may have
supported productivity growth among laborers
engaged in rural nonfarm sectors. The ready-

Development pessimism about Bangladesh was
understandable, but has been proven wrong
BOX 6.4 

In 1975, the first book on the economy of Bangladesh commented: “If the problem of Bangladesh can be solved, there can be reasonable confidence that less
difficult problems of development can also be solved. It is in this sense that
Bangladesh is to be regarded as the test case of development.”a In the same
spirit, a well-known study on famines concluded that Bangladesh was “below
poverty equilibrium.”b
Such a negative perception of the viability of the Bangladesh economy
was conditioned by the adverse initial conditions facing the country after
independence—high population density, a limited natural-resource base,
­
underdeveloped infrastructure, frequent natural disasters, and political
uncertainty.
This negative perception has given way to optimism in global development
circles because of Bangladesh’s positive record of socioeconomic development
in recent decades. Some countries have done well in human development indicators, and others have done well in economic growth, but Bangladesh belongs
to a rather small group of countries that have done well on both fronts, the initial pessimism notwithstanding. This is the crux of the surprise.

made garment industry has been an important
part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh.
About 3 million women are working in this
sector, which has a strong export orientation.
Construction has been an important employer
for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many
low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially
to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing
by about 10 percent every year.37
Light manufacturing opens up opportunities
for large numbers of workers in urbanizing economies because skill requirements are modest.
Firms demand some education but it is generally
limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent
of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some
education but only 28 percent had secondary
schooling or more.38 These education levels are
considerably higher, though, than the educational attainment of workers in agriculture, so
opportunities in the garment industry stimulate
schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has
other beneficial effects on women, as well. Growing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost
of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the
age of marriage and reduce the birth rate. To
the extent that women’s educational attainment
and labor market participation rise, the status of
women in society is enhanced.

BOX 6.5  The

entrepreneurs of Bangladesh are local

The ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh has grown rapidly over the
past three decades, and the country now ranks among the largest garment
exporters in the world. While the early successes have been attributed to an
initial technology transfer from the Republic of Korea, such a one-time infusion
of knowledge alone is insufficient to explain the sustained growth. In this
respect, the pattern of development in Bangladesh is similar to that in East Asia,
where investment in human capital and the importation and assimilation of
technological and managerial knowledge from advanced countries played a
critical role in promoting industrialization.
Primary data collected from knitwear manufacturers and garment traders
can be used to explore the process of the continuous learning of advanced
skills and expertise. The data show that the initial infusion of specific human
capital attracted highly educated entrepreneurs to the industry, that the division of labor between manufacturers and traders facilitated the expansion of
the industry, and that enterprise growth has endured because of the continuous learning from abroad by the highly educated entrepreneurs. These factors,
taken together, account for the high profitability of garment manufacturing in
Bangladesh.

On the social policy front, both governmental and nongovernmental organizations have established pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-women
programs. These have been instrumental in
reducing population growth and encouraging
more effective public and private investments in
education and health.
Agricultural modernization, labor migration, and social policies have altered the jobs
landscape of Bangladesh, but these trans­
formations have not involved a substantial
formalization of the economy. The share of
jobs benefitting from legal protection or social insurance has not increased much over the
past decade. The booming construction sector
remains largely informal. Corporate social responsibility among export-oriented corporations in Bangladesh is making some difference
in the ready-made garment sector, but worker
unrest has been recurrent. But corporate social
responsibility is mainly associated with exports
to industrial countries and may become less
relevant if the sector diversifies its exports to
other developing countries. Corporate social
responsibility is unlikely to be a workable option in construction. But while formalization
has not advanced, the development of entrepreneurship has been remarkable, leading to
the creation of thousands of nationally owned
medium and large firms within a mere two decades (box 6.5).
Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case
that is important to understand, especially given
its starting point. The government has provided
some support, with export processing zones,
bonded warehouses, and special treatment of
garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects,
such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosperous eastern and lagging western regions, have
made it easier to move around the country. But
government has not played the leading role in
the transformation. Corruption is a problem
and the cost of doing business is high. Power failures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and
those that are paved are highly congested. Despite these obstacles, agricultural modernization
has occurred thanks to the Green Revolution
associated with the development and diffusion
of high-yielding varieties of rice and access to
finance. Labor has moved out of agriculture
through industrialization, and social policies

have been supportive through family planning
and social protection.
Urbanizing countries like Bangladesh have
the potential to exploit several spillovers. But a
key challenge for them is to find a way to move
up the value-added chain and diversify manufacturing exports. Apart from ready-made garments, few sectors have grown substantially in

Bangladesh.39 The pharmaceutical industry
has developed, and the different pattern of development there relative to that of the garment
industry is intriguing. But the high skill levels
required by the pharmaceutical sector and other
higher value-added export sectors are unlikely
to make them a source of jobs for the masses of
youth with only primary education.

Urbanizing
countries

Resource-rich countries
Investments in extractive industries can represent a sizable fraction of a developing country’s
GDP and lead to spectacular increases in export
revenue, but they do not create many jobs. The
number of people at work during the construction phase may be sufficient to generate dynamism at the local level, but once the mines and
fields are in operation, employment goes down
dramatically. Perhaps the most extreme example
is the liquid natural gas project in Papua New
Guinea. The investment cost of the project exceeded twice the country’s GDP at project startup, and the project may lead to double-digit
growth rates for many years. But it is unlikely
to generate more than 1,000 direct jobs in the
longer term (table 6.1).
Links to the rest of the economy tend to be
weak as well. Port facilities, transport corridors,
and logistical, financial, and accounting services
are needed. In some cases, oil refining and ore
processing can also be carried out within the
country. All these services are bound to generate
high-value-added jobs in major cities and hubs.
But even after including all backward and forward links, the ratio between the total number
of jobs generated and the number of direct jobs
is likely to remain in the single digits. Taking into
account direct and indirect job effects, extractive
industries may not account for more than 1 or

2 percent of total employment in resource-rich
developing countries.
In addition, extractive industries can have
important negative impacts on jobs elsewhere in
the economy. These effects are often considered
manifestations of Dutch disease, a reference to
the experience of the Netherlands after large
natural gas fields were discovered in the province of Groningen in the late 1950s. The ensuing
export revenue led to strong real exchange rate
appreciation, deterioration in competitiveness
in sectors exposed to international competition,
and a loss of jobs in these tradable sectors.
Some industrial countries confronted with
resource booms have successfully protected
or fostered the diversification of their economies. Norway offers what may be the most
striking example. With strong backing from
the labor movement, centralized collectivebargaining agreements ensure that real wages do
not grow more rapidly than the productivity of
the tradable sectors, excluding oil. Wage moderation supports employment opportunities for
everybody, to the point that the unemployment
rate remained close to 3 percent during the recent global financial crisis. Oil revenue is used
for long-term investments but is not immediately converted into higher labor earnings.
Among oil-rich countries elsewhere, the
United Arab Emirates has also managed to diversify its economy through financial and logis-

tics services. But overall, in the Gulf states, national citizens have become direct beneficiaries
of the oil bonanza through well-paid jobs in the
public sector. In the larger countries, these jobs
are rationed, with some groups, such as women
and youth, having less access than those with
good connections. Menial jobs are performed
by immigrants on temporary contracts who receive modest pay and benefits. Jobs are a window to rent sharing for some but do not give a
stake in society to others.
This tension between jobs for productivity and jobs for social cohesion may be even
more difficult to avoid in developing countries,
because they lack the institutional strength of
Norway or the implementation capacity of the
United Arab Emirates. In resource-rich developing countries, the concern is not only about losing competitiveness in tradable sectors but also
about missing out on the benefits of urbanization. Indeed, the price of land in major agglomerations becomes prohibitively high in resourcerich developing countries. By one measure, the
most expensive city in the world is Luanda (table 6.2). According to this measure, 3 of the top
5, and 9 of the top 50 most expensive cities in the
world are in resource-rich developing countries.
Because they do not have the economic density of London, New York, or Tokyo, cities in

resource-rich developing countries find it difficult to reap the benefits of agglomeration. Specialization in the production of commodities
(including agricultural products such as ­cocoa)
may be an important reason why urbanization has failed to deliver growth in countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa.40 These wealthy consumption agglomerations are nonetheless attracting
rural migrants, thereby fueling local inequality, discontent, and crime. None of the cities in
resource-rich developing countries among the
top 50 in the world according to cost of living
is among the top 50 according to quality of life.
While extractive industries fail to create
many jobs, they do contribute to the local economy through other channels. A recent survey
of employees of large-scale mining projects in
Papua New Guinea shows that they make remittances both in kind and in cash to their
households. Most remittances in kind were for
construction and building materials (41 percent), followed by transport-related items (28
percent).41 Cash contributions were used most
often for school fees (29 percent) and transportation-related items (12 percent). Employees
also reported accommodating relatives visiting
from rural areas. Some of their guests helped
with housework, and some obtained education
at the host’s expense.42

Artisanal mining can flourish in parallel with
major investments and raise the living standards
of local communities. In Papua New Guinea, the
number of grassroots alluvial miners is two to
three times greater than the number of people
working in the formal extractive industries sector, even if contractors and temporary workers
are counted among the latter. Some of the large
extractive projects, such as Ok Tedi Mine, happen to be in poor areas. Thus, the artisanal mining taking place around them helps spread the
wealth.
But poverty maps show a significant level of
spatial dispersion in living standards and a persistence of poverty over the past three decades.43
The deepest and most persistent rural poverty
in Papua New Guinea occurs in areas with no
known mineral resources.
When large extractive projects close, artisanal and small-scale mining can also contribute to the local economy by cushioning the
decline in earnings. For example, in Misima in
Papua New Guinea, local people had become
used to making a living around the only large
mine project, Misima Mines Limited. When the
project closed in 2004, the economy of Misima
ground to a halt, and local residents found it
hard to make ends meet. Artisanal and smallscale mining provided an avenue for income

for some: each hard rock miner could earn
the equivalent of US$50,000–$75,000 a year,
and each alluvial miner could make around
US$10,000 a year. This income became the
main contribution to the local economy, together with remittances sent by those ex-Misima Mines Limited employees who found work
in large mines elsewhere.44
And even in mining areas, social impacts are
more mixed than the positive effect on living
standards suggests. The influx of money from
mining enclaves has enabled men to pay high
prices for brides and marry multiple wives on
an unprecedented scale, which might have
contributed to a decline in women’s status.
Around Porgera Mine, the abandonment of
older wives and the increasing number of
women taken from other tribal groups are considered factors in the increased incidence of
domestic violence and tension with neighboring groups. In Lihir, when groups of landowners received compensation and royalty payments, no women were given authority to
control the accounts.45 In addition, children
normally help out in artisanal and small-scale
mines. In Misima, because of clear restrictions
and training by the Wau Small-Scale Mining
Center, children are less involved in mining
than before, but child labor remains a con-

cern.46 Finally, land disputes often take place
among artisanal miners as people tend to trespass on other’s land to find minerals.47
Beyond local communities, the boom in extractive industries is affecting jobs in the main
agricultural sector of Papua New Guinea. Palm
oil exports have been growing steadily in recent
years and now exceed the exports of all other agricultural crops combined. Remarkably, the production of palm oil fruit involves 18,000 smallholder blocks around the main plantations.48
While this sector makes a significant contribution to the economy, improving rural livelihoods
and generating employment, the extractive industries boom is undermining the competitiveness of palm oil exports through higher wages
for skilled employees and higher logistics costs.
The higher wages paid to skilled workers are
also eroding the effectiveness of the public sector. Entire departments in government and in
education and training institutions have been
depleted because their staff leaves for more attractive opportunities in the extractive industries
sector. Mining companies complain about the
shortage of skills at the same time as they poach
people away from the education and training
system, where they could help build skills. For
instance, among 181 interviewees in a recent
survey on large-scale mining projects, 58 workers (or 32 percent) had at least a university degree.49 Raising salaries in the public sector may
be needed, but that would create other problems.
Absenteeism is rife and service delivery is poor.
Without strengthened accountability, higher salaries would only transform many public sector
jobs into a window for rent sharing.
An encouraging development has been the
success of some landowner companies around
mining enclaves. These companies may have
built up a good work ethic and developed effective business practices in places that were far
removed from the modern economy only a few
years ago. Not all landowner companies have
been successful, however, and this model may
fail to spread the wealth from extractive industries beyond the surrounding areas (box 6.6).

The challenge of resource-rich economies is
often framed in terms of transparency, which is
certainly important for social cohesion. However, accounting for the money involved in extractive industries is only part of the solution.
Equally important is ensuring that resources
flow from booming enclaves and hubs to the
poorer parts of the country, especially in the
form of basic infrastructure and service delivery. Focusing the flow of resources on the demand side rather than on the supply side (for
example, on health insurance rather than public hospitals) may contribute to productivity
rather than to the creation of new windows for
rent sharing.
Beyond public finance, the concentration
of wealth in mining enclaves and urban hubs
requires attention to spatial pricing issues. The
benefits of agglomeration cannot be reaped if
urban land becomes prohibitively expensive.
Active efforts are needed to increase the availability of urban land and keep urban housing
affordable. Despite such efforts, the cost of labor is bound to be much higher in mining enclaves and urban hubs. Labor policies need to
take these disparities into account and avoid
making workers too expensive in poorer and
more remote areas through minimum wages
or mandated benefits that mimic the wages and
benefits available in the booming parts of the
country.
The main challenge facing resource-rich
countries is to spread the wealth in ways that do
not undermine productivity growth and social
cohesion spillovers. Good jobs for development
in this context are those that generate output (as
opposed to just absorbing it) outside the extractive industries sector. Incentives for firms to create jobs and for people to work are important
if the economy is going to diversify its export
base. The abundance of foreign currency can
be a constraint because of exchange rate appreciation. The experience of some countries, most
notably Norway, shows how sovereign funds
that are used for long-run investments can manage this foreign currency problem.

Landowner companies can build capacity while spreading the wealth

Firms linked to local landowner groups in Papua New Guinea are
developing increasingly diversified businesses and are able to
compete regionally, even nationally, thereby generating jobs with
a range of skill levels. The origin of these firms is the communal
ownership of land in Papua New Guinea, which has meant that
mining companies have had to pay compensation for land to communities rather than to individuals. As a result, some of the landowner companies have up to 300,000 shareholders. National
agencies negotiate with individual resources projects for local
landowning groups to have privileged rights to supply selected
services to the project.
The most successful landowner companies, including Trans
Wonderland, Anitua, the iPi Group, National Catering, and Star
Mountain, are locally managed. Their business activities extend
beyond the core job streams of the extractive industries sector in
exploration, construction, and extraction. For example, they provide logistical services through a franchise truck-ownership structure and catering services that reach out to all Papua New Guinea
including to customers outside the natural resource sectors.

The key to the successes of these companies may be the clear
separation between their social roles and their business model,
which builds on solid corporate governance. The landowner origins
and commercial focus allow them to partner with landowner groups
in other resource project areas, which helps them to build scale and
management depth. Expatriates with a genuine interest in development seem to have played an important part in achieving the
proper balance.
Not all landowner companies have been equally successful. Most
exist purely to distribute rents from mines to communities and have
no ambitions of building sustainable economic opportunities for
their members. Two of four companies established in Central Province never gained a foothold because the funds that were supposed
to serve as equity vanished. Even the successful landowner companies may be unsustainable beyond the construction phase of extractive industries, during which the demand for support services is
exceptionally high. Skeptics wonder whether building work skills
through the development of these businesses is really more valuable than investing in service delivery through local infrastructure.

countries are price-takers in world markets,
these cost premiums are hard to pass on to
customers. The only way these economies can
export is by accepting lower profits and labor
earnings. But in industries such as electronic assembly and clothing, even if capital earns negative returns and wages are zero, the unit cost of
production in a tiny economy would still exceed
prevailing world prices. 50
A number of small island nations, especially
those located in the Pacific Ocean, are also confronted with the challenge of remoteness. When
small islands are located far away from economic

203

centers, the cost of trading with them may become prohibitive. In the case of Pacific island
nations, the average GDP-weighted distance
to trading partners is about 11,000 kilometers,
compared with about 8,000 kilometers for small
countries in the Caribbean (figure 6.3).51 Not
surprisingly, these Pacific island nations also
trade less relative to other small countries.
Smallness and fragmentation further raise
the costs of public services and infrastructure. A
road, an energy network, or a government ministry that serves 100,000 people is likely to have
a higher cost per user than one serving 10 million people. High fixed costs have to be spread
across a smaller number of people, and often
across a larger number of locations, which implies higher costs of doing business.
These geographic challenges are fundamental to the economic experience of these small island nations. Unfortunately, policies cannot alter these disadvantages, but they can be partially
offset through integration with bigger economies. Canada’s seasonal agricultural worker
program with Caribbean and Latin American
countries is an example. Several other similar
bilateral agreements have been introduced.52
In fact, tighter political relationships with large
economic centers are found to be associated

with higher income levels among small island
nations.53
Migration is one of the key channels for economic integration. As workers move to larger
economic centers, they gain access to larger
markets, cheaper inputs, and more investment.
Thus, the labor force is put to more productive
use and can earn higher incomes. In turn, remittances from migrants improve living standards at home. Moving labor to larger markets
also allows workers and entrepreneurs to interact with more dynamic firms, thus acquiring
better and more diversified skills and gaining
exposure to new ideas.
Emigrants account for over 20 percent of the
total population in a majority of these countries.
On average, remittances are responsible for over
8 percent of GDP in Pacific island countries
and for 5 percent in other small island nations
(figure 6.4). In fact, migration is behind several
success stories. Samoa has a long history of migration into New Zealand, through a treaty of
friendship in existence for more than 30 years,
and the Cook Islands are in a free association
with New Zealand. Both have been able to register sustained growth in contrast to the experiences of other Pacific island nations.54
It may take time for the benefits from migration to materialize, as a comparison of Tonga
and Fiji illustrates. Tonga has more than 40 years
of substantial migration and receives large per
capita remittance flows. In Fiji, international
migration is a much more recent phenomenon.
Household surveys show that more than 90
percent of households receive remittances in
Tonga, compared with 43 percent of households
in Fiji.55
The different historical paths influence the
impact of migration on the domestic economy.
In countries with a more mature migration,
household behavior at home is more tilted toward business activities. In both Tonga and
Fiji, migration and remittances lead to higher
savings, but they have a different impact on
household income generation. In Tonga, both
the number of emigrants and the level of remittances received are associated with increasing
income from business activities. In Fiji, by contrast, remittances do not seem to affect business
income and have a negative relationship with
wage earnings—as if migration just served as a
substitute for wage employment in the domestic
economy. 56

Note: GDP = gross domestic product. Nineteen small island nations are included in panel a on migration and 15 small island nations in panel b on remittances. The variation of
remittances in Pacific Island countries over time is driven by missing data from Samoa.

Migration does not always lead to a win-win
situation, however. For example, large remittance flows raise the prospect of Dutch disease—the appreciation of the real exchange rate
due to the abundance of foreign currency. Brain
drain is also a salient feature in these countries,
at least in the short term. Their migrants are
more educated than their general population. In
12 of 19 small island nations, more than 30 percent of total emigrants are skilled workers; in 14
of them, skilled emigrants represent more than
40 percent of the domestic skilled population.57
While these migrants experience large income
gains, send substantial remittances back, and do
transfer knowledge, they do not appear to trade
with their home countries or invest in them to
any large degree.58 In Caribbean countries, the
outmigration of health personnel has raised
particular concerns because of its negative impact on health systems.
On the other hand, migration and remittances can promote human capital accumulation. The possibility to migrate may motivate
greater investments in education, and remittances may finance them. Short-term migration
can offer workers better training and education
opportunities, which adds to domestic human

capital stock once the migrants return.59 Evidence from Fiji suggests that migration opportunities increase the probability that household
members will acquire tertiary education.60 Results from qualitative surveys in Fiji also indicate
that workers are prompted to acquire special
skills for migration.61
Viable jobs in small islands are traditionally
associated with the exploitation of natural resources including fisheries, forestry, mining, and
tourism. When niche opportunities exist, low
business costs become less critical for attracting investment. In Fiji, sugar production and
tourism are the largest sources of employment.
As the most important agribusiness, sugar production contributes about 8 percent of exports
and employs over 10 percent of total population. Annually, half a million visitors come to
Fiji, while the local population is less than one
million. Tourism has become a main source of
employment growth in the formal sector.62
The reliance on natural resources, however,
raises the vulnerability of these countries. These
sectors tend to be more susceptible to natural shocks—both natural disasters and volatile
rainfall patterns. As with geographical disadvantages, policies cannot eradicate the vulnerability.

205

206

But jobs exploiting natural resources should not
undermine the fragile ecosystem of the islands.
When conducted in a sustainable manner, tourism and fisheries have positive environmental
impacts.
Ensuring a broad distribution of the rents
from jobs in the natural resource sectors is
challenging. For example, Vanuatu’s impressive growth has not had an impact on the lives
of most residents. The country’s development
has been driven by foreign investment in tourism, financial services, and land development,
and only a relatively small proportion of the
urban population is reaping the gains. This has
increased inequality and may lead to disruptive
social trends.63
A closer look at the Mauritius miracle
shows how small island nations might be able
to diversify into activities not based on the exploitation of natural resources. Between 1977
and 2009, real GDP grew at 5.1 percent a year
in Mauritius, compared with 3.2 percent for
Sub-Saharan Africa overall. The World Economic Forum ranks Mauritius as the secondmost-competitive country in the region. This
sustained growth has been accompanied by a
profound structural transformation over time.
Poor at independence in 1968, Mauritius has
transitioned from a sugar economy to manufacturing textiles and apparel to knowledge-

intensive services in tourism, finance, and information communication technologies.64
Many explanations have been offered for the
Mauritius miracle. There is no doubt that the
focus on trade and foreign direct investment,
and on using export processing zones to target
light manufacturing industries, has been a critical element of Mauritius’ success. The country
also boasts low corruption levels and a favorable
regulatory environment, coupled with strong
public-private sector cooperation and flexible
institutions.65 But the circumstances that allowed Mauritius to embark on this remarkable development path were exceptional. They
included the quota system that used to govern
garment exports. Other small island nations
may not enjoy such opportunities these days.
Small island nations face unique difficulties because they cannot benefit from the gains
of scale or specialization. These difficulties are
intensified in places such as the Pacific island
countries, which are far from major centers of
economic activity. The experience of Mauritius
shows what might be possible with strategic policies, strong institution building, and a dose of
luck. But for many small island states, establishing links with nearby economic centers, maximizing the benefits of migration, and exploiting
niche markets while preserving their fragile ecosystem point the way forward.

Countries with high youth
unemployment
Young people are much more likely to be unemployed than older adults. In most countries,
unemployment rates for youth, defined as 15–
24 years old, are usually between two and three
times the overall unemployment rate (figure
6.5). And the unemployment rate captures only
one aspect of the problems young people face in

countries, for example, open unemployment is
low and youth employment difficulties are likely
to manifest themselves in poor job quality and
low earnings. In countries with high youth unemployment, job quality may be a problem for
those young people who do find work. In the
Arab Republic of Egypt, informality is two times
more common among 15- to 24-year-old workers than among 35- to 54-year-olds.66 Highly

segmented labor markets offer limited scope
to make the transition from informal to formal
jobs. In Tunisia, even in those sectors that largely
employ youth labor, employment is often temporary and informal.67
The stakes in youth unemployment are
high. Recent events in the Arab world and in
southern Europe have highlighted the discontent of educated youth whose employment opportunities are falling short of expectations.
The Arab Spring may boost transparency and
accountability in the region, but if jobs do not
follow, greater instability may result.68 Youth
employment problems have economic costs,
not only in the short run but also in the longer term. Unemployment among young people
can lead to permanent scarring effects in the
form of lower future earnings.69 The lack of
job opportunities may also lead to discouragement. Some of the decline in youth unemployment in the aftermath of the global crisis is actually driven by young people dropping out of
the labor force.70
Many countries with youth unemployment
problems have very large youth cohorts. In
Zimbabwe, where 43 percent of the workingage population is between 15 and 24, the youth
unemployment rate is three times higher than
the overall unemployment rate. The Middle
East and North Africa, which has especially high
youth unemployment, is an overwhelmingly
young region. More than 100 million people are
between the ages of 15 and 29, making up 30
percent of the region’s population and about 47
percent of the working-age population. Youth
cohorts this large are not only likely to face
higher unemployment rates but also tend to exert downward pressure on labor earnings.71
But demography is far from the whole story.
Not all countries with pressing youth employment problems have “youth bulges.” In Sri
Lanka, less than one-quarter of the working age
population is between 15 and 24, but the youth
unemployment rate is more than three times the
overall rate. And even where youth cohorts are
large, young people may encounter other barriers to employment. Poor information on job
seekers and on employment opportunities is
one reason why young people face more difficulties than adults in finding jobs. Where private
and public agencies and other sources of labor
market information are not well developed,
personal networks are important for match-

ing people and jobs. A majority of workers in
most Middle Eastern and North African countries have found their jobs through family and
friends.72 Adults tend to have better networks
than young people going through the transition from education to employment. If a large
percentage of a person’s network is unemployed,
the chances of that person finding a job are low.
A skills mismatch is the other common
explanation. Close to 40 percent of the firms
surveyed through investment climate assess­
ments in the Middle East and North Africa
report that the limited availability of skilled
labor is a major constraint on business. Lack
of formal schooling, which has increased substantially in the region, is not the cause. In fact,
youth unemployment rates tend to rise with
educational attainment in many countries. In
Morocco, young people with a university education had an unemployment rate in 2009 of
17 percent, 3.7 times the rate for those with
primary education or less. In Tunisia, 23 percent of university-educated youth were unemployed in 2010, compared with 11 percent for
nongraduates.73 In Tunisia, it takes graduates 28
months on average to find a job, compared with
19 months for nongraduates.74 Not only has un-

employment been increasing, but the employment deficit is expected to grow more among
university graduates than among people with
less education (figure 6.6).
The paradox of high unemployment among
the highly educated is related to the growth
path of countries in the Middle East and North
Africa, where the civil service and state-owned
enterprises have long been the employers of
choice and education systems were built to
feed them with staff. Students aspire to public
sector jobs, where benefits are generous and
employment is stable, and focus on obtaining
academic credentials rather than skills that enhance employability.75 There is a striking difference between the preferred educational path
of youth in the region and that of youth in the
high-performing East Asian countries. In 2009,
one-quarter or less of the university students in
Algeria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia were majoring in science, technology, or engineering.76 In
some East Asian countries, such as China, the
Republic of Korea, and Malaysia, that share was
more than two-fifths.77
Prescriptions on how to address the jobs
challenge in countries with high youth unem-

ployment usually build on these two explanations. The poor flow of information between
employers and jobseekers is seen as a justification for active labor market policies that focus
on improving the match between labor supply
and demand. Counseling can help jobseekers
understand what they have to offer and where
the opportunities are. Temporary employment
programs may provide a first job and make employers realize the value of a young worker. As
for skills, the contrast between high educational
attainment and high unemployment rates is
seen as an indication of a disconnect between
the quality and relevance of schooling and the
actual needs of the labor market. Improving
youth employment prospects, it is argued, will
critically depend on restructuring education
and training systems to produce marketable
skills rather than credentials.78 In the short term,
training programs are indeed the most obvious
response to provide unemployed youth with the
practical skills employers need.
The potential impact of these prescriptions
is limited, however. Better information, counseling, and temporary employment programs
can certainly help some jobseekers, but whether

	

they would make a major dent in the aggregate
unemployment rate is unclear. Better matches
between jobseekers and employment opportunities would result in large increases in total
employment only if there were many unfilled
vacancies. But that is not the case in the Middle
East and North Africa. Part of the high unemployment rate among graduates stems from
the fact that the demand for skilled labor derives mainly from public administration, where
growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and
by increasing privatization and deregulation.79
Meanwhile, the main sources of private sector
growth (such as construction and low-valueadded services) demand unskilled workers, for
the most part.80
The problem is similar with training programs. Educated youth have the capacity to
learn quickly. If employers wanted it, they could
even provide on-the-job training as needed. But
training may not change aspirations.
Despite its diminishing absorption capacity,
the public sector in the Middle East and North
Africa region remains the main client of the
higher education system and thus shapes student expectations and choices. The public sector
still accounts for about one-third of overall employment in countries such as the Arab Republic
of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and the Republic of Yemen.81 In some of these countries, public sector
employment has recorded modest growth in
recent years, but budgetary pressures will inevitably result in a severe contraction in the future.
Aspirations remain, however, and, for many of
the unemployed youth who have pursued university education in the expectation of getting
a public sector job, there is a sense of a broken
promise.
Information, counseling, and training are
unlikely to overcome this frustration. Addressing
the jobs challenge of countries with high youth
unemployment rates requires a dynamic private
sector that can create employment opportunities commensurate with the education and aspirations of new entrants to the labor market.
Growth alone may not be enough. After all,
few countries have had a better economic performance than Tunisia, the first country in the
Arab world in which jobs discontent erupted
into political turmoil. Between 2000 and 2010,
its GDP expanded at an average annual rate of
almost 5 percent; meanwhile, the overall unem-

Diverse jobs agendas   

ployment rate remained at 14 percent or above,
and the rate for university graduates exceeded
30 percent.
The key questions are why growth in Tunisia
and other countries with high youth unemployment has not been more labor intensive and
why the sectors that have expanded the most
rely on unskilled workers. The answers may be
in the product market more than in the labor
market. Although many countries in the region
have implemented reforms to reduce red tape
and improve the overall business climate, discretion, arbitrariness, and unequal treatment
still hinder competition and private sector development, especially in skills-intensive sectors
such as telecommunications. In many countries
in the Middle East and North Africa, connections with political power may matter more
for success than entrepreneurial capacity.82 The
perks often extend to the workers in these cosseted businesses, under the form of job security
and other benefits, adding to the frustration of
those left out.
Firm dynamics provide some evidence of
the difficulties associated with job creation and
employment growth in these countries. Rates
of new firm registration are low in most countries in the region.83 And even when they do get
started, small firms face barriers in growing into
sizable companies. The vast majority of Tunisian formal firms are small: 86 percent of them
are one-person entities, and only 0.4 percent
have 100 workers or more. But these large firms
account for more than one-third of all jobs,
more than all the one-person firms combined.
A study of their dynamics over a decade shows
that micro- and small firms hardly ever become
large firms. Moreover, one-person firms only
very rarely graduate into the small size category,
and many are likely to shut down.84
While countries with high youth unemployment may face a large youth bulge or education
quality issues, problems are often on the demand side, with limited competition reducing
employment opportunities, especially for highly
skilled youth. Many countries in the Middle East
and North Africa would have greater scope to
generate more jobs for young people if the barriers to firm entry and growth were eased. This
prospect is unlikely to materialize, however, as
long as political connections remain more important than entrepreneurial capacity to enter

209

210

into the modern sector. Ending privilege, more
than improving labor market matching or upgrading skills, is thus the priority for countries
with high youth unemployment. Dynamism in
more skills-intensive sectors would lead to faster
growth by putting educated youth to work. It

would result in higher living standards by reducing the burden protected activities put on
others. And it would reinforce a sense of fairness in society—a sense that young people can
get ahead by what they know rather than who
they know.

Formalizing economies
The challenge of formalization is present in
economies where a large share of the labor force
is already covered by labor legislation and social
protection programs, and reaching universal
coverage seems attainable. But going in that direction raises serious tradeoffs. Formalization
is often seen as necessary to strengthen social
cohesion. It is also bound to increase the living
standards of those who get under the purview
of labor law and gain access to social protection.
But formalization may reduce productivity if it
distorts incentives or puts a burden on firms.
Formalizing economies are characterized
by already large or growing urban populations
where many residents have incomes well above
poverty levels, yet where many still work in
informal employment. The emerging middle
classes in these economies demand advanced
public services, including tertiary education,
health care, and pensions. They are often frustrated by poor governance. They may perceive
taxes and public sector benefits as useless or
unfair and resent the weak physical and institutional infrastructure, as well as the excessive regulatory load. These frustrations beget
avoidance and evasion of regulations, and, in
such a climate, informal jobs not only persist
but can even proliferate.85
This state of affairs, sometimes described as
an informality trap, reflects a weak social contract.86 That a large share of a country’s urban
labor force is informal is sometimes interpreted

Jobs not supported through rents
Jobs not allocated on the basis of connections

as a sign that the state is unable to enforce regulations and citizens are unwilling to comply with
them.87
The prevalence of informal employment in
these relatively advanced economies can nurture poverty and social exclusion.88 Almost by
definition, informal workers lack legal job protections and social insurance coverage, making
them more vulnerable to workplace abuses,
health risks, and the vagaries of the business
cycle. Informal workers face a higher probability of poverty and often perceive themselves as
poor.89 Men represent a majority of informal
workers, but the probability for them to work
in the informal sector is generally lower than
for women, making informality another source
of gender inequality. In Peru, informality rates
are 76 and 66 percent for women and men, respectively. In South Africa, the corresponding
rates are 37 and 30 percent. The Arab Republic
of Egypt is a notable exception, with rates of 23
and 54 percent, respectively.90
Informality is also associated with low productivity. Most informal workers are either
­self-employed or work for small unregistered
firms, with low capital per worker, limited technology, and no scale economies. In Turkey, the
differential in total factor productivity between
formal and informal firms is 19 percent in manufacturing and 62 percent in services.91 A study
in six Latin American countries finds that labor
productivity is 30 percent higher in formal firms
than in informal firms.92 The use of public services by the informal sector, without proper tax

	

contributions, puts a burden on formal firms
and lowers their productivity as well.93
It does not follow that formalization alone
would increase productivity. Evidence shows that
firms do not become more profitable simply by
formalizing.94 Low productivity may reflect selfselection by workers and firms, who choose
whether to formalize depending on the balance
between the associated benefits and costs. For
many workers, the poor quality of social protection and the possibility of relying on others in
case of adverse shocks may make informal sector
employment a preferred alternative. An analysis
of labor market dynamics in Brazil and Mexico
confirms that a substantial part of the informal
sector workforce, particularly the self-employed,
appears to voluntarily exit from the formal sector.95 Self-selection also occurs in the case of
firms. A business tax reduction and simplification adopted in Brazil in 1996 led to a significant
increase in formality among microenterprises.96
In other cases, workers with limited access to
asset accumulation find themselves trapped in
low-productivity informal jobs or use this sector as a last resort to escape unemployment. In
Colombia and Argentina, evidence shows that
a large share of workers, particularly low-skill
workers, are systematically less likely to work in
the formal sector despite being willing to work in
it.97 In any case, informality is clearly a multilayered phenomenon with some workers trapped
in this sector and others self-selecting into it.98
Personal views about informality are actually very diverse.99 For example, some participants in a focus group of young women from a
better-off neighborhood in Durban, South
Africa, associated good jobs with formal occupations such as doctor, lawyer, teacher, nurse, or
police woman: “Being a police-woman is a good
way to make a living because they get benefits
and they help protect the community.” Other
participants, from a poorer neighborhood, identified good jobs as those in farming (“because
you can sell the veggies”) or sewing (“because
you can make a lot of money”). But other informal sector jobs were seen as bad because they involved financial precariousness and hard working conditions. Among them were working as a
domestic worker (“because you have to go door
to door asking people if they have a job for you.
. . . [They] would pay you R30 and say because
you are just helping”) or cutting grass (“because

In the long run, the informal sector tends to
be larger in countries where labor productivity
is lower, government services are weaker, and
the business environment is less flexible.100 A
controversial question is how much labor market and business regulations actually contribute
to informality.101 Responses by firms surveyed
in investment climate assessments suggest that
labor legislation is not necessarily the main
cause of informality, not because the laws and
regulations are irrelevant, but because they are
regarded with irreverence. Corruption and taxations are seen as the most vexing obstacles firms
face (figure 6.7). Recent research also indicates

The debate on how to reduce informality is intense in Mexico

Having at least one member working in the formal sector allows
Mexican families to have a regular source of income, health coverage for all, and, through these, access to the support of social networks. A case study, based on both ethnographic and statistical
evidence, makes the case that households whose members fail to
secure formal jobs are more likely to fall into poverty because of the
risk of catastrophic health expenses. They are also less likely to
secure social support from relatives and neighbors.a Formal employment is thus critical for living standards in Mexico.
Despite a GDP per capita around US$14,000 in purchasing
power parity terms, Mexico’s informal employment has ranged
from 50 to 62 percent of total employment depending on the definition used. This rate is considered high given the country’s development level and has not shown consistent signs of decline in
nearly two decades. Several studies argue that restrictive labor legislation is a factor explaining Mexico’s large informal economy.b The
country has tried unsuccessfully to reform its main labor law, which
was enacted in 1973 and which is tied to rights enshrined in the
1917 constitution.
Weak enforcement is another factor behind informality in Mexico. The government announced a doubling of inspectors at the
Ministry of Labor in 2012, from 300 to 600. This number still compares unfavorably with other countries.c Labor courts are also overstretched: cases may take between three and six years to reach a
conclusion.d
This stagnation in the reform of legislation and enforcement
contrasts with the expansion of a successful cash transfer program,
Oportunidades, and a noncontributory social insurance program,

Seguro Popular. Oportunidades covers nearly one-fifth of the total
population and nearly all the rural poor, making it one of the besttargeted poverty reduction programs in the country. Seguro Popular is the most rapidly growing program, claiming a coverage of
more than 50 million by April 2012.e But some preliminary research
finds that non-contributory programs in general, and Seguro Popular, in particular, may induce informality or, at least, discourage formal employment.f
Meanwhile, the debate about the universalization of health
insurance is very much alive in Mexico. Academics and policy makers argue over it, and it is also a topic of political controversy. Much
­pivots on how much universalization will cost. Estimates vary widely
from no incremental costs because of efficiency and tax collection
gains to relatively large costs when accounting for long-term demographic changes. These differences originate from different methodologies, which indicate the complexity of the topic and the difficulty in gauging the full implications of the reform.g
Mexico’s debate on formalization needs to be cast in a broader
context. In recent years, poverty and unemployment have increased
while real wages have been stagnant. But other measures of wellbeing, such as access to education, health, and social security, have
continued to improve.h Average productivity has been growing, but
slowly, which can be due to an excessive churning of jobs and firms.i
Demographic trends still show high fertility rates for a large share of
the population, which leads to a social reproduction of poverty and
informality.j Whether sweeping changes in labor and tax legislation
as well as in the organization of social protection would substantially reduce informality is still an open question.

that it is business regulations, more than labor
regulations, that help explain changes in informality and unemployment.102
Addressing the jobs challenge faced by formalizing economies requires extending social
protection and the purview of labor laws without choking off economic dynamism. Previous
attempts by Latin American countries to formalize through heavy-handed regulation, mandated benefits, and ill-designed social insurance
programs led to populist enthusiasm but also to
lower productivity and eventually to economic
stagnation and poor quality of social protection.

Efforts to reduce informality have taken a new
twist in recent years. In several Latin American
countries, sweeping changes in the organization
of social protection are being implemented or
proposed. First, transfer programs have esca­lated. Brazil and Mexico introduced cash transfer programs in the late 1990s that now cover
nearly one-fifth of their populations.103 Brazil,
Chile, and Mexico have also introduced noncontributory programs for senior citizens, and
other countries are following suit. More radically, policy makers are debating whether to
make the coverage of social insurance universal,

moving away from the current contributory
systems toward the funding of benefits from
general tax revenue.104 This reform would certainly expand the number of beneficiaries, but
whether it would encourage firms to formalize
is a matter of intense debate, especially in Mexico (box 6.7).105
So far, few countries have managed to substantially reduce informality. Rapid growth and
strengthening institutions in Brazil and Chile
have made them recent exceptions. In both
cases, changes in labor market regulation have
had limited effect. Patient accumulation of human capital and sustained growth have paid off.
But strengthened rule of law, effective policies,
and a better perception of the role of the state
have also helped.
Those who see informality as the outcome of
a weak social compact argue that the way forward involves a combination of enhanced enforcement of regulations, improved quality of
public services, and greater policy coherence.106
If informality is associated with production
units that evade, elude, or stay outside regu-

lation, a three-pronged strategy may be warranted.107 For those who clearly work outside
the purview of regulations, the reach of human
development and social protection services and
activation policies should be expanded. For
those who work in stunted firms that legally
avoid becoming formal, regulations should be
simplified and their burden eased. Finally, for
those in firms that evade regulations, enforcement should be strengthened. For this threepronged strategy to have a chance of success,
workers and employers need to perceive the
state as a reliable and fair partner. If the state
is not able to generate a sense of trust through
the provision of efficient and good-quality services, neither regulatory reform nor increased
enforcement will succeed in increasing formalization substantially.
The key is to build formal institutions and
programs that are not too costly and that are
valued by workers. The jobs agenda of formalizing economies is closely linked, then, to the
development of effective regulation and social
protection systems.

Aging societies
Declining fertility rates and, in many countries,
rising life expectancy have led to rapidly aging
populations in several regions of the world. Today’s aging societies are concentrated in industrial countries, in Eastern Europe, and in the
Southern Cone of Latin America. China entered
the aging phase in 2010; and India, the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Singapore, and Thailand will
experience significant aging in the relatively
near future.108
The old-age dependency ratio measures the
number of people 65 years or older in relation
to the number of people in the working-age
population (15 to 64 years). When this ratio is
high, the working-age population faces pressure

to generate income to meet the needs of the elderly generation. The old-age dependency ratio
in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in Singapore will rise almost fivefold between now and
2050. These two countries will have four and six
­elderly people, respectively, for every ten 15- to
64-year-olds. China’s old-age dependency ratio
will rise by a factor of almost four. Many already
aging societies in Eastern Europe as well as in
Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, will experience
a rise in the ratio—a doubling or even more in
most cases—between now and 2050.
The reasons for these surges in dependency
ratios vary across countries. In most, the elderly
live longer; in some, there are fewer people of
working age. Low fertility rates in Bulgaria contributed to a population decline of 15 percent

2050.

between 1990 and 2010—and by 2050, the
country is projected to have lost almost 40 percent of its population compared with its peak in
the mid-1980s. Other Eastern European countries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova,
Romania, and Ukraine, are expected to follow
the same pattern; China’s population will be 50
million less in 2050 than it is now. In India and
Singapore and in the Southern Cone countries
of Latin America, population growth is slowing
down and will start to decline by the middle of
the century.
If the labor force participation rates of older
workers are significant today and if these levels can be maintained, the impact of aging on
average income can be cushioned considerably.
But that may not be enough. If age-specific participation rates remain constant, some countries, such as Thailand, would be able to limit
the absolute decline in its labor force, but many
others would not. The impact in many Eastern
European countries, Cuba, and China would be
stark because of the decline in the size of the
working age population. Between 2011 and
2050, Bulgaria would face a 40 percent drop in

its workforce, Poland 28 percent, and China 17
percent (figure 6.8).109
Aging affects jobs through several channels.110 Lower fertility may imply higher numbers of women ready to seek and take up jobs,
although little evidence of this has been o
­ bserved
in Eastern Europe over the past 20 years. Smaller
cohorts of young people could reduce innovative capacity. Disability rates increase in older
age groups and thus further affect the labor
supply in aging populations.111 Understanding
how aggregate savings will be affected is also
important, given that savings drive investment,
growth, and job creation. Savings typically decline among older age groups. This decline
could be offset if young people were to build up
additional buffers to support their longer life
spans, especially if public retirement schemes
prove unsustainable or are absent. Expenditure
patterns also vary with age. The rapid rise in the
long-term care industry in high-income countries is an example. In the United States, the industry now counts more than 3 million formal
jobs, and an estimated 10 million Americans

parents.112
Raising productivity is ultimately essential
for maintaining living standards in aging societies where fewer people are working. In many
Eastern European countries, the productivity
gains required would be substantial (figure 6.9).
If they do not materialize, falling living standards will threaten those population groups that
are vulnerable to poverty.113
Through jobs, aging also impacts intergenerational relations and social cohesion. Migration and aging have put stress on the traditional
family-based support systems for China’s rural elderly, raising the possibility that they will
have to continue working at later ages and will
not have assistance, financial or otherwise, from
their children.114 The older generation can feel
not only neglected, but also excluded. In Poland,
a 55-year old man felt that “age is a great barrier.
I’ve submitted my CV and they tell me I am too
old, they tell me if you were 35 years old we could
hire you. I have 20 years of experience and they
expect me to be 35 years old?”115
Social security and health systems in many
aging middle- and higher-income countries
are barely sustainable as currently designed.
Systems inspired by the Bismarckian model,
where social welfare and insurance are financed
through labor taxes on a pay-as-you-go basis,
are particularly vulnerable. A decline in the contribution base shrinks the resources available
for pensions and health care at the same time
that an increasing elderly population makes
more claims on both systems. The health care
cost for people age 70 years and above, with
higher disability prevalence rates, is two to three
times higher than the cost for people of prime
working age.116 While education expenditures
may fall in many aging countries in the medium
term, that in itself will bring about further—
and often painful—adjustments as schools close
and teachers lose their jobs.
The magnitude of adjustments needed in
social welfare systems is daunting. In a representative Eastern European country, the public
pension system alone could reach a deficit of almost 7 percent of GDP in 2050 compared with
2 percent today.117 To balance the accounts, the
retirement age would need to increase or the
ratio of pension benefits to earnings at retirement would have to be cut, or some combination of the two. Such changes could cause mate-

rial hardship for elderly people. The adjustment
process itself is likely to be painful economically,
socially, and politically. The experience of several high-income countries shows that implementing the necessary reforms can stretch social
cohesion to the limit.
Aging also can make a society less mobile,
which can have economic consequences. In
Ukraine, for example, aging is taking place
against a relatively high pre-crisis level of
growth with very little creation of jobs. Some
firms, though, are desperately looking for workers, both highly skilled and manual. The elderly
are usually less mobile than the young, and the
housing market makes changing residence difficult. Low internal mobility represents a significant bottleneck to increasing activity and
raising productivity (box 6.8).
In aging societies like Ukraine, good jobs for
development are those that keep labor force participation rates high, especially for the elderly.
These jobs can contain the decline in average
income while at the same time protecting the viability of the social insurance system, which, in
many countries, is under significant fiscal stress.
Through these two channels, such jobs would
also contribute to supporting social cohesion.

BOX 6.8 

In Ukraine, the impact of aging is compounded by migration and declining fertility

Ukraine’s population is shrinking. This country, which stretches from
the heavily industrialized Russian-speaking east to the more agricultural and predominantly Ukrainian-speaking west, was home to 52
million people when the Soviet Union broke apart. Today, there are
6 million fewer people; by 2050, the population will have fallen to 35
million. Fertility rates are sharply down, from about 2.0 at the end of
the 1990s to below 1.5 today, albeit with an upward tick in recent
years. The elderly dependency ratio is 22 percent and will reach
more than 40 percent over the next 30 years.
The effect of this population aging on jobs is amplified by international migration. Between the turbulent transition years and the
middle of the last decade, about 2.5 million Ukrainians emigrated,
mainly to the Russian Federation and Western Europe. Every year,
around 80,000 people leave the country,a and recent studies have
shown that the possible positive impacts of migration through
remittances, return migration, and diaspora involvement have not
(yet) shown their desired impacts.b People ages 25–29 years, especially women, are withdrawing in large numbers from the labor market: the female participation rate dropped from 78.1 percent to 70.9
percent between 2001 and 2010.c
Achieving high degrees of efficiency in the labor market is key to
counterbalancing the impact of aging. But regional labor markets

show little integration, as reflected by the high dispersion of unemployment rates. In some parts of the country, employers complain
bitterly about the lack of workers with adequate skills, and at the
same time they cannot fill available unskilled jobs. Yet, internal
mobility is low in Ukraine by international standards and has
declined in recent years. The lack of affordable housing has emerged
as major barrier to mobility, also hindering registration for benefits
in new locations. Rental property is scarce, often expensive, and can
absorb up to 50 percent of household incomes in the big cities.d
Eventually, Ukraine may face a vicious jobs circle. A declining
labor force and a lackluster productivity performance put the social
insurance and welfare systems at risk of becoming unsustainable.
The inability to provide benefits to an aging population, and the
stress that reforming the system could bring about, could become a
source of social tension. As participants in focus group discussions
mentioned, this tension would be amplified by the perception that
the distribution of jobs is unfair and that jobs in the public sector
require bribes.e The decline in employment rates could also undermine civic engagement. Although low, the level of political and
community participation among the employed is about twice as
high as among the unemployed and 25 percent higher than among
the inactive population.f

The development of home-care models for the
elderly can also support the twin objectives of
keeping a high employment rate and containing
social insurance costs. Proactively attracting—
and integrating—migrants and managing to
create virtuous circles with the diaspora promises equally large returns.
Measures such as raising the retirement age
can contribute to labor force participation and

financing of the welfare system, but not all
groups have the same life expectancy. Typically,
professional, technical, and skilled workers
can expect to live longer than manual workers, especially those in hazardous occupations.
Keeping the skilled at work longer is a way to
increase average labor productivity and offset
the decline in employment rates.

A targeted investment climate?

Creating an investment climate conducive to job
creation in the private sector is a top policy priority. The question is whether the government
should aim for a level playing field or focus its
efforts on the specific areas, types of activities,
firm sizes, and sectors with the greatest potential to create good jobs for development. Jobs
challenges vary depending on a country’s level
of development, its endowments, its demography, and its institutions. Ensuring free entry and
competition across all sectors is a fundamental
requisite for growth. But given the often limited fiscal space and administrative capacity of
developing countries, creating an enabling business environment across the entire economy can
be challenging, and the relevant question is how
policy priorities should be set.
The conventional wisdom views targeting
with a skepticism that stems from often disastrous experiences with industrial policy. While
targeting was common in Latin America during
its import substitution phase, by the 1980s the
consensus was that interventions favoring specific sectors led to rent seeking, economic stagnation, and external vulnerability. Slow growth
in India until the 1990s was also attributed to
policies that favored local industrial groups and
undermined competition. The success of several
East Asian countries in industrializing has reignited the debate on the merits of targeting and
the role of the state, but the potential for institutional failures remains the main concern.118 The
dominant view holds that policy makers lack
both the information and the capacity to “pick
winners” when they select activities to target. In
the absence of a solid information base, and taking into account the institutional failures common in developing countries, a risk exists that
potential beneficiaries from targeted support
could unduly influence the decision process.

Targeting is not necessarily industrial
policy
The investment climate is the set of public goods
and public policies that shape the opportunities
and incentives for firms to invest productively,
create jobs, and expand.119 It encompasses a wide

range of policy levers: ensuring stability and security, enhancing financial markets, providing
infrastructure services, reducing regulatory and
tax burdens, and improving the quality of the
workforce. The natural inclination is to equate
a targeted investment climate with industrial
policy. If some activities result in large productivity spillovers (because of learning-by-doing,
for instance, or because of greater specialization
and integration), targeting can imply supporting such activities. In recent years, productivity
spillovers associated with various activities have
been reexamined from different viewpoints,
with both academics and practitioners proposing practical approaches for their identification
(box 6.9).
The targeting of the investment climate
may not necessarily be aimed at industrial sectors, however. Targeting can focus on gender, as
when policies aim to increase labor market participation by women, or on spatial concerns, as
in urbanization policies or policies for regional
development. Or it can focus on firm size, as
when policies support the development of small
and medium enterprises. Good jobs for development differ across countries. The jobs agenda
may involve making smallholder farming more
productive in an agrarian economy, preserving
international competitiveness in a resource-rich
country, or fostering competition in activities
employing skilled labor in a country with high
youth unemployment. In each case, the logic for
targeting lies in tackling market imperfections
or government failures that are preventing jobs
from contributing more to development.
An example is targeting in the agricultural
sector. The underlying logic is based on the
notion of public goods. The biggest obstacles
to agricultural development are the lack of
appropriate technologies and adequate infrastructures. As arable land becomes scarce, the
development of yield-enhancing technologies is
indispensable.120 But incentives to generate these
technologies are undermined because they can
be replicated freely.121 Thus, public policy plays
a role by supporting the development and dissemination of such technologies. Because yieldenhancing technologies are fertilizer intensive

Once again, the debate rages over industrial policy

Industrial policy is an approach to state economic stewardship in
which direct support is given to particular sectors in pursuit of
national goals. Industrial policy fell out of favor in the 1980s, but
today it is getting recognition again. The emerging views, however,
draw criticism and have led to a new round of debate.
Arguments for industrial policy rest on three types of market
failures: knowledge spillovers and dynamic scale economies, coordination failures, and information externalities. In the first, industrial
policy is derived from the observation that knowledge spillovers
and dynamic scale economies differ across industries. Coordination
failures arise when markets fail to correctly signal the future payoffs
of investment projects, such as large-scale infrastructure projects,
and the private sector tends to underinvest on its own. Information
externalities exist when knowledge on the profitability of investment opportunities is limited and the risk of free riding discourages
investment and innovation.
Building on these rationales, several approaches further develop
thinking on industrial policy. The New Structural Economics stresses
the shift in comparative advantage that results from changes in
endowments. The large productivity spillovers from infrastructure
and associated coordination failures justify a leading role for the
state. To identify the industries to be supported, this approach proposes to learn from countries with similar endowments but somewhat higher income levels. Exports with a solid track record by
these countries indicate which sectors could have a comparative
advantage as the economy grows.a

A second approach emphasizes the policy process and especially public-private partnerships. In this view, the dialogue between
the government and businesses can help to overcome coordination
failures and elicit information from the private sector on the most
relevant productivity spillovers.b
For a third school of thought, what matters is not just any coordination failure or externality, but spillovers of productive knowledge—mastering ways of doing things. Such knowledge is different
from codified, public knowledge and is acquired and accumulated
through experience. This approach claims that spillovers of productive knowledge associated with different industries can be sizable.
To identify industries worth supporting, the approach proposes to
rank products by how much productive knowledge is embedded in
them and to focus on products that are similar to what is being produced currently but embody a higher knowledge content.c
Opponents of industrial policy cast doubts on its alleged rationales, but above all, they question the practicality of its implementation. For instance, while admitting the existence of potentially sizable knowledge spillovers and dynamic scale economies in certain
industries, skeptics question the whether the public sector has the
capacity to identify these industries. A related concern is the ability
of the public sector to make industrial policy a dynamic process:
applying credible sunset clauses to old industries, and reallocating
resources to new industries. More generally, skeptics believe the
knowledge and skill requirements for successful implementation
exceed the capacity of the public sector. d

and sensitive to the availability of water, public
investments in infrastructure—including roads
and irrigation facilities—are often essential. The
Brazilian government, for example, viewed investment in adaptive agricultural research as a
prerequisite for development. It therefore supported a research corporation (EMBRAPA) that
focused on technology generation and transfer
and played a critical role in the success of the
Brazilian agribusiness sector.122
The emergence of dynamic cities is another
case in point. From Dublin to Shanghai, competitiveness initiatives increasingly involve cities, more than countries. This shift is a result
of agglomeration effects: the level playing field
evokes a flat world, whereas urbanization policies correspond to a world with spikes of economic activity. Dynamic cities may offer more
favorable tax treatment, easy access to land,
simplified administrative procedures, and sup-

port for public-private partnerships. More efficient logistics and public investments in major
infrastructure facilities usually complement the
package of incentives. A recent version of spatial
targeting is the idea of charter cities: to attract
businesses to a country with low credibility in
the eyes of foreign investors, sovereignty of a
city could be handed over to another country in
exchange for the enforcement of a credible set
of rules.123 The objective is to strengthen the investment climate in a small part of the country,
potentially providing a demonstration effect for
further reforms, while not threatening the rents
of powerful local elites elsewhere.

The information base for targeting exists
When there is clarity on the challenges faced
by a country, it is also possible to determine
which types of jobs would help address these

	

Diverse jobs agendas   

challenges. Thanks to efforts in research and
data collection, the information set for deciding whether and how to support the creation of
more of those good jobs for development is far
from empty.
Consider jobs in farming. Among staple
crops, rice, wheat, and maize are more promising than sorghum and millet, but the latter crops
are grown in drier and harsher conditions where
farmers are particularly poor.124 Modern cereal
varieties are high yielding primarily in favorable
rain-fed and irrigated areas.125 Thus, agricultural policies are bound to affect the well-being
of the rural population differently in different
regions. The choice depends on the country’s
natural endowments and societal goals.126
In nonagricultural sectors, the main obstacles to job creation can be identified through
quantitative and qualitative assessments of the
constraints faced by enterprises. While these assessments need to be interpreted with caution,
differences in responses across enterprises reveal
patterns that can also be used for developing
targeted policy interventions (box 6.10).127
If creating competitive cities is a feature of
a country’s jobs agenda, enterprise surveys can
provide information on how different the constraints faced by businesses are in cities of different sizes (figure 6.10a). If the jobs agenda

BOX 6.10 

requires the inflow of foreign direct investment,
enterprise surveys indicate that foreign companies are less concerned about finance, but view
customs administration, transportation, and
licensing as more severe impediments to firm
activity and growth (figure 6.10b). One country may choose to focus on microenterprises,
because their success contributes to poverty
reduction, and another on young and large
firms, because they tend to be the most innovative. In both cases, enterprise surveys can be
used to uncover the most relevant constraints
(figure 6.10c, 6.10d). For example, shortages of
skilled labor, delays in customs, and stringent
labor regulations are viewed as more severe constraints by medium and large enterprises than
by smaller companies. In contrast, micro- and
small enterprises consider access to finance and
competition to be more serious obstacles to
their growth. Recently, enterprise surveys have
been conducted for household enterprises operating in rural areas in selected countries. They
can serve as additional tools for countries to foster nonagricultural sectors in rural areas.128
The effects of removing those constraints
also differ across businesses. Reducing barriers
to entry fosters the growth of industries that experience higher natural turnover rates. Improving access to finance stimulates the development

Caution is needed when interpreting results from enterprise surveys

Surveys of entrepreneurs and senior managers can provide feedback on what the private sector sees as significant constraints to
private sector development. Some care in interpreting their
responses is necessary, however. The respondents will give answers
that reflect constraints on their bottom line—without regard to the
broader societal or welfare implications. Almost every entrepreneur
will complain that taxes and interest rates on loans are too high. But
that does not necessarily mean that taxes should be lowered or that
interest rates are out of line with risks faced by creditors. Constraints
to the individual respondents need to be weighed against the
broader social goals.
In addition, enterprise surveys only target incumbent enterprises. The surveys do not reach discouraged entrants and so do not
ask about the constraints to entry they could not overcome; nor do
they reach those who recently closed down to ask why they are no
longer in business. Thus the issues that may have an important role
in shaping who is even asked the questions are unlikely to be
identified.

Any survey that asks subjective questions has to address issues
of comparability of responses. Where possible, more objective
questions are preferable. Thus, instead of asking how constraining
the supply of electricity is on a scale of one to five, questions can ask
for the frequency and length of outages, or the costs of running a
generator. These responses can more easily be compared across
respondents and over time.
One further complication in interpreting responses from enterprise surveys and linking them to enterprise outcomes is the potential for a two-way causal relationship between them. It could be that
more onerous conditions are hindering an enterprise’s ability to stay
in business. But a firm’s poor performance, perhaps stemming from
weak management, could also be affecting the degree to which the
respondent complains. Performance also affects which dimensions
of the investment climate matter the most; for example, the availability of skills may be more constraining to expanding firms,
whereas labor regulations may be of greater concern to firms that
are contracting and facing the need to shed workers.

Note: The analysis is based on a city-level enterprise survey of China in 2005 for panel a, and surveys of more than 60,000 urban enterprises in 104 countries in 2006–10 for other
panels. The bars indicate differences in the rating of constraints between firms in two groups. Ratings in the surveys range from 1 (no constraint) to 5 (severe); they are net of the
average rating of constraints by each firm, to assess relative severity. The analysis controls for firm age, size, ownership structure, export orientation, industry, and year.

of industries that rely more on external funding.
The impact of removing constraints also varies across firm size, age, ownership, and other
characteristics.129 For example, infrastructure
bottlenecks tend to stunt the growth of medium
and large businesses but do not affect microenterprises significantly. Similarly, when the judiciary system is viewed as a hindrance, foreign

companies are more likely to withdraw from the
market than private local firms.130

Not all targeting is vulnerable to capture
by interest groups
Capture by vested interests is arguably the most
important concern about targeting. The risk

that the potential beneficiaries could unduly
influence the decision process is a real one. A
too-cozy relationship between businesses and
government can make it extremely difficult to
remove support, even in the event of a blatant
failure. Policy capture by vested interest groups
could undermine the often weak capacity of
governments in many developing countries.
Targeted activities that involve a large number of beneficiaries are less subject to capture.
For example, support for smallholder farming,
competitive cities, or female microentrepreneurs
is less likely to be influenced by beneficiaries.
In every country, thousands, if not millions, of

BOX 6.11 

farmers, urban businesses, and female microentrepreneurs are all bound to benefit from
targeted policies aimed at their group. But individually they do not have the power to influence
such policies, and they may not be able to organize as effective interest groups.
Targeted government interventions are justifiable only if they are based on a solid understanding of what good jobs for development are
in a particular context and only if they can be
designed to be resistant to capture. One example
is the involvement of the private sector in the
design and management of special economic
zones (box 6.11).

Special economic zones have a mixed record

Special economic zones (SEZs) are demarcated geographic areas
within a country’s boundaries where the rules of business are different from those that prevail in the national territory. These differential rules principally deal with investment conditions, international
trade, and customs. The zones have a business environment that is
intended to be more liberal from a policy perspective and more
effective from an administrative perspective.
Before the 1970s, most SEZs were operated by developed countries. Then, starting with East Asia and Latin America, developing
countries began to use SEZs to attract foreign direct investment,
often as a part of export-led growth strategies. The objectives
broadened over time, as SEZs became instruments of trade, investment, industrial, spatial, and even broader economic policies. In
1986, there were 176 zones in 47 countries; by 2006, there were
3,500 of them in 130 countries.
SEZs have a mixed record. Their rates of return are still a topic of
heated debate among economists. Their performance critically
depends on their design and management. SEZs are more likely to
be successful when they are an integral component of the country’s
development strategy, are aligned with the country’s comparative
advantage, are cluster-based, and establish linkages with the rest of
the economy.

For example, in Bangladesh, the SEZ program initially aimed to
attract high-technology investments, but the government shifted
the focus to garments, where the private sector had shown signs of
success. The shift proved to be critical for the performance of the
SEZ program. Building effective partnerships with the private sector
is an important mechanism through which coordination challenges
can be overcome. Institutionally, the partnership can be established
through representation of the private sector on the board of the
SEZ, as in the Dominican Republic and Lesotho.
A common element of many successful SEZs is the technical
competency of the bureaucracy responsible for constructing and
implementing them. While this cautions against targeting when
government capacity is weak, several Latin American countries
have recorded successes by relying on private sector ownership
and management. In the Dominican Republic, where public and
private zones coexist, there are no clear differences in employment,
investment, or exports by zone ownership. But the private zones
generally offer higher-quality infrastructure and more value-added
services than the government-run ones and, accordingly, charge
higher rents.

Connected jobs agendas
The migration of people matches opportunities across borders.
Globalization is leading to a growing international migration of jobs
not only in manufacturing but also, increasingly, in services.

D

ifferent countries face different jobs
challenges, but their jobs agendas are
interconnected by two forces—the migration of people and the migration of jobs.
These two flows have consequences for living
standards, productivity, and social cohesion in
sending and receiving countries. The arrival of
migrants or the outsourcing of jobs abroad affects the living standards of both migrants and
locals. The availability of foreign workers, the
development of migrant networks channeling
savings and ideas, and the arrival of multinational firms bringing more advanced techniques
are all bound to increase productivity. But family structures as well as community life are affected by the movement of people and jobs. The
potential gains are considerable, but there are
also tradeoffs.
Even if development strategies succeed in
addressing jobs challenges at the country level,
mismatches between employment opportunities at home and abroad are bound to occur,
encouraging people to leave their communities
and try their chances elsewhere. Almost inevitably, the international migration of people will
be one of the policy levers to consider in South
Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa, given the projected rapid growth in the labor force in these
regions over the coming decades. Migration
trends will be driven not only by demographic
pressures but also by cultural and geographic
proximity, as well as economic factors.

Jobs agendas are also connected through
the international migration of jobs. The splintering of production tasks has facilitated their
delocalization and outsourcing to developing
countries, resulting in greater trade volumes
and lower prices of final goods. But it has also
led to a global redistribution of jobs in manufacturing, and the same trend is increasingly
visible in services as well. So far, the migration
of jobs out of industrial countries has mainly affected blue-collar workers, but white-collar jobs
are following. These are not once-and-for-all
moves. Growing labor costs in Asia may open
up opportunities for other developing countries
to jump-start industrialization.

Migration of workers
Precise figures on the global number of international migrants are not available, an unsurprising fact given that a number of them cross
borders illegally or do not return once their visas
and permits expire. That is why estimates tend
to rely on population censuses and household
surveys. Even then, differences across countries
in the way that data are gathered, and in the way
legislation defines nationality and migratory
status, make accurate counts difficult.1 The orders of magnitude are relatively uncontroversial,
however. There are more than 200 million migrants worldwide, and 90 million of them are

workers. Migrants represent between 2.5 and 3
percent of the world’s population and the global
labor force.2 Many are temporary or seasonal
workers and return to their home country.

Global patterns of migration
Global figures hide important differences across
countries. Some countries are mainly recipients,
while others are sources, and yet others neither
host nor send significant numbers of migrants

M a p 7.1  

(map 7.1). In a few relatively small recipient
countries, the foreign-born population makes
up more than 40 percent of the total population.
Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, and Singapore are
in this group. Among bigger recipient countries,
those with the largest share of immigrants in
their population are Saudi Arabia (27.8 percent), Canada (21.3 percent), Australia (21.0
percent), and the United States (13.5 percent).
In absolute numbers, the United States is the
largest recipient of migrants, with 42.8 million,

Only in some countries are migrants a substantial share of the population

followed by the Russian Federation (12.3 million), and Germany (10.8 million). Among the
sending countries, those with the largest numbers of migrants are Mexico (10.1 million), India (9.1 million), and Bangladesh (6.0 million).3
Russia is so high on the list, because many ethnic Russians live in countries that were formerly
part of the Soviet Union.
Political turmoil and globalization accelerated migration flows in the first half of the 20th
century. The partition of Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan involved large numbers of people living in countries different from their birthplace.
The decline of transportation costs, the growth
of Persian Gulf economies following surges in
oil prices, and the entry into world markets of
developing countries with large populations
have all stimulated a surge of migrant workers
worldwide.
Differences in expected earnings between the
country of origin and the country of destination
are an important reason for people to migrate.
Earnings gains, however, are offset to varying
degrees by the direct costs of migration (such
as transportation fees and intermediation services) as well as by indirect costs associated with
the difficulties of adapting to a different culture
and society and leaving family and friends behind. These costs also help explain aggregate
migration flows. For many migrants, physical
and cultural proximity (including a common
language, religion, or way of life) are important
when choosing a host country. Concerns about
employment opportunities and personal safety
in the sending countries are other important,
sometimes crucial, drivers of migration. More
than 10 million migrants are refugees, and
nearly 2 million are asylum seekers.4
The growth rate in the global number of migrant workers peaked between 2005 and 2008
and then decelerated because of the impact of the
global economic crisis. During previous decades,
the growth in migration flows came primarily
from South-North flows; that is, from developing to developed countries. South-South migration, although numerically larger, remained
stable over that period.5
Skilled workers represent a growing share of
international migration. Developed countries
increasingly implement policies to attract talent.
Between 1990 and 2000, the share of workers

with at least some tertiary education among immigrants increased from 15 to 25 percent in the
United Kingdom, and from 25 to 30 percent in
the United States. Stark country differences are
also present in skilled labor migration. Some developing countries explicitly promote emigration of skilled workers, while others complain
about “brain drain.” More than 70 percent of
citizens with tertiary education in Haiti, Jamaica,
and Trinidad and Tobago live abroad. The share
of skilled workers among migrants is particularly high in African countries (map 7.2).6
Highly skilled migrants fall into a range
of categories including technology and business creators, scientists, scholars, students, and
health and cultural workers. At 10 percent, their
share of total migration is still relatively small,
but 90 percent of them live in industrial countries.7 In some occupations, the concentration
of skilled migrants is substantial: 27 percent
of all physicians in the United States, 21 percent in Australia, and 20 percent in Canada are
foreign-trained.8

Impacts on sending and receiving
countries
The most direct impact of international migration is on living standards. Through their work
in receiving countries, and through remittances
to sending countries, migrants increase their incomes and those of their families. Migrants also
contribute to global output if their productivity abroad is higher than it was at home, which
may often be the case. They can even contribute
to output in the sending country, as networks
of migrants and returnees serve as channels for
investment, innovation, and expertise. Social effects are mixed, however. On the positive side,
migration connects people from different cultures in ways bound to widen their horizons.
On the negative side, separation from family
and friends can be a source of distress and isolation in the recipient country. Large numbers
of immigrants can also exacerbate frustration
among vulnerable groups in recipient countries,
if foreigners are seen as competitors for jobs and
public services.
The increase in earnings from migration
may amount to tens of thousands of dollars per
worker per year. After controlling for worker

characteristics, the gain may range from 50
percent to more than double the difference in
income per capita between the host and the
sending countries.9,10 Transportation costs and
rents taken by intermediaries can reduce these
gains, however. In some cases, these intermediaries are part of illegal organizations linked to
trafficking of people and criminal abuses, mak-

ing migrants a particularly vulnerable group.
In others, intermediaries are informal agents
who provide market-priced migration services
in the absence of other formal mechanisms to
address the existence of demand and supply
for migration.11 Migrants also face psychological and physical health risks, often without access to health insurance.12 The persistent flows

235

236  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

of migration would indicate, though, that the
large gains, actual and expected, more than
compensate for the costs.
Evidence on the impact of migration on labor outcomes in sending countries is scattered.
If employment opportunities for those who migrate were limited, earnings and employment
would remain unaltered. If they were plentiful,
earnings rise and the participation rates of previously inactive persons would increase. Studies
for Mexico, Pakistan, and the Philippines show
that out-migration did affect wages and unemployment rates in the sending country, but no
discernable effects on labor outcomes have been
found in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka.13
The net effects of migration flows on employment opportunities and labor earnings depend on the skills and the jobs of those who
move abroad. A recent study using data for highand ­middle-income economies shows that immigration of high-skill workers has positive effects on wages of both high- and low-skill local
workers. On the other hand, emigration of more
educated workers is associated with declines in
wages for both low- and high-skill workers who
remain in the country of origin.14
Remittances are an important source of income for households in sending countries, although they do not necessarily reach the poorest
of the poor. In different countries, an increase
in international remittances is associated with
declines in the share of people living in poverty.15 Remittances also increase savings and
investment in recipient families.16 And they are
more resilient than is generally believed. Recent
studies show that despite tougher conditions for
migrants during the 2009 recession, remittances
dipped only slightly.17 Results are mixed on the
impact of remittances on income inequality.
Some studies find that migrants come from the
middle of the income (or wealth) distribution
and that, in the short term, remittances leave
overall inequality unaltered. Others show that in
the medium term inequality decreases, because
of the higher economic activity in localities with
migrants.18 Most studies also report that remittances reduce labor force participation among
migrants’ relatives.19
The growing migration trend among the
highly skilled raises concerns about the implica-

tions for developing countries. Some fear a brain
drain, whereby developing countries would suffer from the loss of valuable human resources. 20
According to this view, developing countries put
considerable fiscal resources into the education
of these workers, with the intention of enhancing their productivity and creating an elite of innovators, thinkers, and administrators. Thus the
migration of skilled workers not only creates a
fiscal and distributive concern in the short term,
but it also impairs the growth capacities of the
country in the long term. In this view, developing countries should create incentives for skilled
workers to return to their home country, for example, through financial reforms of secondary
and tertiary education.
Others, however, see a “brain gain,” whereby
developing countries benefit from networks,
return migration, and the incentives for young
people to improve their skills. Returning migrants bring home entrepreneurial and technical
capacities that enhance productivity in sending
countries. Experience acquired abroad has been
found to induce higher wages among salaried
workers and higher productive efficiency among
entrepreneurs in several countries.21 Beyond the
individual benefits are societal benefits that may
extend to the proliferation of a whole industry
and the creation of new jobs in an entire locality. Bangalore and Hyderabad in India illustrate
this point: returning migrants set up information technology and communication companies
to take advantage of their previous experience
and their links with international companies.22
The presence of highly qualified Indian engineers and executives in U.S. corporations paved
the way for the rise of the Indian software industry.23 The activities of migrant networks are not
restricted to skilled migrants or corporate activities. Networks of Mexican low-skill workers in
the United States have worked with the Mexican
government to redirect and enhance public investment in infrastructure in their communities
of origin.24
Networks of migrants can also be important sources of foreign direct investment and
know-how, both of which promote productivity
growth in sending countries. It is estimated that
Chinese migrants contributed more than half
of all foreign direct investment in China.25 The

	

impact of returning migrants on their communities may be more modest in smaller countries
that lack the scale for the development of new
vibrant businesses.26
The increase in talent migration may also
bring a brain gain through its impact on human
capital accumulation in sending countries. The
prospect of migration raises the returns to education and, thus, fosters investment in human
capital. However, these positive effects depend
on the size of skill migration and the relative size
of the country. Recent evidence indicates that
large countries with low rates of high-skill emigration experience a net gain in human capital.
In contrast, small countries with high rates of
high-skill emigration suffer a net loss.27
Social impacts are more diverse. In sending
countries, researchers find changes in gender
and family relations as well as in political attitudes. But the nature of these changes depends on the country. In some cases, women
and children are empowered by the migration
of spouses and parents; in others, they become
more vulnerable.28 Migrants to societies that
value liberty and democracy come to appreciate
these values, whereas those in more traditional
host countries may become more traditional
themselves.29
In host countries, most studies have concentrated on the influence of migrants on the employment and earnings of locals, as well as on
the fiscal consequences of migrant inflows. The
majority of these studies finds either no effect
or a very small negative effect on the average labor earnings of the locals. But the composition
of employment between locals and migrants
shifts, creating winners and losers.30 The fiscal
consequences for host countries depend on the
characteristics of the migrants. The younger
and more skilled they are, the higher the tax
revenues. The impact of government spending in host countries varies, depending on the
duration of migration and the family composition of the migrants. Computations of the net
effect on the welfare systems of recipient countries are sensitive to hypotheses and estimation
methods.31
Last but not least, migration may also bring
racial prejudice and exacerbate social tensions in
host countries. This happens when migrants are

Connected jobs agendas   

secluded in segregated occupations or neighborhoods, preventing their genuine integration
in society.32 It may also occur when migrants are
perceived as competing for “nonmigrant” jobs.
Prejudice and tensions may result in distrust of
migrants and lead to the hardening of legal requirements for entering the host country, forced
repatriations, and even the building of physical
walls to prevent migration. These policies may
not ease tensions unless a more comprehensive approach is adopted. Irregular or undocumented migration is growing, partly in reaction
to the lack of legal alternatives to migration
given the mounting mismatches between employment opportunities in sending and receiving countries.33

Migration of jobs
Quantifying the international migration of jobs
is even more difficult than estimating the global
number of international migrants. The past four
decades have been marked by the delocalization
and outsourcing of manufacturing tasks from
industrial countries to the developing world,
especially to East Asia. More recently, the same
pattern is observed for tasks in the services sector. In fact, exports of services are the fastestgrowing component of global trade. And the
share originating in developing countries has
been growing steadily over the past two decades.
But counting how many jobs are affected globally is not feasible, because the process involves
job destruction in some countries and job creation in others, in ways that cannot be easily
matched with each other.

Global trends
The share of manufacturing in total employment in industrial countries declined by
roughly one-third between 1970 and 2008, as
did its share in gross domestic product (GDP)
(figure 7.1).34 Although starting from higher
levels, the pattern was the same in Japan as in
Europe and North America. The Republic of
Korea industrialized in the 1970s and 1980s, but
the share of manufacturing in its employment
and GDP started declining in 1992. Meanwhile,

the share of manufacturing in total employment
increased steadily in other East Asian countries,
including China, for four decades. In South Asia
and Sub-Saharan Africa, the share has been low
and stagnant, whereas it has declined in Latin
America and increased in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia. The overall pattern is one where
manufacturing jobs migrated primarily from
Western Europe and the United States to Northeast Asia and then to the rest of East Asia.
The East Asian trends are consistent with the
“flying geese” pattern of development, where
economic transformation is consistent with
dynamic changes in comparative advantage.
Industrialization in East Asian countries began
with the development of labor-intensive sectors,
gradually shifted to capital-intensive sectors, and
then to knowledge-intensive activities. In parallel, wages rose and skills increased.35 First Japan,
then Korea, and more recently China followed a
similar pattern. As labor costs increase further,
light manufacturing jobs are likely to migrate
away from coastal China, where most industries
have concentrated. By some estimates, nearly
100 million jobs are at stake.36
The migration of light manufacturing jobs
out of coastal China could open a once-in-ageneration opportunity for countries in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia to jump-start
their industrialization. But some observers predict that the migration will go mainly to the inland areas in China, where wage rates are lower
than on the coast. This would be consistent
with the patterns of industrialization in Japan;
Korea; Taiwan, China; and the United States,
where the initial geographical concentration of
industries was followed by dispersion within the
same country.37 However, China’s labor market
is relatively integrated to the point where even
unskilled wage rates in rural areas have been increasing rapidly.38 Therefore, an overall decline
in the manufacturing share of GDP in China
might be unavoidable, opening up the opportunity for labor-intensive industrialization in
other developing countries.39
The rapid growth of labor productivity in
manufacturing is resulting in the stagnation or
even the decline of the number of manufacturing jobs worldwide (figure 7.2). Global employment in manufacturing increased by only 30
percent from 1990 to 2008, with most of the expansion taking place in Asia, especially in China.
Given that manufacturing jobs connect to ex-

port markets and global value chains more than
other jobs and are thus more likely to generate
productivity externalities, this stagnation or decline raises the prospect of a fierce international
competition ahead (question 7). If aggregate
numbers of manufacturing jobs are bound to
remain relatively stable, successful industrialization in one region may come at the expense of
industrial employment in another region.
Manufacturing could take off in South Asia
or Sub-Saharan Africa if technology and management knowledge were transferred there. Such
a transfer, however, is not simple: fostering entrepreneurship, nurturing a more skilled workforce, creating a stronger investment climate,
and establishing a more favorable institutional
environment would be necessary. There is also
a risk of focusing on industries that are not in
line with the potential comparative advantage
of these regions.40 Combined with poor logistics
and weak government capacity, that could mean
that few manufacturing jobs would actually migrate to these regions. Studies on the locational
decisions of multinational corporations show
that many factors come into play (box 7.1).
Services were once regarded largely as nontradable, but this is no longer the case. Both
­country-specific and global trends show a grow-

ing share of employment and GDP in services,
some of which are sold across borders.41 New
ways of delivering services, often broken down
into small tasks and driven by information and
communication technology (ICT), are transforming where service activities can be located
(box 7.2). The world share of developing countries in global exports of services increased from
11 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 2008. Services are now the main contributor to economic
growth in many developing countries, including
India.42
The rapid expansion of trade in services is
bound to increase productivity on a global scale.
But it also is raising fears in developed countries
that service sector jobs will migrate to developing countries through offshoring or international outsourcing, much the same as manufacturing jobs did over the past four decades.
A telltale sign of the potential for offshoring and outsourcing is the substantial number
of service sector tasks already being performed
remotely within industrial countries.43 In the
United States, service occupations that are tradable by nature, such as computer systems design
and management consulting, display a heavy
geographic concentration. This concentration
results partly from agglomeration economies,

BOX 7.1 

Why do multinationals locate where they do?

Where multinationals locate provides insights into the critical characteristics in a host country that firms want or need. Traditionally,
foreign direct investment (FDI) was categorized either as horizontal—multinationals seeking better access to larger markets overseas—or vertical—multinationals moving part of their production
to a lower-cost location. As trade barriers and transportation costs
have fallen and supply chains involve ever more specialized tasks,
the importance of locating near the final market has diminished. But
the empirical patterns show that “costs” need to be determined
over a range of dimensions.
The location-decision question has been examined empirically
by looking at how the characteristics of host countries predict the
inflow of FDI and entry of multinationals. Significant macroeconomic instability or conflict disqualifies most locations. Low wages
can be attractive, but given that labor is often a small share of overall manufacturing costs, they are often not the predominant consideration. And labor costs cannot be evaluated separately from the
quality of skills; developed countries remain significant destinations
of FDI in part because of their highly skilled workforces. Access to
land, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia where land access is
more regulated, can be a significant consideration. Poor or inconsistent public services, including electricity, security, and transportation infrastructure, can quickly raise costs—through delays, lost
production, and the expense of privately providing these services.

Costs associated with complying with business regulations and with
taxes can also be important, as are the reliability and cost of contract
enforcement institutions. The literature shows that the relative
importance of these dimensions often varies by different types of
sectors, the degree of capital intensity, and technological sophistication. The presence of other firms is also a consideration. Quick and
reliable access to suppliers can reduce costs and delays.
In addition to the academic literature, a number of consulting
firms provide analysis and rankings of the attractiveness of countries based on the views of top executives of multinationals. A.T.
Kearney has published a Foreign Direct Investment Index since
1998. Three dimensions emerge as critical in its analysis: well-­
functioning financial markets, a strong business environment, and
strong labor skills. A separate index for the location of services also
emphasizes skills, particularly language skills, and the degree of
global integration. Labor typically accounts for a larger share of
overall costs in services than in manufacturing.
The evolution of supply chains into more specialized tasks operating across more diverse locations can offer opportunities for an
increasing number of developing countries. Multinationals are not
looking for a strong business environment across the board; they
care about inputs and services that are specific to their needs and
thus are location-specific.

E-links create job opportunities in developing countries, but the scale is still modest

Internet services are becoming ever more accessible, including in
the developing world. Crowd­
sourcing tools help businesses to
break up larger tasks into many smaller discrete steps. These are
then offered to a global online community through competition.
The platform TopCoder, for example, brings together close to
400,000 programmers globally.
A special type of online outsourcing, branded impact sourcing
by some, aims to bring employment and supplementary income to
low-income areas. Impact sourcing is estimated to represent 4 percent of the entire business process outsourcing industry, accounting for US$4.5 billion in total revenues and employing around
140,000 people around the globe. Sama­source is a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, working with major technology clients. It splits large projects into “micro work”—small tasks that can
be done online using inexpensive computers—and distributes the
tasks largely to women working with partner service providers in
the poorest parts of the world, including remote villages, slums, and

refugee camps in countries, such as Haiti, Pakistan, Uganda, and
others. Data workers develop skills in ­English, computers, and a variety of project-specific tasks. Samasource has reached 1,600 women
and youth over the past three years.
Similarly, RuralShores aims to bring rural India into the global
knowledge world. It provides remote processing of noncritical business transactions such as data entry, simple bookkeeping, expenses
handling, and document digitalization and archiving. RuralShores
runs 10 centers in 7 Indian states, employing about 1,000 people.
The centers, run as for-profit entities, are all located in remote Indian
villages. While most employees are high-school graduates, the company gives preference to people with disabilities and young jobseekers from poor, agrarian families. Impact sourcing does face
challenges that include access to clients and contracts, sustainable
demand, robust infrastructure, effective recruitment, and identification of investors.

supporting specialization. But simple geographic imbalances between the local supply
and demand for services also contribute to remote provision.
Trade in services can be expected to expand
rapidly in the coming years. Until recently, it was
thought that only labor-intensive tasks would
be relocated to developing countries, allowing
production in industrial countries to focus on
capital- or skill-intensive tasks.44 However, developing countries are now exporting not only
traditional services, such as transportation and
tourism, but also modern and skill-intensive
services, such as financial intermediation, computer and information services, and legal and
technical support.45 Skilled jobs performed by
accountants, programmers, designers, architects, medical diagnosticians, and financial and
statistical analysts are increasingly outsourced
by firms in industrial countries.46 In India, the
number of such skilled white-collar jobs has
grown rapidly.47 However, some of the service
jobs seen as skilled in developing countries are
considered unskilled in industrial countries.48
India was a developing world pioneer in
building a modern export-oriented services sector, but other countries—Brazil, Chile, China,
and Malaysia, to name a few—have also seized
the opportunity.49 But outsourcing does not
only happen between industrial and developing countries. In the United States (the largest
offshoring economy), 85 percent of the service
trade is with other industrial countries.50 Twothirds of service sector exports from developing
countries are actually South-South trade.51
Developing countries tend to specialize in
certain activities within the services sector. For
example, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Uruguay are
strong in professional and ICT-related services;
Chile in distribution and transportation services; Mexico in communication and distribution services; and Sub-Saharan African countries in professional services.52 This diversity in
specialization will likely lead to both competition and cooperation, involving different segments of the services sector, rather than a headon collision between industrial and developing
countries.
This new phase of globalization is bound to
influence views and interpretations about structural transformation and the migration of jobs.

Connected jobs agendas   

Some researchers claim that a “revolution” is
under way that is turning services sectors into
the main engine of economic growth in developing countries.53 Others argue that developing
countries such as India and the Philippines are
successful in exporting relatively skill-intensive
services not because of their comparative advantage in such services but because of policies
preventing their manufacturing sectors from
taking off.54 Given the stagnation of global employment in manufacturing and the growing
trade in services, a relevant question is whether
developing countries can successfully skip the
industrialization phase of development.

Winners and losers
The obvious winners of globalization are the
workers and entrepreneurs in countries to
which industries and splintered tasks have migrated. Outsourcing and offshoring, along with
the attendant transfer of new technologies and
advanced management methods, contributes
to productivity growth and improvements in
living standards. The development of more efficient industries and services encourage a reallocation of labor toward more productive uses.
It also stimulates the subsequent development
of other interrelated industries and sectors
through backward and forward linkages. The
development of a modern services sector can
lead to greater coordination in value chains and
make a further subdivision of tasks and the reorganization of production possible, leading to
economies of scale.55 Multiple actors—including multinationals, civil society organizations
and consumers in industrial countries—are
increasingly active in efforts to improve working conditions and workers’ rights in developing
countries. To the extent that such efforts bear
fruit, enhanced export opportunities improve
workers’ well-being.56 In all these ways, significant trickle-down effects can have widespread
benefits for recipient countries.
The hidden winners from the migration of
jobs are consumers at large. The improved international division of labor expands the global
availability of goods and services, improving
living standards around the world.57 This point
can be easily understood by thinking how the
world would look if China and India could not

241

242  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

provide cheap goods and services to the rest of
the world.
The obvious losers are those who have lost
their jobs because of the declining competitiveness of the industries and services where
they used to work. While skilled workers may
easily find similar occupations in other industries without a loss in salary, many low-skilled
workers are not so fortunate. Low-skilled
workers or those with industry- or occupationspecific skills that are no longer in demand are
more likely to be forced to accept lower-paying
jobs in different industries or remain unemployed.58 Job losses could become a serious issue not only in industrial countries but also
in dynamically growing developing countries,
such as China, as their labor costs increase.
There are also hidden losers. These are the
workers and entrepreneurs in countries which
have failed to develop new industries and services connected to world markets and the jobs
that go with them.59 Workers in those countries,
however, may not perceive the lost employment
opportunities.60
One way to mitigate the welfare losses from
globalization, both apparent and hidden, is
through the international migration of workers. Income differentials across countries,
which reflect differences in the growth rates of
different economies, are important drivers of
this migration. By reallocating workers from
stagnant or slowly growing economies to rapidly growing ones, the international migration
of workers contributes to the reduction in the

income gap created by the international migration of jobs. But jobs tend to migrate more easily than people.

* * *
The migration of people and the migration of
jobs make clear that jobs challenges, despite being
country specific, can also be global in scope. Both
sending and recipient countries can benefit from
these international movements in a variety of
ways, from higher labor earnings to remittances,
from greater productivity to broader networks.
Consumers worldwide also benefit from less expensive consumer goods. Tensions and costs are
associated with these two migrations, however.
Migrant workers may suffer discrimination and
segregation or lose their family and cultural connections and identity, disrupting not only their
own sense of well-being but also have an impact
on communities in origin and host countries.
The migration of people and the migration
of jobs may transform entire communities, creating winners and losers. Many see their lives
improve, but those who lose their jobs to outsourcing and offshoring may experience permanent declines in well-being, especially if they are
unskilled. These spillovers, positive and negative, are powerful motivators for the political
and social groups that promote or oppose the
migration of people and of jobs. But these spillovers are international in nature, so coping with
them only through national policy instruments
may prove unsatisfactory.

Competing for jobs?

Many developing countries face a jobs agenda.
In some, it involves offering avenues to rural
populations to move out of poverty. In others,
it aims at leveraging the gains from urbanization and from integration in global markets. Yet
in others, the goal is to prevent youth from becoming disenfranchised or to reduce the risk of
conflict. These agendas are addressed through
national policies that stimulate job creation by
the private sector, especially in the areas and
activities where development payoffs are highest. But jobs agendas of individual countries are
connected through globalization: trade in goods
and services, investment flows, and migration of
workers. This begs the question: if jobs can migrate from one country to another, do policies
to support job creation in one country become
policies affecting jobs in other countries—policies competing for jobs globally?
Among economists, the conventional wisdom is that the number of jobs is not determined by international trade and investment
but by the total number of people in the labor
force. And in general, openness to international
trade and foreign direct investment is beneficial
for all the countries involved. Thus, globalization is not a zero-sum game. From this point
of view, policies to support job creation are not
policies competing for jobs, even as they may
alter the global flows of trade, investment, and
workers.
The general public seems to have a less sanguine view of the situation. Representative public opinion polls show that firm relocation and
tasks outsourced abroad are seen as a threat to
employment in industrial countries (box 7.3).
Globalization is perceived as a head-to-head
competition in which employment gains in one
country can be achieved only at the expense of
jobs in other countries.
There is merit to both views. Past the shortterm impact of outsourcing and delocalization,
the total number of jobs in one country should
not be substantially affected by policy decisions
in other countries. Some firms may close or start
activities, others may expand or contract their
business, but total employment will be roughly

determined by the size of the labor force. However, the composition of employment is bound
to change. The concern is that the share of
good jobs for development may decline in one
country and increase in another. Whether that
happens depends on the nature of good jobs
for development and the types of national
policies being adopted to support job creation.
While the public’s concern is legitimate, not all
measures to support job creation amount to a
­beggar-thy-neighbor policy.

Not a competition for total employment
but for its composition
International trade and investment can be expected to lead to greater prosperity. Globalization, including firm relocation and outsourcing,
may result in job losses at home in the short
term, but the demand for labor should increase
in the longer run, as specialization generates efficiency gains in both industrial and developing
countries.61 Lower prices for goods and services,
and a growing consumption demand from
emerging countries as they prosper, can only reinforce the upward trend in the global demand
for labor.
Empirical evidence to a large extent confirms this upbeat assessment. Labor earnings
and working conditions improve as countries
grow richer, and global integration has been
good for growth. Across developing countries,
a 1 percent increase in a country’s openness,
measured as the share of its foreign trade in its
output, has been associated with a 1 percent increase in GDP per capita.62 Gains may reach up
to 1.5 percentage points on average in the case of
openness in financial services and telecommunications.63 Even in Sub-Saharan Africa, where
trade liberalization was viewed with skepticism,
the increase in output growth rates could be in
the range of 0.5 to 0.8 percent.64 Evidence also
shows that firms engaged in global markets pay
higher wages. This is true of exporting firms
from Colombia to Morocco and from Mexico
to Korea. It is also true of foreign-owned companies, whether they operate in Cameroon or

BOX 7.3 

Globalization is often viewed as jobs migrating abroad

Across European countries, popular perceptions can be inferred
from the Eurobarometer surveys. One of its questions is the following: “What comes first to mind when you hear the word ‘globalization’?” The options for answering this question are opportunities for
domestic companies in terms of new outlets; foreign investments
in the country; relocation of some companies to countries where
labor is cheaper; increased competition for the country; and other.
The third option reflects perceived job insecurity. Even before the

global crisis and the European debt crisis, when concerns about unemployment were not exacerbated, about one-third to one-half of
respondents see globalization as a relocation of companies abroad.
The survey also asked: “Which of the following two propositions is the
one which is closest to your opinion with regard to globalization?”
Possible answers included good opportunity for domestic companies;
threat to employment and companies; and “do not know.” With the
exception of Denmark, where only a small minority chose the second

option, between one-third and three-quarters of the respondents saw
globalization as a threat to jobs.
Based on opinion polls, policies for jobs are often perceived as a
zero-sum game in which gains for one country can be achieved only at
the expense of others. The chairman and CEO (Chief Executive Officer)
of Gallup put it as follows: “If you were to ask me, from all the world
polling Gallup has done for more than 75 years, what would fix the

world—what would suddenly create worldwide peace, global wellbeing, and the next extraordinary advancements in human development, I would say the immediate appearance of 1.8 billion jobs—formal jobs.” In his view, “this raises an important distinction—not only do
we need to create more jobs, we need to increase the number of good
jobs. And we can’t see that quest for good jobs as an internal skirmish
between warring political ideologies. It’s an international war.”a

Admittedly, the dispersion of earnings
within countries has also increased, for instance
in the form of higher returns to education, and
it is tempting to attribute this trend to globalization. Low-skill jobs in industrial countries
are often high-skill jobs from the perspective of
developing countries, and exporting itself is a
skill-intensive activity. Therefore, international
trade and offshore outsourcing can be expected
to increase the relative demand for skills at both
ends, favoring better-off workers. The empirical results on this possible effect vary widely,
however.66 For sure, all policies create winners
and losers, and the distribution of labor earnings has widened in parallel with globalization,
but a causal relationship is difficult to establish.
Overall, widening disparities may have more to
do with technological progress and financial liberalization than with globalization.
A different perspective arises when considering the composition of employment, rather
than the level or dispersion of labor earnings.
Globalization provides developing countries
with the opportunity to connect to world markets and derive productivity spillovers boosting
their economic growth. Manufacturing jobs integrated in global value chains, as well as jobs
in technologically advanced services and in finance, are often seen as tickets to rapid development. However, rapid technological progress
and economies of scale may mean the global
number of some of these jobs will not increase
much. For jobs in manufacturing, the experience of the last few decades has shown a relative
stability of their global numbers together with a
dramatic change in their spatial distribution. If
so, policies for job creation could lead to a competition not for the level of employment but for
the jobs with the highest development payoffs.
The experience of Japan and the United
States illustrates the point. In the 1950s, Japan
exported cheap labor-intensive products in
exchange for goods embedded with more advanced knowledge and technology. This strategy generated much needed revenue for Japan’s
post–World War II recovery. More importantly,
it contributed to Japan’s productivity growth
and built the foundation for the production

of more sophisticated goods. In the 1970s and
1980s, Japan not only began exporting steel,
semiconductors, and automobiles but turned
into a leading supplier. As the major exporter of
these products, the United States suffered from
Japan’s expansion.67 The United States had been
characterized by its fluid labor markets. Yet, the
potential welfare loss from the decline of Pittsburgh, Detroit, and other industrial centers
could be substantial, even if labor was reallocated smoothly.68 This competition was resolved
by “voluntary export restraints”—a special form
of quota that actually granted all quota rents to
Japan but prevented a complete decline of such
employment in the United States, indicating the
importance attributed to these industries.69
Concerns are similar for developing countries
nowadays. Consider the opportunities opened by
the increase in labor earnings in the coastal areas
of China.70 Some labor-intensive manufacturing jobs connected with global value chains will
migrate out of China in search of lower production costs. Given rapid technological progress,
the global number of jobs in light manufacturing is unlikely to increase much. Low-income
countries in both Sub-Saharan Africa and South
Asia aspire to attract some of those jobs, so a
competition is involved. Tension is not limited
to labor-intensive manufacturing jobs. A similar logic underlies government efforts to attract
high-tech companies, as Costa Rica successfully
did with Intel.71 This is also the logic behind
government efforts to foster services exports,
exemplified by the success of Brazil, Chile, India,
Malaysia, and the Philippines.72
Because technological progress and globalization connect markets to an unprecedented
level, they also result in competition over other
types of jobs with high development payoffs.
Jobs located in a global hub can generate large
productivity spillovers. London stands as one
of the most economically vibrant cities in Europe largely because it serves as an international
financial center. The financial industry entails
scale economies and is supported by density.
Therefore, the number of global financial centers is limited, and their formation is shaped by
location, history, and national policies. Similar
logic applies to international transportation
hubs such as Singapore, clusters of information

and computer technology–related industries
such as Silicon Valley and Bangalore, and so on.

Policies for jobs: Different degrees of
competition
Even if globalization may result in a competition
for good jobs for development, not all efforts
to support job creation amount to beggar-thyneighbor policies. Whether they do so depends
on the type of instruments used and the nature
of the spillovers from jobs.73
Because globalization involves international
trade and foreign direct investment, it is natural
to first consider trade- and investment-related
instruments. Some of them, such as import tariffs, export subsidies, and local content requirements, are ruled out by multilateral trade agreements; others, such as improving access to credit
for private exporters and identifying and removing specific constraints faced by foreign investors, are not. But in reality these are just a narrow subset of policies for jobs. When bidding to
attract foreign direct investment, governments
can compete directly through tax holidays or
through dedicated physical infrastructure and
human resources. They can also compete indirectly, as when they take actions that appeal to
both local entrepreneurs and foreign investors.
For example, they can contain increases in the
cost of labor by keeping mandated benefits affordable. Or they can improve the availability
and quality of factors of production, such as
worker skills and public infrastructure. In South
Asia, for example, the quality of physical infrastructure and the education of the workforce are
the strongest predictors of entry of new firms.74
When considering good jobs for development
more generally, and not just jobs connected to
world markets, the set of policy options is even
broader. Urban policies are another important
instrument to stimulate job creation by the private sector. Given the potential agglomeration
of economies, relatively small interventions can
have large effects.75 In low-income countries,
enhancing extension services may have a large
impact on farm productivity and, thus, on poverty reduction. Whether this broader set of policies leads to a competition for jobs depends on
whether policies in one country have a positive

or an adverse effect on the social welfare of another country.
A key question to ask is what purpose policies serve (figure 7.3). For instance, policies
for jobs may aim to improve compliance with
rights, prosecuting forced labor and harmful
forms of child labor. Because fundamental labor rights and principles have been endorsed
by most countries, promoting compliance with
rights amounts to providing a global public
good. Thus, interventions against human trafficking or child prostitution in one country are
unlikely to have adverse effects in other countries and do not lead to a competition for jobs.
In the absence of a global public good dimension, the second question is what market
imperfection or institutional failure is being
addressed by the policy intervention. Tackling
the institutional failures that lead to conflict,
discrimination, or lack of voice might have an
effect on the international flows of goods, services, and finance, but only indirectly. The risk
that government interventions in these areas
will result in a competition for jobs with other
countries is limited. The risk is also limited in
the case of interventions aimed at providing
jobs opportunities for the poor. In all of these
cases, there should be gains in well-being in the
developing country, and no substantial loss in
well-being in other countries. Therefore, jobs
policies focused on strengthening social cohesion and improving living standards should be
acceptable as well.
The answer is less clear when government interventions aim at enhancing productivity spillovers from jobs. These interventions typically
include urban development policies, investments in infrastructure and skills, or the promotion of entrepreneurship. Because these interventions are likely to affect the international
flows of goods, services, and finance, the range
of possible outcomes is broader. While no general rule is available, interventions that undermine an open trading system most likely reduce
aggregate well-being—probably more at home
than abroad. On the other hand, interventions
aligned with a country’s dynamic comparative
advantage could result in mutual gains. Admittedly, assessing what “aligned” means in practice
is bound to involve an element of judgment.76

But the East Asian experience, with jobs in manufacturing migrating from Japan to Korea and
Taiwan, China, and subsequently to China, and
then to Vietnam, provides some hints. As these

countries followed their dynamic comparative advantage under the “flying geese” pattern
of development, there were few instances of an
open competition for jobs between them.

and different methodologies have been proposed.
From a theoretical point of view, the net effect in
a given country is ambiguous because offshoring may reduce employment in the short term,
but the resulting specialization can induce productivity gains that increase employment in the
long term, although with a change in the share of
different types of labor and occupations within
the total. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD 2007) and
the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD 2004) indicate that
offshoring is not necessarily a zero-sum game
and that short-term job losses may be more than
compensated for by job gains, although with
variations across industries and sectors.

PART

3

Policies through
the jobs lens

Introduction to Part 3

M

ost jobs are created by the private sector. While public works and targeted
employment programs are justified
in certain situations, the primary role of government is not to directly provide employment. It is
to set the conditions for job creation by the private sector, and especially to remove the obstacles to the creation of more of the jobs with the
highest development payoffs, given the circumstances of the country.
When faced with jobs challenges, policy
makers tend to look first at labor policies as either the solution or the problem. It is important,
then, to understand the role and the impacts of
policies and institutions like labor market regulation, collective bargaining, active labor market
programs, and social insurance. But the main
constraints to the job creation often lie outside
the labor market, and a clear approach is needed
to support appropriate policy responses.

•	

•	

Fundamentals are necessary for growth and
are a precondition for strong job creation by
the private sector. Macroeconomic sta­bility,
an enabling business environment, human
capital, and the rule of law, including the
progressive realization of rights, are the key
policy fundamentals.
Labor policies need to be adequate for growth
to translate into jobs. Policies should seek
to avoid the distortive interventions that
stifle labor reallocation and undermine the
creation of jobs in functional cities and
global value chains. But policies should also

ensure voice and social protection, especially
for the most vulnerable.

•	

Policy priorities have to be established in support of good jobs for development. Ideally,
policies should aim at removing the market
imperfections and institutional failures preventing the private sector from creating more
of those jobs. If the constraints cannot be
easily singled out or are difficult to remove,
offsetting policies may be considered.

Chapter

Labor policies revisited
Labor policies can address labor market imperfections. But interventions
can hinder dynamism in some cases, while the lack of mechanisms for
voice and social protection affects the most vulnerable.

L

abor markets have imperfections in the
form of inadequate information, uneven
bargaining power, limited ability to enforce long-term commitments, and insufficient
insurance mechanisms against employmentrelated risks. Imperfections like these create gaps
between the individual and the social value of
jobs. They can thus result in a level and composition of employment that are not optimal from
a social point of view.
Labor policies and institutions—regulations,
collective representation, active labor market
­programs, and unemployment insurance—can
in principle be used to address these imperfections. Other policies, such as pensions and other
forms of social insurance, address imperfections
elsewhere in the economy but can have important implications for the functioning of the labor
market.
Labor policies and institutions are bundled
in different ways in different countries (figure 8.1).1 Their configuration tends to vary by
level of development, with policies and institutions generally more developed in industrial
countries. This is especially so for institutions
providing a vehicle for collective voice, such as
bargaining between employers and employees,
and for social insurance. But the nature of the
labor policies and institutions in any country is
affected by more than just the level of development and must be seen in the context of the

country’s legal traditions, politics, and social
norms and values.
The impact of labor policies is often the subject of heated debates. In the past decade, improved data and methods have generated a great
deal of new information not only in industrial
countries but increasingly in developing countries as well. The analyses of these data have led
to fresh insights. Estimated effects prove to be
relatively modest in most cases—certainly more
modest than the intensity of the debate would
suggest. Excessive or insufficient interventions
can certainly have detrimental effects on productivity. But in between these extremes lies a
“plateau” where effects enhancing and undermining efficiency can be found side by side and
most of the impact is redistributive. Overall,
labor policies and institutions are neither the
major obstacle nor the magic bullet for creating
good jobs for development in most countries.

divided by the labor force. Social insurance indicates workers contributing toward old-age pensions as a percentage of the labor force. Countries were classified in the eight groups
by the World Development Report 2013 team. One country can belong to several groups. The figure shows unweighted averages across countries.

Labor regulations:
A “plateau” effect
Labor regulations can be designed to address
labor market failures that result in inefficient
or inequitable outcomes. Difficulties in enforcing long-term contracts between employers
and employees may lead to excessive churning
and underinvestment in training. Inefficiencies
in the organization of insurance schemes may
leave workers unprotected in the case of dismissal, which could force them to curtail their
job search before finding the right match. Uneven market power can enable firms to set wages
that are lower than would be agreed upon under more competitive conditions. Discriminatory practices can have the same effect. Uneven
power or incomplete information may lead to
an unsafe workplace. These market imperfections and institutional failures can affect job
creation and lead to gaps between what workers
gain from employment and the social value of
their jobs.

Employment protection legislation and
minimum wages
Employment protection legislation (EPL) and
minimum wages have been widely adopted to
address some of these failures. EPL consists of
rules governing hiring and termination and de-

BOX 8.1 

fining the degree to which job security is guaranteed (box 8.1). Virtually all countries regulate
hiring and termination in some way—severance
payments, for example, are mandated by law or
through collective agreements in 170 countries.2
Similarly, more than 100 countries have ratified International Labour Organization (ILO)
conventions regarding minimum wages, and
many others have established minimum wages
even though they have not ratified these conventions.3 However, the specific nature of labor
regulations reflects the society for which they
are written. Important determinants include a
country’s legal tradition, as well as civic attitudes
toward solidarity, inequality, and trust.4 The
content, as well as the impact of regulations, is
also influenced by interactions with other potentially complementary institutions such as
collective representation and social insurance.
Views on labor regulations can be polarized,
with contrasting implications for policy making. Fundamental questions, such as whether
labor policies should protect jobs or workers,
often spark heated debates (question 8).
For some, these regulations provide necessary guarantees for workers against economic
volatility and the strong bargaining power of
firms.5 EPL can offer job security, deterring precarious forms of employment. Minimum wages
can prevent extreme poverty among workers
and address the inefficiencies that stem from

Employment protection legislation covers more than firing rules

Employment protection legislation, or EPL, can be classified into
two main groups of rules, one pertaining to hiring, the other to
­termination. Rules on hiring dictate what types of labor contracts
are permissible under what conditions—for instance, open-ended,
fixed-term, part-time, and apprenticeship contracts. Rules on termination govern the ending of contracts including causes (voluntary and involuntary, justified or unfair), end-of-service compen­
sation (severance pay), and procedures (for instance, third-party
notification or approval, advance notice, and vesting periods). The
mix and stringency of these rules result in a continuum of regulation across countries, which has been subject to different measurement efforts. a

Other types of labor policies can also have implications for job
security. Some regulations set specific conditions for the employment of women and young workers. They include maternity leave,
the need for child care facilities, first-contract waivers, or reduced
minimum wage for apprentices. The aim of these policies is to facilitate the p
­ articipation of more vulnerable population groups and to
protect them once they are employed. Antidiscrimination regulations address socially unaccepted ­differences in the treatment of
workers, with the goal to reduce inequality and enhance social
cohesion and fairness in employment.

noncompetitive labor markets.6 By establishing a reference wage, minimum wages can even
benefit uncovered workers through the so-called
lighthouse effect.7 EPL and minimum wages are
also seen as creating the conditions for human
capital accumulation and associated productivity gains.8
Critics of strong EPL and minimum wages
hold that they tend to reduce employment,
hinder productivity growth, and can lead to
divisions in society between those who benefit
from the regulations and those who do not. According to this view, to the extent that EPL and
minimum wages raise labor costs, they can increase poverty by pushing low-skilled workers,
young people, and women into unemployment
or into informal sector jobs.9 Hiring and termination restrictions can slow down labor reallocation and hence constrain productivity growth.
Finally, because they are often perceived as part
of the social contract, labor market regulations
can be difficult to reform, when circumstances
change, generating discord and even conflict.10

Modest impacts overall . . .
New data and more rigorous methodologies
have spurred a wave of empirical studies over
the past two decades on the effects of labor regulation.11 These studies examine the influence
of EPL and minimum wages on employment,
wages, the distribution of wages, and to a lesser
extent, productivity. Few have looked at wider
impacts on social cohesion.
Based on this wave of new research, the
overall impact of EPL and minimum wages is
smaller than the intensity of the debate would
suggest (tables 8.1 and 8.2).12 Most estimates
of the impacts on employment levels tend to
be insignificant or modest.13 Studies of EPL in
Latin America and the Caribbean, for example,
report mixed results: negative employment effects of job security rules have been found in
Argentina, Colombia, and Peru, while no significant effect was evident in Brazil and some
Caribbean countries. Different studies for Chile
have reached both results.14 Overall, the ma-

jority of minimum wage studies do find negative employment effects, especially on young
workers. But magnitudes tend to be small and
a number of studies report no effect, or in some
cases, even positive effects.15 EPL and minimum
wages can shift employment away from young
people, women, and the less-skilled and toward
prime-age men and the better educated.16 Their
effects can vary within a country. In Indonesia,
increasing minimum wages during the 1990s
had a negative effect on employment among
small firms but not on large firms.17 Across
countries, both EPL and minimum wages are
associated with a reduction in wage inequality.18
EPL has clear dynamic effects, reducing labor
market flows and increasing durations in both
employment and unemployment.19 In this way,
strong job security rules slow down labor reallocation and limit the efficiency gains from creative destruction. Studies on the overall impact
of EPL on productivity are mixed, however, with
some finding negative productivity impacts and
others finding positive or no significant effects.20
This mix of findings may be caused by other influences of job security rules, such as incentives
to invest in training, which can counteract the
lower rates of labor reallocation. Some countries have tried to reduce EPL by implementing
partial (“dual-track”) reforms that increase the
scope for nonpermanent employment. However, unless accompanied by ­reductions in the
protection of permanent jobs, this approach
seems to result in the more vulnerable groups
ending up in more precarious employment.21

In many developing countries with large
informal sectors, the generally modest impacts
of EPL and minimum wages may stem in part
from poor coverage and weak enforcement. In
Brazil, employment effects of strong job security provisions were negative in municipalities
where enforcement was strong.22 Mechanisms
for voice and representation and the capacity
of government to effectively administer regulations influence the effectiveness of enforcement. Certainly, poor rules coupled with weak
enforcement are not a desirable combination to
address labor market imperfections.
But many countries appear to set EPL and
minimum wages in a range where impacts on
employment or productivity are modest. Within
that range, or “plateau,” effects enhancing and
undermining efficiency can be found side by
side, and most of the impact is redistributive.
The distributional effects tend to be equalizing
among those who are covered by these regulations, but divisions can be accentuated between
those covered and those who are not. With efficiency effects relatively modest on the plateau,
countries can choose where they want to be
depending on their normative preferences for
redistribution.

. . . but cliffs at the edge of the plateau
However, when the edge of the plateau is
reached (either on the too-strict or too-loose
side), impacts are more negative. Some studies
have found that Indian states with more restric-

	

tive EPL have significantly lower employment
and output, and this effect is strongest where
dispute resolution is ineffective or costly.23 Large
increases in the minimum wage in Colombia
in the late 1990s led to significant employment
losses, exacerbated by weak labor demand at the
time.24 At this edge of the plateau, which can
vary according to the country situation, labor
regulations can slow down job creation in cities,
or in global value chains, and can cause countries to miss out on jobs supporting agglomeration effects and knowledge spillovers. Forgoing
the development payoffs from urbanization and
global integration would be one way to fall off
the cliff.
It does not follow that minimal regulation is
the answer. If rules are too weak, or not enforced,
the problems of poor information, unequal bargaining power, or inadequate risk management
remain unaddressed. This cliff may be less visible than excessive labor market rigidity, but it
is no less real.
The main challenge is to set EPL and minimum wages so that they address the imperfections in the labor market without falling off the
plateau. The edges of the plateau vary across
countries and even within countries over time,
as conditions change. In Brazil, for example,
minimum wages had negative impacts on employment in the 1990s but not over the past
decade, even though they were increasing relative to average wages.25 It is important, then, to
monitor impacts closely and reflect on the design and implementation of regulations and
their interaction with other institutions.26 Although EPL and minimum wages may not address labor market imperfections effectively, in
most countries good jobs for development are
lacking for other reasons.

Collective representation:
New forms of voice
Collective bargaining and other forms of “voice”
can address information failures at the workplace in ways that enhance productivity as well
as employment security and earnings. For instance, workers may have knowledge about the
details of production and operations that those
making decisions do not have. Employers are
likely to be informed about certain aspects of

Labor policies revisited   

the business that would be relevant and useful
for workers. Information sharing can generate additional efficiency gains by providing a
mechanism for resolving conflicts and reducing
wasteful turnover.
Collective representation and bargaining can
also address problems of uneven market power
whereby firms may be able to impose lower
wages or inferior working conditions on individual workers than would be the case under
competitive conditions.

Bargaining between firms and workers
The coverage of unions and collective bargaining varies considerably around the world (figure 8.2). Coverage rates are generally low in
developing countries, where few workers out of
the civil service or protected sectors belong to
a trade union. In most countries where regular
data are available, the coverage of collective bargaining agreements has declined during the past
two decades.27 The shift of employment toward
the services sector, globalization, technological
progress, evolving social values, and legislative
changes have all been advanced as causes of this
decline.28
The vast majority of the evidence confirms
the existence of a wage premium in favor of
union members and other workers covered by
collective agreements. Estimates of the adjusted
union wage effect (controlling for other factors)
range from around 5 percent in Japan and the
Republic of Korea, up to 15 percent in countries
as varied as Brazil, Canada, Germany, Malaysia,
Mexico, and the United States.29 South Africa
stands at the upper end, although there is controversy on how high the union wage effect actually is (box 8.2). Wage effects tend to be strongest for women and in countries where union
membership is high. It is also clear that unions
and collective bargaining have an equalizing effect on earnings distributions by compressing
wage differentials. Research has shown that wage
inequality falls during periods when union density is increasing and rises when union membership is in decline.30 Little evidence exists on the
impact of unions on poverty.
One relevant question is whether union wage
gains come at the expense of reduced employment. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed
this question in developing countries. In in-

dustrial countries, studies are divided between
those finding that unions reduce employment
(or increase unemployment) and those finding
no significant effect. Where negative impacts are
found, the magnitude is modest. The most recent estimates by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) find
that a 10 percentage point decline in union coverage is associated with an increase in employment of 0.8 percentage points.31

Industrial relations and productivity
The impact of collective bargaining on productivity reflects the balance of two opposing
forces. On the one hand, voice may lead to better information sharing, while higher labor costs
under unionization may encourage management to invest more on training and technology, leading to higher productivity. On the other
hand, unions may also be able to negotiate restrictions in hours worked and pay rules that
reduce effort, hindering productivity. The net
effect of these forces is then an empirical mat-

ter. The evidence collected on productivity in
the United States and Europe is not conclusive.32
In developing countries, effects are positive in
Malaysia, Mexico, and Uruguay, but negative in
Brazil.33 Findings suggest that unionized firms
undertake more training than nonunionized
firms. But differences in the introduction of new
technologies are not significant.
The institutional structure for collective bargaining can differ considerably across countries,
especially in the degree of centralization and coordination. Arrangements vary from firm-level
bargaining with no influence on other firms to
industry-based bargaining to centralized bargaining with national coverage. Prior to the
1990s, researchers found that both centralized
and decentralized bargaining led to better employment performance. Analysis has been less
conclusive since then, however.34
With policy changes, some developing countries and emerging economies have extended
worker representation and are seeing new forms
of collective bargaining. In China, for example,
a number of legislative reforms appear to have

Are bargaining councils the cause of unemployment in South Africa?

With unemployment rates well above 20 percent, the South African
labor market is very different from that of other developing countries, usually characterized by low or moderate levels of open unemployment. Diverse explanations have been put forward, including
growth concentrated in low-labor-intensity sectors, skills deficits,
work disincentives created by social benefits, and various legacies of
apartheid. South Africa’s distinct collective bargaining arrangements
are also frequently mentioned as a possible explanation for the lack
of jobs.
Since the 1920s, bargaining over wages and working conditions
in most of South Africa’s manufacturing sector has taken place
through industrial councils, now known as bargaining councils.
­Bargaining councils can request that agreements be extended to
their entire sector, including to employers and workers who did not
participate in the negotiations. Extensions are common but vary
considerably across sectors and areas. Firm-level bargaining also
occurs. It has been argued that sectorwide extensions of bargaining
council agreements impose a heavy labor cost burden on small
firms, undermining employment creation.a
Estimates of wage premiums as high as 60 percent for union
members appeared to provide some credence to this argument.b A
substantial part of this wage effect was associated with industries
that could possibly reflect the influence of the councils. Subsequent
research using more recent data and better methodologies has concluded that early studies overestimated the real wage effect of the
bargaining council agreements. The latest research suggests the
wage premium is in the 10–20 percent range.c This level is signifi-

cant but more in line with union wage d
­ ifferentials observed in
other countries. Evidence also suggests that bargaining council
extensions do have effects as well, adding around 10 percent to the
wages of nonunion workers within the bargaining council system.d
These results imply that the South Africa’s wage-setting institutions do have some employment effects, especially among small
firms, whose contribution to total job creation is small by international standards. Bargaining councils are estimated to be associated
with 8–13 percent lower employment in the firms they cover directly
and with 7–16 percent lower employment in small firms.e
While these effects are not trivial, bargaining councils can
explain only a small part of South Africa’s unusually high unemployment rates. Given the number of workers employed in industries
covered by collective agreements, eliminating the employment
effect of bargaining councils would reduce the unemployment rate
by 1.5 percentage points, at the most.f So the main constraints to
job creation may lie elsewhere.
One clue is the relatively small size of the informal sector compared to other countries at a similar development level. South Africa
is different from these countries in other ways, too. During the
apartheid period, slum clearance, harsh licensing, and strict zoning
regulations rid cities of black-dominated informal sector niches.
Two decades after the end of apartheid, spatial segregation remains,
and investment in black-dominated areas is low.g The legacy of separation also results in high transportation costs for the unemployed,
who tend to live far from where the jobs are. So South Africa’s job
creation problems may stem primarily from urban issues.

opened the door to a proliferation of unions
and collective bargaining agreements (box 8.3).

Voice beyond the firm
Employers’ organizations and unions also play
roles as social and political agents. They may influence the laws that regulate labor markets and
even policies beyond the sphere of labor relations. The nature of such involvement depends
on the norms and institutional framework in
the society in which they operate. Historically,
labor unions have contributed to the establishment of social and labor rights, as well as to political change, in many countries. For instance,

Solidarność, a Polish trade union federation,
was prominent in the fight against Communist
rule, while the Confederation of South African
Trade Unions played a leading role in the fight
against apartheid.
In some countries, especially developing
countries, the political involvement of unions
can overshadow their activities at the workplace.35 Because their membership is strong in
the civil service and in protected sectors, unions
have often opposed reforms involving fiscal
consolidation, privatization, or liberalization. A
comparison of economic performances in times
of reform shows that developing countries with
higher union membership and higher shares of

New forms of collective bargaining are emerging in China

Since the turn of the century, China has undergone important
changes in labor policies, including enactment of new laws regarding trade unions (in 2001) and employment promotion, labor contracts, and labor dispute mediation and arbitration (in 2007). These
changes have been accompanied by rapid growth in the number of
unionized workers and workers covered by wage or collective
agreements (more than 150 million at present). In addition to the
spread of unionization and c­ ollective agreements, the International
Labour Organization (ILO) has documented the gradual spread in
the direct election of union representatives by workers. Such
changes reflect a policy shift that “is intended to bring better protection of workers’ rights, to create a new balance between flexibility and security and to facilitate a dialogue between employers and
workers on issues of mutual concern.”a
Another notable change over the past decade has been the
introduction of local, sectoral-based collective bargaining agreements. The first of these agreements was negotiated in 2003 in the
wool-sweater manufacturing industry in the Xinhe district of Wenling in Zhejiang province.b This is a district known as an example of
transparency and local democracy. Since then, these agreements
have been most prominent in Zhejiang, but have also spread to
some other coastal provinces.c For the most part, local, sectoral-

based bargaining has emerged where industries cluster around a
district or village. By the end of 2010, this form of bargaining covered over 5 million workers through 73,000 agreements.d
The spread of local, sectoral collective bargaining agreements
has occurred against the backdrop of a vibrant private sector
increasingly facing labor shortages and an inadequately regulated
labor market that has led to many disruptive labor disputes. In
some cases, these agreements appear to protect workers’ rights
more effectively.e At the same time, the private sector can also benefit from a more stable relationship with workers, a more reliable
supply of labor, and more regular and transparent changes in labor
costs.
The forms of collective representation in China are diversifying,
with government encouragement. Although evidence is only gradually emerging about the consequences of these changes, some
research suggests that sectoral bargaining at the district or local
level holds the most promise.f Centralized “top-down” efforts have
been made to spur the proliferation of these agreements, with limited success. But the spontaneous spread of this spatial organization
of collective bargaining suggests that it matches well the interest of
the private sector in coordinating the operation of industrial clusters with the interest of workers to have voice in the workplace.

employment in the public sector (where most
unionized workers are) experienced deeper declines in economic activity before the adoption
of major reforms and slower recoveries afterward.36 This finding is consistent with the reforms being adopted late, and their implementation being watered-down. On the other hand,
the level of minimum wages and social security
benefits did not affect performance, suggesting
that trade unions made a difference because of
their political activities, more than because of
their impact on labor costs.
Trade unions organized around the employeremployee relationship are less suited to providing voice to those who do not work for a wage.
The high incidence of self-employment in most
developing countries, and the persistence of informality more generally, have created impetus
for innovative institutions for collective representation. These institutions are different from
traditional unions because the market imperfec-

tions and institutional failures they address do
not involve conventional employer-employee
relationships or workplace-based production
structures. They are often organized to represent
members’ interests with a particular municipal
authority or local government.
Associations of self-employed workers are
emerging as a vehicle to demand and protect
their members’ rights and improve their working conditions. Some of them have drawn their
inspiration from India’s Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), which was created 40
years ago. In many cases, groups such as street
vendors in Lima, Peru, or garbage collectors in
Pune, India, may not only negotiate with government authorities but also resort to litigation
in the courts. Waste pickers in Bogotá, Colombia, organized to defend their right to provide
services to municipalities (box 8.4). Street vendors associations in Durban, South Africa, filed
cases in court against the construction of malls

Recicladores forced changes in Bogotá’s solid waste management policies

Waste pickers, or recicladores, in Colombia’s capital earn a living
by  recycling metals, cardboard, paper, plastic, and glass and selling them through intermediaries. Efficiency considerations aside,
their experience shows how associations of informal workers can
use legal frameworks to access rights.
When reforms for the tendering of public services allowed
municipal governments to give exclusive contracts to private companies for collecting, transporting, and disposing waste and recyclables, the recicladores organized and filed legal claims. Organizations such as the Asociación de Recicladores de Bogotá (ARB), an
umbrella association of groups representing more than 25,000
waste pickers, played a key role in aggregating claims and taking
cases forward. In making its case, the ARB appealed to the constitution’s provision of the “right to equality,” arguing that waste pickers

need preferential treatment and judicial affirmative action in the
tendering and bidding process for government contracts to manage waste.
In 2003, the Constitutional Court ruled that the municipal government’s tendering process for sanitation services had violated the
basic rights of waste pickers. Subsequent cases have referred to
constitutional provisions including the “right to survival” as an
expression of the “right to life.” Article 11 of the constitution was
invoked to argue the right to pursue waste picking as a livelihood
and the “right to pursue business and trade.” Article 333 was invoked
to argue that cooperatives of waste pickers, not just corporations,
can compete in waste recycling markets. The most recent case in
December 2011 halted a US$1.37 billion contract for the collection
and removal of waste in the city.

and against harassment and confiscation of their
inventories of goods by municipal authorities.37
These nontraditional workers’ organizations
are increasingly participating in global institutions such as the ILO. For instance, the International Domestic Workers Network attended the
International Labour Conference in 2009 in order to prepare for discussion and vote on a new
ILO convention on domestic work at the International Labour Conferences in 2010 and 2011.38

Active labor market programs:
Effective within limits
Active labor market programs (ALMPs) can
improve the efficiency of job matching by
transmitting information on job openings
and worker characteristics between employers and jobseekers. They can fill the gap when
employers or workers underinvest in training
because of various market failures, and they
can mitigate the impacts of economic downturns by providing workers with temporary
employment or creating incentives for employers to hire. ALMPs are politically attractive for
governments eager to do something about job
creation.
The most common active labor market
­programs are job search assistance, wage subsidies, training, and public works.39 In terms
of size, interventions range from huge public

works programs such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
Act (MGNREGA), offering work to millions in
rural India, to tailor-made life-skill courses for
small groups of young participants in the Dominican Republic. All ALMPs strive to foster
new job opportunities, often for those with the
fewest chances in the labor market.

A panorama of programs
Job search assistance. These are services providing information on job vacancies and jobseekers
and offering counseling and placement support.
Evaluations indicate that job search assistance
can improve employment and earnings at a low
cost—but only when job vacancies exist. By providing information and making the labor market more meritocratic, more effective matching
can have positive productivity effects. But job
search assistance is less relevant in countries
where a majority of the workers are farmers and
self-employed.
In many high-income and some middleincome countries with largely formal labor markets, job search services have been overhauled in
the past 10 years. Although public financing remains the norm, private provision of services has
become more common. Performance contracts
are being used to create incentives for providers. These contracts must ensure that providers
reach those in most need and do not concen-

267

268  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

trate only on those who are easy to place.40 Job
search support is increasingly being integrated
with a range of complementary services such
as profiling to assess opportunities, life skills, or
other training. “Activation” strategies requiring
job seekers to be brisk, are also becoming more
common. Ultimately, the success of job search
services depends on the capacity of providers to
reach out to employers’ needs.41
Potentially game-changing technological innovations are now extending the reach of traditional intermediation.42 Mobile phones and
the Internet have opened up possibilities for
inclusive information access, connecting unregistered firms and hard-to-reach youth. New
actors, including both businesses and nonprofit
organizations, have emerged and run services in
various country settings (box 8.5).
Wage subsidies. These are direct transfers to
employers or reductions in their taxes or social contributions to encourage them to hire
new workers or to keep employees who might
otherwise be laid off. Wage subsidies work best
when they are targeted to particular groups,
such as young people who need an opportunity

BOX 8.5 

to demonstrate their skills, or the long-term
unemployed who are at risk of suffering “scarring” effects.43 But many studies show that they
often do not have their intended effect of creating new jobs in a cost-effective fashion.44
The real costs of wage subsidies are often hard
to calculate; the direct toll on the public purse
is only part of the story. To access the subsidies,
firms might replace ineligible workers with
eligible ones or dismiss and then hire the same
worker under the subsidy program. If firms
would have hired anyway, the employment effect of a subsidy is zero. Design can help increase
cost-effectiveness. Improvements in the targeting and other features of a subsidy program in
Turkey reduced this “deadweight loss,” although
somewhere between 25 and 50 percent of all
subsidized jobs would have still been created
without the subsidy.45 Proper cost accounting
can reduce the estimated employment impact of
wage subsidies by up to 90 percent.46 Aggregate
employment effects are hence low at best. Alternative designs, especially to reach the young and
low-skilled, can include a wage subsidy linked
to other active labor market programs such as
training.47 The Jóvenes programs and similar in-

E-links to jobs: New technologies open new frontiers

New technologies are revolutionizing how people connect with
jobs. Mobile phones have spread widely and have penetrated
low-income households around the world. Over 4 billion people
have cell phone access, and 1.5 billion have regular access to the
Internet.
Text messaging, voice, and mobile applications give jobseekers
and employers access to information and job counseling ­services
that improve résumés and interview skills and establish networks.
Voice-based services are particularly important for illiterate jobseekers. Companies or nonprofit organizations such as Souktel,
Assured Labor, Babajob, and Labournet, operating in places as
diverse as Latin America, India, and the Middle East, have established thriving job matching networks. Souktel, for example, has
17,000 jobseekers and 600 companies registered in West Bank and
Gaza alone. Sixty percent of registered employers reported they
had cut recruiting time and costs by more than 50 percent.
Some organizations, such as Assured Labor, specifically focus on
services for middle- to low-wage workers, most without college
degrees. Currently, Assured Labor has 150,000 registered jobseekers
and 2,000 employers in Mexico. Similarly, Babajob and Labournet in
India serve 200,000 and 100,000 jobseekers who can search for
em­ployment in databases containing 40,000 and 45,000 employers,
respectively. Labournet is unique in that it serves the informal labor

market, focusing on sectors such as construction and facility
management.
While these companies and organizations have been successful,
others such as Konbit in Haiti and PULS in Pakistan had to overcome
significant difficulties. Challenges have included attracting sufficient
numbers of jobseekers and employers, building trust among users,
and ensuring adequate assurance on the quality of jobseekers. In
response, Konbit has tried to increase the number of users by partnering with a locally famous radio disk jockey and mobile phone provider to advertise its service. Through these efforts, the company
was successful in attracting 10,000 jobseekers in one month.
The Internet also brings together jobseekers and employers
through online platforms. The large and fast growing oDesk connects about 350,000 companies (mainly small and medium enterprises) with individual contractors worldwide. From April to June
2012, oDesk posted online close to 450,000 jobs and more than
280,000 job applications. Jobs range from typing, web research, and
translation to software development and back-office legal services.
Wages range from US$1 to several hundred US$ per hour. While this
new phenomenon has the potential to create many new jobs and
generate substantial new wealth, online platforms generally serve
people with specialized and technical skills, and as such, reach few of
the most vulnerable.

Training for jobseekers. Training is the most
widely used active labor market program. The
growing body of impact evaluations underlines
the importance of aligning the skills taught with
labor demand. These evaluations show that
positive benefits are not guaranteed and program costs can be substantial. When programs
are well conceived and implemented, however,
they can benefit those furthest from jobs the
most. In Latin American countries, and in transition economies such as Romania, youth and
women record significantly higher success rates
from training than do middle-aged men.52
Some design features are critical for success. Integrated programs that include both onthe-job and classroom components pay off.
Especially in developed and Latin American
countries, training for job seekers now often
follows this integrated model, sometimes with
complementary services such as life skills training and counseling. Such combinations increase
success rates (figure 8.3).53 The Jóvenes programs in Latin America, which combine life-­
skills and technical training with work experience, are a case in point. In Colombia, Jóvenes
en Acción has increased employability of trainees, with an estimated rate of return of 13.5–25
percent for female participants.54
In addition, providers need incentives to ensure that the training they offer is relevant for
the needs of employers. Public training agencies
often respond too slowly to changing demands
from firms and jobseekers alike. Where a country’s institutional capacity and supply of training

terventions in several Latin American countries
have employed this model with positive results.48
The impact of wage subsidies tends to rise
with tight targeting and the extent of the disadvantage of the beneficiary group. In Morocco,
the Idmaj youth wage subsidy effectively eased
labor market entry for beneficiaries.49 Argentina provided wage subsidies to employers hiring former participants in large public works
programs. These workers exerted more effort
in searching for jobs and were perceived as
more trustworthy than other similar workers.
That was true especially for women and young
participants.50 But the narrower the focus, the
higher the potential stigma effects. In Poland,
men eligible for the wage subsidies were actually
less likely to be employed.51

organizations allows, public training funds can
be directed to private and nonprofit providers in
competitive terms. Performance-based tendering can create incentives for more relevant training, while contracting can be designed so that
the toughest-to-reach groups do not lose out. In
Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia, public employment services purchase training programs from various providers through
public tenders.
Research shows that at least some training
programs help build trust and civic engagement, but information about how that happens
is scant. In Tunisia, the inclusion of entrepreneurship training in education curricula reform
improved participants’ optimism about the
future.55 In the Dominican Republic, participants in the Juventud y Empleo program were
more likely to have higher expectations for the
future, higher job satisfaction, and more intensive search attitudes.56 In northern Uganda, participation in a comprehensive intervention that
combined grants, vocational training, life skills,
and psychosocial counseling was successful in
increasing community participation.57
Public works. These programs offer short-term
employment for wages or food. The evidence

269

270  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

from impact evaluations shows that public
works programs can be useful as a safety net,
especially when targeted toward those in the
greatest need.58 Careful setting of the wage level
can be a self-targeting tool as has been done in
Colombia’s Empleo en Acción and Argentina’s
Trabajar programs. A similar targeting approach
is being used in India’s MGNREGA program,
which is notable not only for its scale and cost
but also for its rights-based approach in guaranteeing employment (box 8.6).
But seldom are public works a springboard
for better jobs in the future. There is little evidence that they help participants get a job after
they leave the program.59 Compared with other
ALMPs, public works programs have the lowest
placement rates after completion and the highest costs per placement (figure 8.4). In Poland
and Romania, public works have even adversely
affected employability.60 Their productivity impact, hence, tends to be very low at best.
To become a jobs ladder, public works programs need to go beyond poverty relief—a
route some countries already are taking. In El
Salvador and Papua New Guinea, participants
in public works programs obtain additional
technical and life-skills support. In Sierra Leone,
the package comes with compulsory literacy
and numeracy training, and in Liberia with lifeskills training. In Bangladesh, the beneficiaries
of a rural employment scheme were referred to
microfinance institutions; three years after the
program closed, almost 80 percent were still
self-employed in microenterprise activities.61
But overall, very few public works programs
succeed in improving the long-run employability of participants.
Public works have the potential to contribute
to social cohesion though, especially in conflictaffected countries. Soon after the conflict ended
in Sierra Leone, a workfare program was launched
to help rebuild infrastructure and provide shortterm employment opportunities to the poor and
ex-combatants. Public works programs have also
been launched and scaled up in Guinea, GuineaBissau, Liberia, and the Republic of Yemen.
In Serbia, participants felt socially more included
as a result of a public works program.62

Striving to deliver better outcomes
While many programs have met expectations
in countries with very different job challenges,

many others have not succeeded in improving outcomes for participants. Moreover, while
some programs are affordable, others are expensive. Outcomes for ALMPs depend on their design but also on the institutional capacity of the
country to provide services on a national scale
and on a continuous basis.
Program and policy design has been revamped in many countries in recent years to
achieve better performance. Public funds increasingly finance private or nonprofit provi­
sion. In aging and formalizing countries, a forthcoming attitude by jobseekers is increasingly
required for them to remain eligible for unemployment and other social benefits. Such activation measures create incentives for job search
through participation in training or education
courses, counseling and other employment services, or public works.
Many industrial countries are implementing such policies through “one-stop shops” for
the administration of both social benefits and
ALMPs. Germany’s Jobcenter and the United
Kingdom’s JobCentre Plus are examples. This
integrated approach can in principle help workers maintain or create links in society, albeit evidence here is scant.63 The one-stop-shop model
is gaining momentum in a number of developing countries as varied as Argentina, Azerbaijan,
and Bulgaria.
Another important delivery reform is the
growing investment in identifying the employment constraints faced by jobseekers. Obstacles
to finding jobs may range from inadequate skills
to health issues to difficulties balancing family
responsibilities with work. Statistical profiling,
where individual characteristics of beneficiaries
are linked with likely constraints and appropriate remedies, has become an important tool,
especially in countries with significant institutional capacity.64 Comprehensive programs like
Chile Solidario invest heavily in linking beneficiaries to the most appropriate programs depending on their constraints.
In sum, ALMPs can make a difference, but
they need to be well aligned to the needs of the
labor market and designed to address the market imperfections and institutional failures that
hinder desired employment outcomes. Overall,
evaluations of programs with youth participants show that developing countries have better results than industrial countries in fostering
employability. 65 The time horizon also matters:

 he Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act launched the biggest public
T
works program in the world

Public works programs have been actively used in India since the
1950s. Yet no scheme has had a scope or budget on the scale of
the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
(MGNREGA). Launched in 2006 and implemented in three rollout
phases, this program guarantees jobs to all districts with rural populations. The program aims to provide wage employment, improve
the purchasing power of the rural poor, create assets for the community, strengthen natural resource management, and foster social
and gender equality.a
The program guarantees up to 100 days of employment a year to
rural households with adult members willing to do unskilled work at
a wage that is roughly the state statutory minimum wage.b Rural
households wanting to participate in the program are required to
register with their respective village council (gram ­panchayats) and
are issued a free job card with photographs of all members living in
it. A job card holder may apply for employment and the government
must provide it within 15 days. If the government fails to do so, in
principle a daily unemployment allowance must be given to the
applicant. Each household decides how to distribute employment
among its members. Daily wages are based on the amount of work
done and are paid directly into post office or bank accounts. The
program includes some provision for adequate worksite facilities,
including access to safe drinking water, shade, a first aid kit in case of
accident, and crèches for women to leave their children. The program encourages the participation of women through a mandate
that they should account for 33 percent of employed workers. In
addition, wages have to be equal for men and women, work has to
be provided within five kilometers of the applicant’s village, and
gender discrimination of any type is forbidden.c
Most of the public works carried out under MGNREGA are labor
intensive; contractors and machines are not allowed on work sites.
Projects are meant to be chosen in open village meetings (gram sabhas) to reflect village priorities, and local councils play a substantive
role in planning, implementing, and monitoring them. The projects
mainly focus on developing and maintaining community assets
such as water conservation and water harvesting, irrigation channels, and rural roads. Drought proofing, flood control, and land
development are also supported by the program. The central government bears 90 percent of the total cost, covering participants’
wages in full and 75 percent of materials and administrative
expenses.d State governments pay for 25 percent of materials and
administrative costs, the daily unemployment allowance, and the
expenses of the state employment guarantee council. The act also
calls for accountability through the use of information and communication technology, social audits, and third-party monitoring.e

During the program’s first phase in 2006–07, the budget outlay
was US$2.49 billion. The program issued 37 million job cards and
provided on average 43 person-days of work to 21 million households, totaling 0.9 billion person-days of work. Since then, the program has expanded substantially in its coverage and budget. During fiscal year 2010–11, 55 million households were provided an
average of 47 person-days of work, totaling 2.5 billion person-days
at a cost of US$8.7 billion (0.51 percent of GDP).f That makes MGNREGA the largest workfare program in the world. Participation of the
poor and vulnerable has been quite significant according to administrative data.
Critics argue that MGNREGA may be affecting the functioning of
rural labor markets. By setting the wage paid by the program at
roughly Rs 100 (US$1.80) a day, it may help to enforce a sort of minimum wage for all casual rural work. If that is above the normal wage
offered, the program may be altering the supply of casual labor and
crowding out private employers.g It may also be constraining the
process of labor reallocation out of agriculture and into more productive sectors.
The program has received considerable media attention be­­
cause of alleged corruption, leakage, inadequate implementation,
and the like. But few studies have attempted to assess its impact on
rural households, rural labor markets, and productivity in a systematic way. Among the emerging evidence, a striking finding is that
participation rates in areas where the program is most needed are
not the highest.h Household surveys show evidence of rationing
and unmet demand, limiting the poverty alleviation impact of the
program. Yet, despite the rationing, the program is reaching poor
people and attracting women and disadvantaged castes into the
workforce.i One study in the state of Andhra Pradesh suggests the
program increases expenditure on food and nonfood goods.j Evidence of effects on wage levels in rural labor markets and on labor
reallocation is still inconclusive. Studies on non-labor-market effects
of the program are scant.
Several challenges face the MGNREGA program. Addressing
­leakage and transparency is one. The government has taken this
challenge seriously, for example, through the adoption of
­biometric-unique identification cards. Improving the quality and
relevance of the communal assets to generate wider and long-term
effects is another challenge. But the biggest one is ensuring that
demand for work is met, and that wages are paid fully and on time.
Also, if the program’s objective is to lift the poorest, the program
should accommodate those whose physical conditions do not allow
them to perform hard manual work.k

in industrial countries, training programs show
their real value only in the medium to longer
run.66 But a thorough understanding of the jobs
challenge faced and a good sense of institutional
capacities are critical when deciding whether a
specific ALMP could be part of the solution.
Even with these innovations, expectations for
active labor market programs need to be kept in
check. Job search and intermediation can work
only if firms are creating jobs. Short training
courses cannot solve a fundamental problem in
the education system. Activation incentives will
be fruitless if deep-rooted discrimination causes
people to withdraw from a job search.

Social insurance: The challenge of
expanding coverage
Many people are unable or unwilling to save
against major risks such as job loss, disability,
the death of a breadwinner, or aging without
resources. Because insurers cannot accurately
assess individual risk (adverse selection) and be-

cause individuals can influence that level of risk
(moral hazard), markets do not provide adequate risk pooling. Social insurance is a package
of programs that can potentially address market failures such as these. But social insurance
programs are also shaped by history, values, and
politics, so their design is not exclusively aimed
at improving efficiency.
Some countries have introduced public unemployment insurance systems to help workers mitigate the risk of job loss. Many have
disability insurance to cover situations where
illness or injury affects employment opportunities. Most countries also have social safety
nets that, while not directly tied to employment status, can provide a coping mechanism
when earnings are insufficient to meet a basic
living standard.
Other social insurance programs not directly
related to labor market risks are often tied to the
jobs that people have or to their employment
status. The most important of these are old-age
pensions and health insurance programs that
are financed by payroll taxes (social security
contributions) from employers, employees, or
both. These benefits are publicly provided because of imperfections in the insurance market,
not in the labor market. However, they can have
important consequences for the types of jobs
that are created and thus for productivity. Financing them through payroll taxes can affect
labor demand and employer choices on whether
to provide insurance coverage as part of the employment contract. It can also influence workers’ behavior, including their incentives to take,
keep, and switch jobs, to work in the formal or
the informal sector, and to engage in work with
higher risks and returns.
From a jobs perspective, the major questions
are twofold: how to manage labor market risks
and how to design the financing of other types
of social insurance to have the most favorable
impact on employment.

Managing labor market risks
In low-income countries, managing income
loss is more important than managing the loss
of a job. When most people are engaged in subsistence agriculture or are self-employed, open
unemployment is not a common occurrence. In
these contexts, social safety nets, including non-

	

contributory cash transfers and public works
programs, can be critically important to cope
with adverse shocks.67
However, when wage employment is more
prevalent, unemployment insurance may be a
higher priority. Unemployment insurance can
provide income support to workers who lose
their jobs and prevent individuals and households from falling into poverty. By supporting
a job search, it can result in better matches and
efficiency gains. Effective coverage is far from
complete, however; according to the ILO, only 15
percent of the unemployed worldwide received
benefits during the recent financial crisis.68 Another concern with unemployment benefit systems is that they may reduce incentives to keep
jobs, look for jobs, or accept a job offer. Most of
the evidence on the incentive effects of unemployment benefits comes from industrial countries and is mixed. Some studies find that more
generous benefits—either through higher benefit levels, or longer duration of benefits—can increase either the length of unemployment or the
unemployment rate.69 Exits from unemployment typically increase when benefits expire.70
Over the past decade, unemployment insurance eligibility and benefits have been reformed
in a number of countries to reduce job search
disincentives. While some disincentive effects
are inherent in any unemployment insurance
system, recent studies for Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain found that even if
workers remain unemployed for a longer period
of time, they are eventually able to find more stable jobs.71 Studies of unemployment insurance
in Brazil found that benefits did not affect the
duration of unemployment, except when workers were moving from unemployment to selfemployment. In this case the transition period
was shorter, suggesting that benefits may have
made it possible to start a new business.72
Concerns about job search disincentives and
hidden redistribution have led to some interest
in unemployment insurance savings accounts.
While the design can vary, workers make contributions to the accounts and can draw money
from them during unemployment spells. Any
remaining balance is paid out when the worker
retires and can be used as a pension top-up.
Some countries, mainly in Latin America but
also Austria and Jordan, have adopted these
savings accounts as an alternative approach to

Labor policies revisited   

insurance-based programs. But insurance savings accounts do not allow for risk pooling, so
that young workers and workers with frequent
unemployment spells may not have adequate
savings. To address this concern, some plans
have a redistribution feature. For example,
Chile’s program includes a Solidarity Fund to
support workers whose account balances are
too low to provide adequate income support
during unemployment.
In all countries, disability is an important labor market risk. According to recent estimates,
the prevalence of disability is about 15 percent
of the adult population. Rates are higher in lowincome countries and in aging societies.73 Although many people with disabilities do work,
inactivity rates among them are significantly
higher than for the overall population. In industrial countries, the inactivity rate for persons
with disabilities is about 2.5 times higher than it
is for those without disability.74
Disability benefits can provide important
income protection, but costs have mounted in
some countries and the benefits can create work
disincentives among the general population.
Accommodation of workplaces to persons with
disabilities is an important strategy to encourage them to seek employment. Benefit systems
can be adjusted to this end as well. In-work
payments, time-limited benefits, and working
tax credits are all being tested in the European
Union.75 Countries without disability benefits
need to emphasize accommodation and rely on
social safety nets where disability is associated
with poverty.

Financing social insurance
A salient feature of social insurance programs
in developing countries is their low coverage.76
Across the world only 30 percent of workers
have access to social insurance; in Africa and
Asia, the share is less than 25 percent (map 8.1).
On average, coverage rates are highest in aging
societies and formalizing countries and lowest in conflict-affected countries and agrarian
economies, where less than 10 percent of the
working population is enrolled in pension programs. In general, low-income workers are the
least likely to be covered. In most countries in
Latin America, coverage rates are below 10 percent in the bottom income quintile but above 50

percent in the top quintile.77 Even if workers are
covered on paper by social insurance, they may
not necessarily receive benefits. Effective coverage can be reduced by fiscal pressures and low
implementation capacity.
Coverage is low for multiple reasons, including limited fiscal space to finance programs, low
institutional capacity to manage the administration and delivery of benefits, fragmented
schemes that cover certain groups and not others, and program design providing weak incentives to participate. In many developing countries, workers and firms in the informal sector
generally fall outside the scope of programs.
Reaching the self-employed, farmers, and migrants is particularly difficult. Social insurance
laws in many countries do not cover micro- and
small enterprises, or these firms and farms opt
out because they cannot afford minimum contribution costs.78 Weak enforcement capacity
also contributes to low coverage.
Payroll taxes (including contributions for social programs) have been the dominant means

of financing social insurance in most countries. But whether payroll taxes are the optimal
model, especially for developing countries, is increasingly being questioned.79 Financing social
insurance through payroll taxes may exacerbate
the coverage problem by creating disincentives
for the creation of formal sector jobs.
Studies in countries such as Colombia, Turkey, and some transition countries in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia have found that increases in the levels of social insurance contributions decreased formal employment, by varying
amounts.80 By contributing to the “tax wedge”
(the gap between total labor costs and takehome pay), payroll taxes to fund social insurance
can discourage both labor demand and the willingness to work. The size of this tax wedge varies
considerably across countries. It is most significant in industrial countries, aging societies, and
formalizing countries (figure 8.5).
However, a complete assessment needs to
take into account the value that workers place
on access to social insurance. Social contribu-

tions should not be seen as a pure tax when contributors attach value to the attendant benefits.
And the evidence largely suggests that they do.81
When asked to name the essential elements of a
good job, people in China, Colombia, the Arab
Republic of Egypt, and Sierra Leone rated access
to pensions and health insurance equally with
good wages. In those countries, workers who
participate in social insurance systems indicated
that they would require substantial income increases to compensate for losing access to social
insurance. At the same time, workers outside
these systems would be willing to contribute a
significant portion of their pay to participate
(figure 8.6).82 But design and implementation
matter, because the value attached to participation depends to a significant degree on the
adequacy of benefits relative to contributions
and the efficiency and transparency of benefits
administration. The long-term credibility of the
social insurance system is also a critical factor,
especially in aging societies.
In trying to extend the coverage of social
protection in developing countries, two important issues need to be addressed. The first one
is which risks are the priorities to address. In
low-income countries, pensions for old-age and
disability and basic health insurance are more
important than unemployment insurance.
The second issue is how to extend the priority programs to workers in the informal sector.
Some countries are using technology in innovative ways to make participation by informal
sector workers easier (box 8.7). But technology
alone cannot overcome the market imperfections and institutional failures that result in low
social protection coverage. For instance, mobile phones may make it easier for farmers to
pay contributions toward health insurance, but
those less prone to be ill may still choose not to
enroll. This is why extending social protection
coverage requires adequate regulations and resources, in addition to modern “technology.”
One approach is to run a parallel system for
informal sector workers in conjunction with the
contributory system. This approach addresses
the coverage gap, but if the parallel system is
funded out of general tax revenue, it discourages enrollment in the contributory system and
can hinder the development of the formal sector. These problems could be addressed to some

Modern technology can reduce social protection costs, leakage, and corruption

Innovative technology-based approaches are transforming the
ways in which insurance and other cash benefits are provided.
India’s new health insurance scheme for the poor uses biometric
smart cards both to verify that households are eligible and to keep
track of hospital procedures not involving cash payments. Almost
30 million households now hold these smart cards. According to a
recent report from the U.K. Department for International Development, “evidence from South Africa, India, Kenya, and Liberia has
demonstrated that electronic payment systems involving smart
cards or mobile phones can significantly reduce costs and leakage.”a
Another report, by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, finds
significant reductions in transaction costs through electronic payments in Brazil and Colombia. These “front-end” applications help
overcome several problems that have plagued service delivery in
the past, including the need for beneficiaries to go long distances to
obtain benefits and for middlemen to fill out forms.
Many developing countries lack robust systems for identifying
people, allowing fraud of various kinds, and preventing many
among the poor from accessing social programs. In the Dominican
Republic, for example, one-quarter of eligible beneficiaries for a
poverty program could not participate because they lacked proper
documents. Poor identification also hampers efforts to coordinate
across government and donor-sponsored programs and leads to
duplication of costs. To confront this challenge, a growing number
of countries is moving to biometric technology. India’s unique identification program, known as Aadhaar, is the most ambitious so far,
having collected digital fingerprints and iris scans for close to 200

million people. Applications such as mobile phones with fingerprint
readers that would allow online verification of identity acceptable
to service providers are now being piloted.
Less glamorous, but just as important, is the “back-end” part of
social protection systems, which allows tracking of transactions on a
regular basis and generation of key indicators and reports. The Management Information Systems (MIS) are arguably even more important for complex social insurance programs, especially as populations age and noncommunicable diseases become more prevalent.
Keeping track of work histories allows for a better alignment of pension benefits and social security contributions. Databases of medical histories support a more efficient design of health protocols and
payments to health care providers.
Information is no longer the sole domain of those administering
the program, however. One of the applications of modern technology with the most potential impact is citizen reporting of acts of
corruption and negligence through social media. Massive mobile
phone penetration has been an especially empowering tool.
Technology is not a panacea, however, and failed projects are
common. In most cases, the technology is not matched with a
re­engineering of the processes involved. Other common problems
include poor planning and procurement practices, asymmetric
information between government and vendors, and lack of trained
personnel to operate the systems after they are in place. Despite
these problems, the future of social protection will inevitably
include creative ways of applying new technology.

Another approach is to partially subsidize
participation by farmers and the self-employed
in general social insurance programs. In Vietnam, those classified as poor get their health
insurance cards fully paid by the budget, while
the “near poor” get a 50 percent subsidy.84 This
second approach may look similar to the previous one, as funding relies on general tax revenue
too. But it has the advantage of not discouraging formalization. From a social cohesion point
of view it also allows building universal systems,
rather than two-tier systems.

Well-designed social insurance and social
protection systems have the potential to enhance the three transformations. Mitigating
labor market distortions and covering priority
risks can compensate for lost income; it can also
contribute to subjective well-being by reducing uncertainty. Portability of benefits from
one job to another and the capacity of systems
to manage transitions can help workers move
to higher-productivity jobs and encourage risk
taking. And extending coverage can contribute
to social cohesion through its role in building an
encompassing social contract.85

QUESTION

Labor policies revisited   

Protecting workers or protecting jobs?

Policies that protect people are usually hailed as
being better than policies that protect jobs. Providing income support prevents large drops in
consumption and mitigates the risk of poverty
among households affected by unemployment,
underemployment, or loss of labor earnings.
Relying on transitional income support and,
in some cases retraining programs, rather than
measures to protect jobs allows for the reallocation of labor, keeping up the process of creative
destruction. Resources are thus allocated more
efficiently and economic growth is enhanced.
Preserving jobs that are no longer economically viable through government transfers and
employment protection legislation prolongs an
inefficient allocation of resources.
Moreover, job protection also entails a high
risk of capture. It runs the danger of becoming permanent rather than temporary, creating
enduringly unproductive, subsidized jobs. The
development experience is full of examples in
which explicit job protection has led to little
other than large rents for business owners and
workers in the sectors that benefited from it, stifling technological advance, structural change,
and growth.
The conventional wisdom, then, argues
against the protection of jobs. But in times
when many jobs are lost or threatened at once
and few are being created, such conventional
wisdom needs to be revisited. The productivity
of a protected job can still be higher than that
of the alternative jobs the displaced worker may
find. And the productivity gap may exceed the
costs of keeping the job alive. This is likely to be
the case when the alternative after displacement
is to be jobless for a long period of time. In this
case, in addition to the immediate loss in output, prolonged unemployment can depreciate
skills and undermine social cohesion.
Importantly, it is the overall productivity of
the job that needs to be considered, including its
possible spillovers on the productivity of others.
When people work together, or when they are
connected through broader value chains, the
loss of a large number of jobs may have ripple
effects on productivity. In areas or activities

where jobs have important productivity spillovers, the aggregate loss of output is then more
than the sum of the losses in individual earnings. Massive job losses can then lead to ghost
towns and depressed regions, and this prospect
suggests that the conventional wisdom may not
always be right.

Turnover versus decoupling
Every day, jobs are created and destroyed. Workers are hired and dismissed, or they quit their
jobs and start their own businesses; meanwhile
some firms close and others are born. In industrial countries, this process of creative destruction affects around 15 percent of all jobs every
year.86 In normal times, the probability of job
loss for an individual is largely independent of
the probability of job loss for another. And the
probability of landing another job is also independent of what happens to other workers. The
employment shock is then what economists call
“idiosyncratic.”
But there are exceptional times, when employment shocks are systemic. Then, a sustained
decoupling of the normal process of job creation and job destruction occurs: jobs are lost
in large numbers but not created at the same
pace. This is what occurs in times of severe economic crises, when a decline in economic activity affects a broad swath of firms and industries.
Job destruction accelerates, often sharply, and
job creation levels off or even decreases (figure
8.7). This decoupling leads to unemployment in
formalized economies and under-employment
in less formalized ones.87 In many countries,
droughts, floods, or other natural disasters can
have a similar impact. After the sources of the
crisis dissipate, job creation picks up and unemployment or underemployment declines. The
longer it takes for job creation to recover, the
longer unemployment or under­
employment
lasts.
Decoupling can also occur in times of massive structural change brought about by rapid
technical progress (for example, the introduction of computers) or policy reforms (for exam-

ple, trade liberalization). Structural change can
affect entire industries. In transition economies,
such changes were enormous, as entire sectors
economies had to cope with uncertainty and
adapt to new incentives. Public sector restructuring or the privatization of state-owned enterprises can cause a similar shock. In all these
cases, unemployment and underemployment
can be large and long-lasting.
Losses in earnings and output are more pervasive with systemic shocks than with idiosyncratic shocks. But sometimes these two types
of employment shocks can overlap. The recent
financial crisis has led to an unusually deep
recession in many countries. In the United
States, high unemployment rates have persisted,
unemployment spells have lasted longer than
usual, and new job creation is still sluggish four
years after the beginning of the crisis.88 Some
argue that the crisis is not a regular cyclical perturbation but the manifestation of a more enduring shift caused by technological change and
globalization.89

Decoupling hurts
Protecting people should have primacy if shocks
are idiosyncratic—if the employment dislocation is limited and if turnover continues to be
the norm. A variety of social protection mechanisms exist that support people in their transition from one job to another. They concentrate
on sustaining standards of living through unemployment benefits and public transfers. Learning
new skills or relocating to where job opportunities are can also play a role. By moving from an
adversely affected activity to another job, there
is a gain in output that over time outweighs the
cost of the support mechanisms. Protecting people is thus good for individuals and for society.
If massive decoupling occurs—through either
a wider crisis or large-scale structural change—
protecting workers will rarely be enough. Intermediation services falter because jobs are simply not available. Training may help individual
workers land a job, but it does not create many
jobs at the aggregate level, because it does not

	

address the cyclical or structural causes of the
employment shock. Income support through
unemployment benefits and public transfers
may suffer from inadequate funds or seriously
affect fiscal accounts. Only sustained job creation can deal with the effects of decoupling,
but even under the best of circumstances it may
take several years to offset the employment decline from a systemic shock. The question then
is whether providing income support on a large
scale for long periods of time is preferable to
temporarily supporting employment, while job
creation picks up.
The long-term consequences and costs of decoupling can be higher than is usually thought.
During periods of massive structural change,
the reallocation of workers out of declining
­industries can lead to large output losses because little alternative employment is available.
The productivity of jobs in declining industries may be low, but it can still be higher than
the alternatives. Similarly, during crises, firms
might not be insolvent but rather illiquid. Death
of inherently solvent firms could cause loss of
firm-specific human capital and intangible assets, disruption of value chains, and damage
to surrounding communities. While the provision of credit would be the preferred solution,
identifying insolvent firms might not always be
feasible and could be marred by transparency
problems. Temporary job protection policies
can be a workable alternative to provide a lifeline for struggling, but inherently solvent, firms.
Long-term unemployment can also erode
skills and workforce attachment. Aptitudes and
attitudes to perform a given occupation can be
lost.90 “Scarring” can occur, with long-run consequences for finding employment with similar
earnings.91 Human capital and skills depreciate.
Regardless of whether decoupling is the result of
severe downturns or major structural changes,
workers may enter a spiral of unappealing jobs
and lower living standards. The potential costs
might be particularly disruptive to social cohesion. Social networks can be undone in ways
that make it more difficult for the dislocated
to reengage in work and even in other forms of
social activity.92 Prolonged periods of high unemployment are of particular concern because
they can affect young people’s transition from
school to work, and may lead to disenfranchisement from society.93

Labor policies revisited   

In some circumstances, then, job protection
can be considered. What is meant by that is not
permanent restrictions on hiring and firing
through employment protection legislation, but
rather time-bound policy measures that mitigate job destruction. In other words, these are
selectively used active labor market policies that
promote job creation or sustain existing jobs.
Several countries adopted policies of this sort
during the recent recession; Germany, which has
a long tradition with such policies, averted job
losses through a coordinated reduction of hours
of work (box 8.8). The United States also took
measures to protect jobs during the recent recession, most notably by salvaging its auto industry. But the United States relied mostly on aggregate demand stimulation and on extensions
of unemployment insurance to protect workers,
rather than on measures to protect jobs. In relative terms, changes in employment and unemployment in the United States were much larger
than in Germany.94

The pitfalls of protecting jobs
There are examples in developing countries
as well. Chile and Mexico introduced worksharing policies and compensatory subsidies
to moderate the impact of the crisis. But these
policies had a limited impact in their case. Given
their novelty, they required new procedures that
were difficult to implement quickly, resulting in
very low take-up rates. More important, these
policies are not well suited to countries where a
large share of employment is informal, because
they fail to reach the vast majority of employers.
The experiences of Chile and Mexico, two countries with relatively high administrative capacity
that have made progress in formalization, suggest that the usefulness of work-sharing policies
is limited in developing “countries.”
There are positive examples as well. The different ways in which China and many Latin
American countries handled the restructuring of their economies through the 1980s and
1990s are telling. At the beginning of its reform
process, China had hundreds of thousands of
uncompetitive state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
But large-scale labor retrenchment would have
pushed workers into even less productive jobs
until the private sector developed sufficiently
to absorb them. China thus supported its ail-

BOX 8.8 

Kurzarbeit has become a new word in labor market policies

Kurzarbeit (which translates to “short work” or “reduced working
hours”) has been used in Germany for a century. Under this program, employees in participating firms can be asked to cut down on
working hours with a commensurate reduction in compensation.
The German government, through the Federal Employment
Agency, covers a percentage of the ensuing wage loss. Participation
of the firm is tied to the consent of the workers affected.a Thus there
is an emphasis on social dialogue in the implementation of the program. During economic downturns, German employers tend to
respond by reducing the number of hours worked, thereby mitigating the loss in jobs.
More than a dozen countries have adopted programs for
reduced working hours based on the general kurzarbeit model but
involving a variety of designs and regulations.b The countries
where these programs were in place before the global economic
crisis experienced substantial increases in take-up rates during the
2008–09 period.
As a response to the crisis, several countries implementing a
work-share program increased the percentage of wages covered,
extended benefit duration, and relaxed the criteria for qualifying for
the program. In Germany, the period during which firms could
request subsidies was extended from 6 to 24 months; the government coverage of social insurance costs was increased to 50 percent; temporary help workers were made eligible; and the program
was allowed to cover up to 67 percent of wage losses incurred by

affected employees.c It is estimated that more than 1 percent of permanent jobs were saved in Germany through kurzarbeit.d In 2009,
more than 3 percent of the labor force was covered by the
program.
The program is touted as beneficial in that it is less expensive for
government to contribute funds toward paying the lost hours of
work to the employee than to pay unemployment benefits. From
the point of view of the employer, it helps retain skilled staff and
reduces churning and retraining costs, thus maintaining firm productivity. From the perspective of the employee, the scheme prevents unemployment and the problems that come with it such as
loss of income, depreciation of skills, decrease in life satisfaction,
and insecurity. From the societal perspective, it cushions the impact
of the economic downturn and spreads it more evenly across the
labor force.
However, work-share programs only benefit formal sector
employees, and not even all of them. The kurzarbeit is effective in
saving permanent jobs but has no significant impact on temporary
employment or on the hours worked by temporary workers.e Workshare programs are also more effective in countries with less flexible
labor market regulations, where take-up rates are higher.f Furthermore, long-term reliance on this type of program can lead to significant delays in necessary labor reallocation and therefore could hinder growth and productivity in the medium term.

ing SOEs through access to banking credit while
rapidly modernizing its economy, preventing
social disruptions in the process.95 Latin American countries also embarked on the dismantling
of inefficient industries that had developed under import substitution policies. But they did so
more abruptly. Sudden downsizing may have
caused a more durable rise in informality and
led to slower productivity growth.96
The risk with job protection policies is that
they can create permanent inefficiency, especially in countries with weak institutions. Job
protection policies involve firms or even whole

industries that can coordinate to engage in rent
seeking to secure permanent government support. If such policies are adopted, it is necessary
to establish and enforce trigger rules and sunset clauses that define the extent and size of the
protection. If the institutional prerequisites to
ensure that support is temporary do not exist,
or are not credible, job protection policies can
be dangerous indeed. And they should not be
considered at all if job losses do not result from
a systemic employment shock, involving a large
decoupling of job creation and job destruction.

 1.	A particular country can be included in more
than one group. Country types have been classified according to the following definitions. Agrarian economies: a rural share of population of 60
percent or above in 2010 (World Development
Indicators [WDI], World Bank, Washington, DC,
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/worlddevelopment-indicators); conflict-affected countries: derived from a combination of two sources:
(i) countries in the Uppsala Conflict Data Program database with at least 1,000 battle deaths in
an internal or internationalized internal conflict
in 2010, or (ii) with UN peace keeping and peace
building missions (2012 World Bank fragility

less of the population living in urbanized areas
in 2000, and with an increase of 4.5 percentage
points by 2010 (WDI); resource-rich countries:
with mineral exports accounting for at least 20
percent of total exports over 2005–10 (World
Integrated Trade Solution); countries with high
youth unemployment: with a “youth bulge index”
score of 0.90 or above. The youth bulge index
is calculated as total youth employment (2010)
times youth unemployment rate (mean, 2001–
10) divided by total population (2010, WDI);
formalizing economies: pension contributors
representing between 25 and 75 percent of the
total labor force (PDB Provisional Pension Database, February 2012); aging societies: an elderly
population (aged 65 or above) that is more than
8 percent of the working-age group (15-to-64year-olds) (WDI); small island nations: island
nations with a population of less than 2 million (UN Office of the High Representative for
the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing
States and WDI).

for the United States). Employment of women
has been found to fall in several cases as a result
of minimum wage increases (for example, Feliciano 1998 for Mexico and Arango and Pachón
2004 for Colombia), although Pagés and Montenegro (2007) identified a shift in employment
toward women in Chile. Where researchers have
looked at employment effects of minimum
wage increases on the less skilled, they typically
find negative effects (for example, Arango and
Pachón 2004; Kertesi and Kollo 2003; Montenegro and Pagés 2004; and SMERU Research Institute 2001). In general, workers in small firms
are most likely to be affected by employment
losses caused by increases in the minimum wage
(Kertesi and Kollo 2003; Rama 2001). Regarding EPL, Montenegro and Pagés (2004) found
that the introduction of more protective rules
in Chile had adverse effects for women relative to men, for youth relative to the more experienced, and for the skilled relative to the less
skilled. Similarly, cross-country analysis by the

impacts of EPL on women and youth.

declining real minimum wages and less restrictive EPL as factors behind increasing inequality
in many countries.

OECD countries.
20.	 Belot, Boone, and van Ours (2007) find positive
effects, but only in environments where workers
invested in firm-specific skills. Koeniger (2005)
and Nickell and Layard (1999) find positive
productivity effects, but results depended on
estimation specifications. Autor, Kerr, and Kugler (2007) find that increases in employment
protection had a negative effect on total factor
productivity but a positive one on labor productivity. In contrast, Bassanini and Venn (2008)
and Cingano and others (2010) find negative impacts. Bassanini, Nunziata, and Venn (2009) find
that dismissal regulations have a depressing effect
on labor but restrictions on the use of temporary

employment do not. All of these studies are based
on data from industrial countries. In a study of
developed and developing countries, Micco and
Pagés (2006) conclude that labor regulations do
not robustly affect labor productivity. In a study
of Asian and Latin American countries, De­Freitas

some situations and a negative effect in others.

91.	 “Scarring” refers to an increasing probability of
unemployment and lower earnings among those
who have suffered unemployment previously. It
implies that the negative effects of unemployment extend beyond the period of unemployment; see Arulampalam, Gregg, and Gregory
(2001). The term is also used to describe the psychological impacts of unemployment and its duration even after unemployment spells conclude;
see Clark, Georgellis, and Safney (2001); Knabe
and Ratzel (2009).

Beyond labor policies
Fundamentals need to be in place, and constraints to the creation
of jobs with high development payoffs need to be removed or offset.
Policy coordination across borders can help.

A

prerequisite for improved living standards is a policy environment conducive
to private-sector-led job creation. Macro­economic stability, an enabling business environment, human capital, and the rule of law are
all necessary ingredients. Adequate macroeconomic policies mitigate aggregate fluctuations
and keep key relative prices aligned. The business environment provides the basic public
goods needed for the private sector to ­operate:
infrastructure, access to finance, and sound regulation. Human capital is formed through good
nutrition, health, and education that builds human skills. The rule of law ensures the enforcement of contracts; it also includes the progressive
realization of rights to avoid a situation where
growth coexists with unacceptable forms of work.
These are the fundamentals on which policies for
jobs rest (figure 9.1).
Fundamentals alone may not be enough
to facilitate job creation and address the jobs
­challenges faced by many developing countries.
Labor policies need to be set within a sensible
range—a plateau that avoids two cliffs: one is
the misguided intervention that clogs the creation of jobs in cities and in global value chains;
the other, the lack of voice and social protection
especially for the most vulnerable.
Markets might work without much friction
but that may not be sufficient to make smallholder farming more productive in agrarian

economies, or to generate enough employment
opportunities for young men in conflict-­affected
countries.
An active role of government, however, needs
to be carefully considered. Jobs are mainly created by the private sector with government
intervention justified when individual incentives are misaligned with social goals—when,
for example, employment is not rewarding for
women, when young people are “queuing” to
be civil servants, when cities are too congested
to productively absorb more rural migrants, or
when logistics costs are too high for domestic
firms to engage in international trade. In these
cases, government policy should aim to remove
the constraints that prevent individuals, farms,
and firms from making the best choices for society. If constraints cannot be precisely identified, or reforms are not politically feasible, policies can aim at offsetting the constraints rather
than relieving them directly. In most cases, the
policies to create good jobs for development lie
outside of the labor market.
Domestic policies for jobs are part of the solution, but there is also scope for international
coordination. Rights are a global public good—
their violation in one country harms the world.
But policies for job creation in one country can
affect employment and earnings in another,
positively or negatively, while migration policies
can generate opportunities abroad or shut them

down. Labor standards, rules for international
trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), and
migration agreements are among the instruments available to manage these international
spillovers. Inter­national organizations have a role
to play ­in coordinating the important global project of p
­ roducing and using high-quality data on
jobs, on which sound policy making must rest.

FUNDAMENTALS

Establishing the fundamentals
A vast majority of jobs are created by the private sector—in formal sector firms as well as in
microenterprises and farms. The relevant conditions for private sector investment and job creation are macroeconomic stability, an enabling
business environment, human capital, and the
rule of law.

Macroeconomic stability
In its assessment of the policy ingredients of
growth strategies across 13 successful developing countries, the Commission on Employment
and Growth noted: “No economy can flourish in the midst of macroeconomic instability.
Wild fluctuations in the price level, the exchange
rate, the interest rate, or the tax burden serve
as a major deterrent to private investment, the
proximate driver of growth.”1 Macroeconomic
instability also affects employment and earnings
in the short run. According to a recent estimate,
a 1 percent decline in gross domestic product
(GDP) is associated with an increase in the
unemployment rate of 0.19 percentage point
in Japan, 0.45 in the United States, and 0.85 in
Spain.2
In developing countries, where income support mechanisms are more limited, the shortterm impact of macroeconomic instability is often not so much on open unemployment as it is

on the composition of employment. Economic
downturns lead to transitions to informal employment or to household-based activities, and
not necessarily to joblessness. Hence, research
focuses on how macroeconomic fluctuations affect the share of informal employment, rather
than the unemployment rate.3 Country case
studies of the impact of the global crisis have
confirmed the resilience of employment in developing countries. But macroeconomic stability is not less relevant there: while aggregate
fluctuations do not greatly affect the number of
workers employed, they do affect the earnings
of those at work as well as their access to basic
social protection instruments.4
Macroeconomic instability is often the outcome of unsustainable budget deficits and lax
monetary policy. In the 1980s, Brazil plunged
into a debt and high-inflation crisis that slashed
its economic growth and halved the share of exports in its GDP. Triggered by high international
interest rates in the late 1970s, the crisis then
was compounded by the difficulty of keeping
spending by subnational governments in check.
Tight budgets and rigid monetary policy rules
may not be a magic wand, however. Budget deficits are more or less worrisome depending on
how quickly an economy is growing, whereas

the independence of central banks needs to
be weighed against the overall coherence of a
development strategy. An assessment of the
soundness of macroeconomic management requires taking account of the impact of fiscal and
monetary policies on economic growth.5
Not all macroeconomic instability is selfinflicted, however. Turbulence may result from
shocks over which countries have little control, from natural disasters to crises originating
abroad. Precautionary policies can be adopted
to cushion those shocks if and when they occur. But most often there is a need to respond
with short-term stimulus or adjustment packages. The effectiveness of these responses is a
matter of controversy. A recent study based on
the experience of 29 aid-dependent countries
estimates that GDP increases by close to 0.5
percentage points for every percentage point of
GDP in additional government spending. This
so-called multiplier effect is substantially lower
than in the United States, where a range between
0.8 and 1.5 is considered plausible.6
Wild fluctuations are only one way in which
the macroeconomic context can adversely affect
employment and earnings. The misalignment of
key relative prices is another. Surges in a country’s foreign exchange earnings often lead to an
overvaluation of its currency, making imports
more affordable and exports less competitive.
Resource-rich countries in the developing world
face similar currency appreciation pressures.7
The commodity booms of the last few years
have only strengthened these pressures. Currency overvaluation can also happen in countries where large volumes of foreign assistance
are needed to jump-start development, cope
with natural disasters, or facilitate recovery after a conflict. In Afghanistan, for instance, civilian aid from multilateral and bilateral donors
was estimated at around 40 percent of GDP in
2010/11.8 Currency overvaluation is a concern
for many other countries where foreign aid does
not reach the levels in Afghanistan but still funds
a significant fraction of the budget. An analysis of
83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004
confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but induces overvaluation and
has a negative impact on export diversification.9
Avoiding exchange rate misalignment is necessary to sustain a vibrant export sector and
hence create jobs that are connected to interna-

tional markets and global value chains.10 A case
has even been made in favor of currency undervaluation, on the grounds that the export sectors of developing countries suffer disproportionately from institutional failures and market
imperfections.11 However, not all countries in
the world can simultaneously have an undervalued currency. And while the argument that
jobs integrated with world markets have positive growth spillovers is sensible, these jobs are
not necessarily the ones with the highest development payoffs. Different countries have different jobs agendas, from creating employment
opportunities for women to supporting the development of jobs in cities. The exchange rate is
only one instrument and would seldom be able
to deliver on such diverse agendas.

An enabling business environment
Across firms and countries at varying levels of
development, the most important constraints
on formal private sector businesses are remarkably consistent: access to finance, infrastructure,
and aspects of regulation including taxation and
unfair competition (figure 9.2). Skills shortages
are also key, but mainly in the case of large firms
and especially in richer countries.
Access to finance provides firms with the
ability to expand, to invest in new technologies,
or to smooth cash flow over time.12 Financial
markets also play an important role in the allocation of resources toward more productive
uses.13 Transparency within the financial sector
avoids resources being channeled to those with
political connections or economic power, and
it also supports financial inclusion. Expanded
credit registries keeping track of positive as well
as negative episodes in debtors’ histories help
people demonstrate that they are creditworthy.
But regulatory oversight is needed to ensure
transparency and competition in the allocation of funds. The financial crisis of 2008 has
reopened heated debates about the appropriate
level of regulation of the financial sector and the
need to balance prudence and stability with innovation and inclusion.
Access to affordable infrastructure of reasonable quality is, often, another top constraint to
firm growth and job creation. Electricity enables the use of more sophisticated technology.
It also frees up time from domestic chores; in

rural areas, it can significantly increase women’s
employment.14 Telecommunications allows for
better information flows among suppliers, producers, and customers, and the Internet and
mobile technology facilitate the spread of new
ideas. Roads provide greater access to markets,
as do ports and airports.15
In many low-income countries, poor-quality
infrastructure is an especially severe challenge.
Part of the problem stems from how infrastructure services are regulated, however, and not
only from insufficient resources to build additional facilities and roads. By one estimate,
improved infrastructure was responsible for
more than half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s recent
growth.16 But efficiency improvements stemming from better management of spending and
maintenance, pricing policies, and regulations
would be needed to close a significant portion of
the remaining gap in infrastructure services. In
many countries and infrastructure sub-sectors,
monopolies—based on political connections—
have resulted in lower quantities of services being provided, at higher prices and of lower quality than in areas where competition has been
allowed to thrive.17
Regulation is another area that influences
the opportunities for businesses to grow. Some
regulations determine the rules of the game, encouraging—or discouraging—certain activities.
Others affect firms at various stages of their life
cycle, from getting started, to enforcing contracts, to closing down.18 Regulations impact
on the cost of doing business, both in monetary

terms and in time needed to comply. Steps taken
to meet requirements or to pay fees are a burden
to businesses, as are delays in receiving permits
or licenses. The time it takes to comply with
regulations or to receive permits varies greatly
across firms in the same location, suggesting
discretionary power and corruption.19 Beyond
these broader cost measures, regulations affect
the types of opportunities that are available and
how widely they are available. Regulations can
relieve or exacerbate uncertainty and corruption, but they can also have a deeper influence
on the degree of competition and thus the structure of industries in the economy.
Because business regulations affect the degree of competition, they shape the pressures to
innovate and increase productivity. Competition contributes to the reallocation of resources
from inefficient activities to more productive
ones. Regulations that serve to protect an industry or deter new entrants can be particularly
costly in terms of forgone output and employment growth.20 Across countries, regulations
on business entry are inversely correlated with
productivity and firm creation, with stronger
effects in sectors that tend to have higher turnover rates.21 Easing entry requirements helped
increase business registration and employment and drove down prices for consumers in
Mexico. The effect was achieved largely through
creation of new firms rather than formalization
of existing informal firms.22 Combining relaxed
entry requirements with other regulatory reforms, such as investment promotion and trade

logistics, tends to be more effective than simply
easing entry.23

Human capital
Good nutrition, health, and education outcomes
are development goals in themselves, because
they directly improve people’s lives. But they
also equip people for productive employment
and open job opportunities—and through this
employment channel, human capital drives economic and social advances. According to the
Commission on Growth and Development, “every country that sustained high growth for long
periods put substantial efforts into schooling its
citizens and deepening its human capital.”24
Connections between human capital and
jobs are manifold. There is robust evidence
from around the world that each additional year
of schooling raises labor earnings substantially,
and that this earnings premium reflects the
higher productivity of more educated workers.25
Together, nutrition, health, and education form
skills and abilities that have been clearly linked
to productivity growth and poverty reduction
in the medium to longer run.26 Better health
also brings, directly, higher labor productivity.
For example, where malaria is endemic, workers can expect to suffer an average of two bouts
of fever each year, losing 5 to 10 working days
each time.27 In rural Ethiopia, onchocercal skin
disease lowers the earnings of affected workers
by 10 to 15 percent.28 As such, human capital
becomes a fundamental ingredient for desirable
job outcomes.
Human capital formation is cumulative. It is
a life-cycle process that proceeds in consecutive
stages, each of them building on the previous
one. Of crucial importance are adequate health
and nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life,
from inception to two years of age. Brain development in this period affects physical health,
learning abilities, and social behavior throughout life.29 In the early years, a child develops
all the basic brain and physiological structures
upon which later growth and learning depend.
Stunting in early childhood has been proven to
have a significant negative effect on cognitive
development; iodine deficiency can lead to poor
brain development; and insufficient cognitive
stimulation reduces learning abilities. Ensuring adequate nutrition, health, and cognitive

stimulation through a nurturing environment
from the womb through the first years of life
raises significantly the returns to later education investments.30 Supporting young children
born into poverty during these crucial development phases can significantly improve equality of opportunities. The later the support, the
more difficult and costly it is to put that child
back on a normal developmental trajectory. In
Romania, during the early transition years, the
cognitive performance of orphans was lower
the older they were when they left state orphanages. Social, emotional, and cognitive isolation
was common in these facilities.31
While foundations are laid early on, human capital and skills continue to be formed
throughout childhood, young adulthood, and
working life. Schooling is fundamental for the
further development of cognitive and social
skills until the end of adolescence, but learning
abilities continue to be shaped by physical and
mental health. Social skills remain malleable
through adolescence and early adult years.32
Young adults can continue into more specialized skill-building, including at tertiary levels,
but their success depends on whether they have
acquired the generic skills needed to learn and
adapt to different tasks and problem-­solving environments. These abilities are especially important in more dynamic economies.
Unfortunately, the evidence shows that many
countries are falling short in building up the
human capital of their children and youth. The
quality of delivery systems has often failed to
keep pace with the expansion of access to basic
social services. In education, for example, by
2010, the net primary school enrollment rate in
low-income countries had reached 80 percent,
primary school completion was at 68 percent,
and gross lower secondary school enrollment
exceeded 50 percent.33 But learning outcomes
were clearly lagging behind. In a large majority of developing countries that took part in
the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2009, at least 20 percent of
15-year-old students were functionally illiterate.
For a number of countries, including Indonesia,
the Kyrgyz Republic, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Tunisia, and the two Indian states that participated in
the PISA, more than 60 percent of 15-year-old
students failed to reach this level. Similarly, early
reading tests taken at the end of second grade

	

The rule of law and respect for rights
Across countries, the presence of institutions
that uphold the rule of law is associated with
higher levels of development (figure 9.3).35
Clear property rights and institutional mechanisms that strengthen governance can create a
climate in which firms are willing to make investments, enter into contracts, and create new
jobs. In such a climate, individuals may be more
inclined to take the risks needed to set up new
businesses and become entrepreneurs.36
The link between respect for property and development is well established.37 Property rights
foster private sector growth by allowing firms
to invest without fearing that their assets will
be stolen or confiscated. The ability to enforce
contracts widens the circle of potential suppliers
and customers, as personal connections become
less important in establishing trust.38 Entrepreneurs who believe their property rights are
secure reinvest more of their profits than those
who do not.39 Increasing the security of property rights often involves setting up effective
titling and registration processes. Mechanisms
for valuing and protecting other types of property, including legislation governing intellectual
property, are also important.
Rampant crime and violence can be devastating for development and for job creation.40
Lawlessness can drive firms away and discourage
domestic and foreign investment. Across countries, investment climate surveys consistently
find crime and corruption to be obstacles to
conducting business.41 Inclusive and responsive
institutions, which lead to a reduction of violent
behavior, increase safety and security. Strengthening efforts to detect and prosecute white-collar
crime and malfeasance can reduce corruption.
An effective judicial system is a key ingredient for enforcing property rights and reducing
crime and corruption. An independent, accountable, and fair judiciary can contribute to
private sector growth and job creation by en-

forcing the rules that govern transactions and
helping ensure that the costs and benefits of
growth are fairly distributed.42 The justice system can enforce contracts, reduce transaction
costs for firms, and create a safe and more predictable business environment.43 The presence
of effective courts increases the willingness of
firms to invest.44
An institutional environment that respects
rights is another integral part of the rule of law.
The International Labour Organization’s core
labor standards provide guidance on what is unacceptable in the areas of child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and freedom of association
and collective bargaining.45 Health and safety
at work also necessitate attention by governments and employers. Ensuring that standards
are enforced in practice requires providing access to information to workers and employers.
Information can increase the extent to which
workers are able and willing to hold employers and intermediaries accountable. It can also
help ensure that all parties involved are aware of
their obligations. Strengthening institutions for
enforcement and grievance redress is another
necessary building block.

298

Ensuring that rights and standards are upheld requires a focus not only on implementing acquired rights but also on expanding their
reach to workers in jobs that fall outside of formal laws and regulations. Associations of informal workers can play a key role in informing
them, helping them access legal mechanisms,
and offering them collective voice. But often,
information alone is not enough: garment
workers in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic reported that they were told about their basic
conditions of employment, but they did not always understand the details, nor how to enforce
their rights.46 Not only can organizations of
informal workers support workers in learning
about and accessing rights and standards, but
they can also bring cases to court on behalf of
individuals and groups.47
The quality of institutions for accountability
affects the extent to which labor rights are enforced in practice.48 Because court proceedings
are often lengthy and costly, alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes, including conciliation, mediation, and arbitration prior to court
hearings can expand access to justice and grievance redress.49 These alternative mechanisms
are especially valuable to workers who cannot
access the court system due to high costs or
other barriers.

PRIORITIES
LABOR
POLICIES
FUNDAMENTALS

Setting policy priorities for jobs
In addition to ensuring that the fundamentals
are in place and that labor policies are set in a
sensible range, decision makers can help realize the development payoffs that come from
jobs. Some jobs do more than others for living
standards, productivity, and social cohesion.
What those jobs are depends on the country
context—its level of development, demogra-

phy, endowments, and institutions. In some
circumstances, there are no constraints to the
emergence of good jobs for development and
no specific policy is needed. In others, governments can support the private sector in creating
more of these jobs. Sometimes removing existing constraints that impede the creation of jobs
with high development payoffs is possible. In
other cases, policies may need to circumvent the
constraints.
A simple approach to setting policy priorities follows a series of steps. First, the country
context must be assessed and the particular jobs
challenge or challenges it faces must be identified. The second step is examining whether the
jobs with the highest development payoffs are
really the most attractive to individuals or the
most profitable for firms. When incentives are
aligned—with the individual and social value
of jobs equal—there should be no shortage of
good jobs for development and intervention
is not needed. The third step is determining
whether the institutional failures and market
imperfections leading to misaligned incentives
can be pinpointed or not. The fourth step is understanding whether politically feasible reforms
can remove or correct those failures and imperfections. If not, the last step involves assessing
whether incentives should be realigned through
other policies (figure 9.4).
Step one: What are good jobs for development?
­Assessing the development payoffs from jobs
in a particular country context is an important
first step in identifying priorities. The nature of
the jobs with the greatest payoffs varies with the
characteristics of the country, including its phase
of development, endowments, and institutions.
Jobs challenges differ in agrarian economies,
conflict-affected countries, resource-rich countries, and countries with high youth unemployment, as well as in other settings. And the jobs
with the greatest development impact differ as
well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas.
Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A country may or may not face constraints in creating
good jobs for development. For example, light
manufacturing can offer employment opportunities for women, with significant impacts on
reducing poverty. If a boom is under way, the
development payoff of new manufacturing jobs

might materialize. If so, it is difficult to justify
government interventions beyond establishing
the fundamentals and adopting adequate labor
policies.
Misaligned incentives exist when good jobs
for development are not rewarding enough to
individuals or profitable enough to farms and
firms. Data and analysis can be used to identify
gaps between the individual and the social value
of jobs. Arguably, many key areas in development economics deal with these gaps. For instance, the tools of public finance can be applied
to measure the tax burden on capital and labor
and to assess the extent of cross-subsidization
between individuals or firms. Labor economics
methods can be used to uncover gaps between
the actual earnings of specific groups of workers and their potential earnings. Poverty analyses help in identifying the kinds of jobs that are
more likely to provide opportunities to the poor,
or the locations where job creation would have a
greater impact on poverty reduction. Productivity studies can help quantify the spillovers from
employment in FDI companies, in firms connected to global markets, or in functional cities.
Environmental studies shed light on the carbon

footprint and pollution created by various types
of jobs. And analysis of values surveys can discover which types of jobs link to networks and
provide social identity.
Step three: Can the constraints be identified?
Understanding why the individual and social
values of specific types of jobs differ is next.
Gaps of this sort indicate the presence of unexploited spillovers from jobs. The gaps typically
arise from market imperfections and institutional failures that cause people to work in jobs
that are suboptimal from a social point of view,
lead firms to create jobs that are not as good for
development as they could be, or connect people less through jobs than would be socially desirable. But identifying where those constraints
are is not always easy. For instance, a broad set
of cultural, social, and economic forces may
result in insufficient employment opportunities for women. Similarly, it may be difficult to
pinpoint whether the key obstacles to making
cities functional lie in the land market, or in the
institutional arrangements to coordinate urban
development, or in the ability to raise revenue to
finance infrastructure.

Step four: Can the restraints be removed? If the
institutional failures and market imperfections
leading to misaligned incentives can be identified, reforms should be considered. It is a good
economic principle to target reforms to the
failures and imperfections at the root of the
problem. Where reforms are technically and politically feasible, policy makers should directly
tackle the major constraints hindering the creation of more good jobs for development.
Step five: Can the constraints be offset? Reforms
might not be feasible, technically or politically. Or perhaps the constraints for jobs are
not identifiable. An alternative is to enact offsetting policies that can restore the incentives
for job creation. For instance, if a diffuse but
entrenched set of priors and beliefs makes it
difficult for women to work, efforts could aim
at increasing their employability through targeted investments and interventions in social

BOX 9.1 

and physical infrastructure (box 9.1). Similarly, if politically charged regulations slow the
reallocation of labor toward more productive
activities, urban infrastructure and logistics
could enhance the attractiveness of jobs in cities and jobs connected to world markets (question 9). But there are cases when constraints can
neither be removed nor offset. An engagement
strategy involving a deeper analysis of the options and buy-in by key stakeholders is needed
then.
Policy making to remove or offset constraints
has to be selective and supported by good public
finance principles. The costs and benefits of policy options need to be assessed, but the calculations are different when the overall development
impact is the guiding objective. But they are also
more difficult. For instance, an employment
program for ex-combatants in a conflict-affected
country could be assessed in terms of whether
the earnings gains of participants justify the pro-

How does women’s labor force participation increase?

Some developing countries have experienced important increases
in women’s labor force participation over a relatively short period of
time. Nowhere has the change been faster than in Latin America.
Since the 1980s, more than 70 million women have entered the labor
force, raising the women’s labor participation rate from 36 percent
to 43 percent. In Colombia, the rate increased from 47 percent in
1984 to 65 percent in 2006. By contrast, in the Middle East and North
Africa, women’s labor force participation has only grown by 0.17 percentage points per year over the last three decades.
Recent research attributes this rapid transformation to increases
in labor force participation among married or cohabiting women
with children, rather than to demographics, education or business
cycles. Changes in social attitudes contributed to the transformation, but this is a complex area with limited scope—and justification—for direct policy intervention. For instance, women’s participation rates are very low in the West Bank and Gaza, particularly
among married women. But this cannot be mechanically attributed
to religion, as countries like Indonesia have high participation rates.
Other social norms and regulations prevent women from participating, despite their willingness and capacity to do so.
While the scope to influence social attitudes is limited, evidence
suggests that public policies and programs in other areas have an
important role to play. It also suggests that a combination of targeted investments and interventions in social and physical infrastructure can modify women’s labor force participation and the

returns to their earnings. These investments and interventions can
be categorized into three groups. They can address shortages in
the availability of services (such as lack of electricity or daycare
facilities) that force women to allocate large amounts of time to
home production. They can make it easier for women to accumulate productive assets, such as education, capital, and land, facilitating their entry into high-­productivity market activities. And they
can remove norms or regulations that imply biased or even discriminatory practices, preventing women from having equal employment opportunities.
There are successful experiences with targeted investments
and interventions of these three sorts. Public provision or subsidization of child care can reduce the costs women incur at home
when they engage in market work. Examples include Estancias
Infantiles in Mexico, Hogares Comunitarios in Colombia, and similar
programs in Argentina and Brazil. Improvements in infrastructure
services—especially in water and electricity—can free up women’s
time spent on domestic and care work. Electrification in rural South
Africa, for instance, has increased women’s labor force participation by about 9 percent. Correcting biases in service delivery institutions, such as the workings of government land distribution and
registration schemes, allows women to own and inherit assets.
Finally, the use of active labor market policies, the promotion of
networks, and the removal of discriminatory regulations, are
important to make work more rewarding for women.

gram costs. But a full accounting would need to
incorporate the potentially positive effects on
peace building. In the Democratic Republic of
Congo, the cost of a reintegration program for excombatants was about US$800 per beneficiary.50
Such a program would likely be judged as cost
inefficient by traditional standards. Whether or
not it is still worth implementing depends on
the implicit value policy makers attach to its
social cohesion benefits. These spillovers from
jobs may not be measured precisely, but at least
they should be stated, for policy decisions to be
transparent.

Diverse jobs agendas,
diverse policy priorities
Following a protocol to identify constraints to
the creation of good jobs for development, and
then remove or offset them, may sound abstract.
But some countries have successfully done this
in practice, and it is possible to learn directly
from their experiences (box 9.2). The stories of
Vietnam, Rwanda, Chile, and Slovenia, show
that policy can effectively support the creation
of jobs with high development payoffs. Each of
these countries faced a different jobs challenge,
so their policy choices are relevant for other
countries confronted with similar jobs agendas. Getting the fundamentals right by ensuring
macroeconomic stability, improving the business environment, and adhering to the rule of
law, featured prominently in all four cases. All
four countries also embraced labor policies and
institutions within a reasonable range. But it is
telling that the main constraints they targeted
were not in the labor market.

Agrarian economies: Vietnam
Increasing productivity in agriculture, thereby
freeing up labor to work in rural off-farm employment and to eventually migrate to cities, is
the main challenge facing agrarian economies.
At the beginning of its economic reform process, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Vietnam
was a clear illustration of this challenge. In 1993,
the first year for which reliable data exist, over
70 percent of employment was in agriculture,
58 percent of the population lived in poverty,

Beyond labor policies   

and famine was not a distant possibility.51 Two
decades later, Vietnam is the world’s second-­
largest exporter of rice after Thailand; the
second-­largest exporter of coffee after Brazil; the
largest exporter of pepper; and a top exporter
of rubber, cashew nuts, and seafood products.
The poverty rate declined to 16 percent by 2006,
the fastest reduction in poverty ever recorded.
These two decades of accelerated progress took
Vietnam out of the least-developed-country
category and made it a lower-middle-income
economy with upbeat growth prospects.
Vietnam’s transformation from an inefficient agrarian economy into an export powerhouse started with land reform. In the late
1980s and early 1990s, the country abandoned
collectivization by initially allowing local authorities to reallocate communal land to individual households and subsequently extending land-use rights to them. The devolution
of land to rural households was remarkably
egalitarian, especially in the north.52 By 1993,
land-use rights could be legally transferred and
exchanged, mortgaged, and inherited. Land reform was part of a broader package of reforms,
or Doi Moi, which took Vietnam from central
planning to a market economy with a socialist
orientation.53 The package included the gradual
removal of barriers to entry in most sectors, including the commercialization of agricultural
products. Competition brought farmgate prices
much closer to international prices. Combined
with a strong emphasis on agricultural extension, land reform and deregulation led to rapidly growing agricultural productivity on very
small farm plots.
In parallel, policies aimed to create employment opportunities outside agriculture.
Vietnam opened to foreign investors, first in
selected sectors such as natural resource exploitation and light manufacturing, and then
more broadly in the context of its accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007.
Registered FDI increased fourfold in just two
years, from 1992 to 1994; by 2007, FDI inflows
were consistently exceeding 8 percent of GDP.54
Initially investors partnered with state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), because of the complexity
of a legal system still in transition. But SOEs
had gradually been given the flexibility to make
their own business decisions, and many were

There have been successes in tackling jobs challenges around the world

The Republic of Korea effectively used policies to bring out the
agglomeration and integration benefits of an urbanizing country.a
Almost three-quarters of the population was rural in 1960, but by
2000, four-fifths were urban. Seoul, which has grown to more than
10 million people today, was a motor for the country’s overall
growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many
industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital
city. Carefully designed and phased urban development policies
accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light
manufacturing and then to jobs in industries with higher value
added. Land development ­programs were established first, followed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehensive urban planning. Housing and transportation policies held
the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration
of Korea’s urban hubs was a core driver of its growth dynamic.
The country invested massively in skills to support its structural
transfor­mation. The mean years of education of the adult population increased from 4.3 in 1960 to 11.8 in 2010. International test
scores now place Korea at the top of Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, mathematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.
Small island nations are characterized by their size, isolation, and
exposure to climatic risks. In these circumstances, reaping the productivity gains from agglomeration and global integration is especially challenging. Tonga is using migration as an active instrument
to connect to the world economy.b Approximately 100,000 Tongans
live abroad, almost as many as at home. Remittances account for an
estimated 32 percent of GDP and reach 80 percent of households,
raising the education levels and productive investments. Migration
agreements also reach poorer and less-skilled workers. In 2007, New
Zealand launched the Recognized Seasonal Employer (RSE) program, which provides temporary opportunities for seasonal workers
from the Pacific to work in horticulture and viticulture. For the households of participants, the program has led to income gains of up
to 38 percent, more purchases of durable goods, and a broader
improvement in well-being. In addition to income, RSE workers
brought home their newly acquired knowledge of agricultural techniques, computer literacy, and English-language skills.
Formalizing countries can envision increasing the coverage of
their social protection systems to levels typical of industrial countries. But costs are high, as is the risk of distoring incentives and
undermining productivity. Brazil is one country that has been able
to not only grow quickly but expand the formal sector in the

process.c Benefiting from a booming global commodities market
and a competitive exchange rate, its economy was growing at
around 5 percent a year before the 2008 financial crisis. But unlike
other rapidly growing countries, Brazil’s job creation in the formal
sector was three times as high as in the informal sector. Just in the
five years leading up to the crisis, the formal share of total employment increased by about 5 percentage points. In some ways, Brazil
is an unlikely “formalizer”—it has a heavily regulated business sector and a costly labor system. Although its rapid formalization is too
recent to be fully explained yet, it appears efforts to simplify and
extend the reach of programs and regulations have been contributing factors. The government has expanded the coverage of its
social protection system through noncontributory programs. It has
also simplified tax rules for small businesses, increased incentives
for firms to formalize their workers, and improved enforcement of
tax and labor regulations.
In aging societies the increase in the old-age dependency ratio
reduces the average productivity per person, while the growing costs
of caring for the elderly undermine living standards. But the reforms
needed to address these challenges are politically difficult to implement and often involve hard tradeoffs. Poland is an example of a
country that has taken several successful steps.d By the turn of the
century, labor force participation rates were declining due to the
growing incidence of early retirement and disability pensions. But
several reforms that reduced the inflows of new beneficiaries led to
an increase in the employment-to-­population ratio from 60 percent
in 2006 to 65 percent in 2009. Changes in the application of eligibility
rules of disability pensions, enacted in 2005, sharply reduced the
intake of new beneficiaries. In 2009, a pension reform tackled early
retirement options. This reform is such that old-age pension benefits
adjust downward as life expectancy increases. Hence, the country is
expected to have a fiscally sustainable pension system in the long
run. That sustainability came at a cost: benefits as a percentage of
earnings at retirement became significantly lower than the average in
the European Union. In 2012, a new wave of pension reforms raised
the retirement age to 67 for men and women from the current 65 for
men and 60 for women. This increase should help to raise the benefit
level without adversely affecting fiscal sustainability. Policies and programs to ease labor market entry for the inactive and unemployed of
all ages remain modest, however, and their impact still needs to be
determined. Also, long-term health care continues to rely largely on
informal arrangements, but reforms are now publicly debated.

totally or partially sold to private investors. By
the turn of the century, greenfield FDI investments had become the norm, especially in sectors such as garments, footwear, appliances,
and consumer electronics.55 Firms in these sectors are employing workers in large numbers.
Important challenges remain, but Vietnam is

by now a rapidly urbanizing economy, which is
a testimony to its success.

Conflict-affected countries: Rwanda
Rwanda today seems far removed from the war
and genocide of the mid-1990s, and jobs contrib-

	

uted to such a remarkable turnaround. The conflict has had a severe impact on society and the
economy, with massive loss of life, destruction of
infrastructure, a crisis of state institutions, and
a drop in GDP that exceeded 50 percent.56 The
cessation of conflict and an aggressive package of
reforms allowed Rwanda’s economy to rebound
to pre-crisis levels by 2000.57 Growth has continued, reaching an estimated 8.8 percent in 2011,
and the poverty rate fell by 12 percentage points
between 2005 and 2010.58
A precondition for sustainable job creation
in countries emerging from conflict is securing
peace and reducing risks of recurring violence.59
In the wake of the conflict, the Rwandan government supported the reintegration and demobilization of more than 54,000 former combatants. Ex-combatants received a combination of
cash assistance, counseling, vocational training,
education, support for income-generating activities, and social reintegration activities involving community members.60 More than a decade
after the end of conflict, most former combatants were participating in vocational training or
working, mainly in subsistence agriculture and
self-employment, similar to the rest of Rwanda’s
population.61 Although many ex-combatants
continued to experience social and psychological
hardships, their relations with their neighbors
were reportedly good, and trust was improving.
In 2012, 73 percent of ex-combatants expressed
satisfaction with their social integration, and 85
percent of community members felt that there
was trust between the two groups.62
While the number of ex-combatants only
represents a small share of Rwanda’s total population of 10 million, reintegration through jobs
had social cohesion payoffs, which established a
basis for the country to move forward. Rwanda
has built on this start by rejuvenating the private
sector through reforms to institutions and business regulations.63 A good example of the government’s private sector development strategy
was its decision to revitalize its coffee industry
through deregulation and investments in new
technology, a decision that has led to new job
creation.64 Rwanda still faces serious jobs challenges. More than 80 percent of the population
works in subsistence agriculture and household enterprises, where productivity needs to
be improved. Also, opportunities for off-farm

basis for future progress.66

Resource-rich countries: Chile
While many countries rich in resources seem
unable to diversify and are beset by poor governance, Chile’s savvy management of its copper riches makes it a notable exception. In 2010,
Chile was home to 28 percent of the world’s
copper reserves and about one-third of world
copper production; for the past two decades,
it has accounted for 17 percent of world copper exports.67 But despite the prominence of
copper in its economy, Chile has been able to
­diversify its exports and its economy while effectively managing resource-related risks such
as currency appreciation and macroeconomic
turbulence. Nonmineral exports increased significantly as a share of total exports after the
1980s, before retreating somewhat during the
global commodities boom after 2007 (figure
9.5). Employment in the nonmining sectors
has grown strongly at more than 2 percent annually over the past two decades.68 The unemployment rate has averaged around 8 percent
over the past decade, a far cry from the record
20 percent of the early 1980s.69
A set of macroeconomic, institutional, export-diversification, and skill-building policies
contributed to this broad-based job creation
path. Chile combines the use of a resource stabilization mechanism (since 1987, with the
current framework adopted in 2006) with a
transparent fiscal rule (since 1999) that jointly
regulate how copper extraction rents are used.70
A structural surplus target is the anchor for determining inflows and outflows into two funds,
one for pensions and other long-term government liabilities, the other for short-term stabilization purposes. The funds are authorized
to invest their portfolio fully abroad, relieving
pressures on the exchange rate.71 In parallel,
governance reforms over the past decades in all
areas of public sector management have led to
significant success: Chile climbed 5 percentiles
in its voice and accountability rating between
1996 and 2009 and also improved its political
stability and control of corruption ratings.72
Further, Chile adopted an active exportoriented growth policy, opening up to trade
and welcoming direct foreign investment,

thereby enhancing the productivity spillovers
from global integration. An ambitious innovation strategy to raise competitiveness was
developed.73 Public funds were used specifically to boost education expenditures, which
almost doubled in real terms between 1990
and 2009.74 While quality as well as equity in
the education system are much debated today,
the share of low-skilled workers declined in all
economic sectors.75

Countries with high youth unemployment:
Slovenia
Slovenia has made inroads into the problem
of high youth unemployment (figure 9.6).
Throughout the first decade after the breakup of
the former Yugoslavia, young people were three
times as likely as adults to be unemployed. By
2010, this ratio had fallen to two to one.76 The
youth employment rate, which was 10 percentage points above the European Union (EU)
aver­age in 2000, was lower than the EU ­average
in 2010.77 By then, the share of Slovenia’s youth
not in education, employment, or training was
just 7.5 percent among the 15- to 24-year age
group, well below the EU average of 11.2 percent.78 While the crisis has certainly been felt by

young people, European Commission President
José Manuel Barroso recently highlighted Slovenia as an example of best practice in the employment of youth.79
Slovenia’s relative success in reducing youth
unemployment does not strictly follow traditional recipes. Its spending on active labor market policies is about average for transition countries. Although some reforms have been made to
liberalize the rules for contract and temporary
work, Slovenia’s labor regulations remain more
restrictive than the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) aver­
age, a policy stance that is usually associated
with reduced job opportunities for young people. Minimum wages—also frequently cited as a
barrier for youth employment—are on the high
side. But potential distortions from these policies seem to be somewhat offset by a model of
consensus-based decision making. In Slovenia,
trade unions and employers’ organizations, both
with broad coverage, set wages that respond well
to macroeconomic trends and sectoral productivity patterns.80
Sustained growth supported by increased
competition in product markets, is ultimately
responsible for much of Slovenia’s decrease
in youth unemployment. Taking advantage of

European integration, the economy successfully
restructured its export sector to access EU markets. Very good infrastructure and a fairly skilled
workforce helped as well. This dynamism, requiring the use of more advanced production
and management techniques in modern sectors, was especially well-suited for youth. While
the story is a good one in many ways, further
policy reforms could help Slovenia realize more
of the development payoffs that flow from jobs
for young people. Some of these reforms are in
the labor market, such as removing the incentives created by employment protection laws
that tilt job creation for youth toward contract
and temporary work. But others are outside the
labor market, such as introducing measures to
encourage more FDI.81

Policies for jobs in one country can have spillovers on other countries, both positive and
negative. An important issue is whether international coordination mechanisms could influence the decisions that governments make,
enhancing the positive spillovers and mitigating the negative ones. Several areas lend themselves to coordination. Promoting compliance
with rights and labor standards, a global public
good, is the most obvious one, but the effectiveness of the mechanisms for doing so is limited.
Measures to facilitate FDI flows, especially in
services, would have substantial effects on productivity in developing countries but they may
also have social implications. Migration has impacts on both sending and recipient countries,
suggesting that bilateral agreements could lead
to better outcomes for both parties.

Rights and standards: Pressure goes only
so far
Several mechanisms operating across borders
exist to set standards and provide channels
for improving workers’ rights and their working conditions. They include the issuance and
ratification of ILO conventions, bilateral and
multilateral trade agreements, and initiatives involving the private sector, civil society, and other
stakeholders. These mechanisms operate either

through peer pressure or by providing positive
incentives for governments and firms to comply.
But it is not certain that these kinds of pressures
and incentives actually change working conditions on the ground, and the risk that improvements come at the expense of job creation cannot be ruled out.
ILO conventions provide a framework for
rights, standards, and conditions at work. At
the country level, conventions can influence
domestic legislation if countries do align their
laws with global standards. They can be a channel for voice and coordination internationally,
as demonstrated by the adoption of conventions for home-based and domestic workers.82
Evidence from the ratification of the eight conventions included in the ILO’s 1998 Declaration
on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work
(the core labor standards) suggests that countries respond to pressure from the international
community.83 Yet, the persistence of forced labor, children working in hazardous conditions,
discrimination, and lack of voice also suggests
that ratification on its own is not sufficient.

306  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

Trade agreements have also been used with
the intent of supporting workers rights. Some of
them incorporate incentives to improve working conditions and access to voice. For instance,
the 1999 bilateral trade agreement between
Cam­bodia and the United States included provisions to increase Cambodia’s quota for garment imports into the United States market if
regular reviews showed improvements in working conditions.
Whether labor clauses actually lead to better
outcomes for workers on either side of a trade
agreement is the subject of a running debate.
Skeptics point out that the agreements, on their
own, can be weak instruments for improving
rights and working conditions and cannot substitute for adequate enforcement of domestic labor laws.84 There are also concerns about political capture and pressures from interest groups
and uneven bargaining power between treaty
parties.85 Labor clauses could be used as a protectionist tool, undermining trade and employment opportunities in developing countries.
Supporters claim that labor clauses in trade
agreements not only improve the enforcement
of existing labor and employment standards
but also lead to increased FDI to developing
countries, thus benefiting workers in developing
countries in both direct and indirect ways.86
Linking rights to trade agreements may have
an impact on working conditions if complemented by investments in capacity for enforcement and compliance at the country level. After it signed the Central America Free Trade
Agreement, the Dominican Republic increased
the number of labor inspectors and invested
in capacity building.87 And after it entered the
bilateral trade agreement with Cambodia, the
United States funded two ILO projects there.
One of them, Better Factories Cambodia, involved building capacity for compliance and
monitoring of working conditions in garment
factories. The other supported an arbitration
council to resolve collective labor disputes.88
Subsequent reviews have found improvements
in working conditions and collective rights.89
Beyond the initiatives of governments
through conventions and trade agreements,
there has been a growing emphasis on private sector accountability. Under the broader
corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda,
companies voluntarily assume social and en-

vironmental concerns into their operations.90
While some develop their own codes of conduct, collective initiatives are increasingly important for improving working conditions
in global supply chains. Shared codes enable
companies to collaborate with other businesses
in ­
industry-led platforms, and with trade
unions and nongovernmental organizations in
multistakeholder initiatives (sometimes with
government observers).91
Almost all such initiatives have defined standards of practice, but they differ substantially in
their governance structures, in their procedures
for implementation, monitoring, and verification, and in whether they involve certification
and labeling.92 CSR initiatives focused on labor
issues are generally concentrated in sectors relying on global supply chains that are exposed to
reputational risk, such as garments, sportswear,
food and, increasingly, electronics.93 Codes of
conduct are most frequently adopted by companies based in the European Union and North
America, which then make compliance with
labor standards a condition for doing business
with them. A small number of voluntary initiatives have also emerged in developing countries,
although these are generally a response to external pressure more than a reaction to campaigning by local consumers.94
There is limited evidence to demonstrate
how far CSR initiatives go beyond good intentions to result in tangible and sustainable improvements in rights and working conditions.
The clearest impacts are found in the area of
health and safety and, to a lesser extent, in regularization of working hours. Improvements on
freedom of association and discrimination are
much less likely. Overall, the benefits are more
pronounced for permanent workers than for
migrants, agency workers, and seasonal and
temporary workers.95 Codes do not operate in
a vacuum, so the capacity of local actors and
the quality of domestic laws and institutions are
critical to the effectiveness of the efforts.96
These findings stress the need for approaches
to improving working conditions that extend
to sectoral and national-level engagement with
governments, employers, trade unions, and civil
society organizations. Voluntary labor initiatives
cannot substitute for domestic efforts to set up
adequate legal protections and put in place institutions to support compliance and provide av-

Improving business practices facilitates compliance with labor standards

The Better Work program seeks to improve compliance with international labor standards and national laws, while promoting business competitiveness. The program operates through partnerships
with governments, employer and worker organizations, and international buyers. It currently includes global garment brands and
retailers with supply chains outsourcing production to Cambodia,
Haiti, Indonesia, Jordan, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and Vietnam.
The program involves thorough workplace assessments that
examine compliance with international labor standards and
national labor law, as well as advisory services to help employers
and workers jointly create and implement improvement plans. Tailored training services support workplace cooperation and address
specific issues, such as supervisory skills, human resource systems,
and occupational safety and health. The program undertakes public
reporting, which presents aggregate noncompliance data from all
participating factories in a country and allows comparisons across
countries according to specific indicators. A Better Work global
team ensures quality, consistency, and effective knowledge man-

agement, supporting country teams with tools for advisory services,
monitoring and evaluation, and impact assessment.
Better Work is modeled on the Better Factories Cambodia program, which was introduced in conjunction with the bilateral trade
agreement between Cambodia and the United States. Results of
evaluations of Better Factories Cambodia, covering more than 90
percent of participating factories, found that compliance on occupational safety and health improved 20 percent. Correct payment of
wages, overtime, and benefits increased 37 percent. Initially, incentives to improve working conditions were driven by the quota
increases called for under the trade agreement; however, with the
expiration of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), quota increases
were no longer possible. Nevertheless, the Cambodian garment
industry has continued to invest in monitoring, having identified
labor compliance as an important part of its claim to a niche in
the global garment industry. This niche exists despite the expiration
of the MFA largely because of the role that reputation plays in the
supply chain.

enues for redress. The public and private sectors
can work together, as in Brazil, where in 2003
the Ministry of Labor began publishing lists of
companies found to be using forced labor. The
increased public awareness led companies to
subscribe to a National Pact to Combat Slave
Labor, with civil society organizations establishing a committee to monitor the pact.97
While most jobs in developing countries
fall outside the scope of CSR initiatives, these
efforts have the potential for a wider influence
if they can be expanded to include workers,
mainly women, who do not have formal contracts. At the same time, local governance and
institutions could be boosted through activities
to strengthen the capacity of actors and institutions and improve processes of dialogue and
cooperation. Demonstration effects may also
occur at the country level if CSR efforts increase
the visibility of activities to improve rights and
working conditions, and if labor inspectorates
and third-party monitoring bodies gain experience and capacity. The potential benefits of
local capacity building are illustrated by the experience of Better Work, a partnership program
between the ILO and the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) aimed at improving compli-

ance with labor standards in the garment sector
(box 9.3).98

Further liberalizing trade, but managing
the tradeoffs
International trade in goods has been gradually liberalized, and the notion that freer trade
is mutually beneficial for the transacting parties is now widely shared. Various mechanisms
have been used in the liberalization process,
including multilateral, regional, and bilateral
agreements, as well as unilateral commitments.
At the multilateral level, liberalization has been
achieved through negotiations under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) first, and then of its successor,
the WTO. The most recent round of multilateral
negotiations, the Doha Development Agenda,
aims for better market access for the exporting industries of developing countries. Average
bound tariffs would fall from 40 to 30 percent
for agricultural products, and from 10 to 5 percent for manufactures. Actual tariffs could fall
by 11 to 14 percentage points for the former, and
by 2 to 3 percentage points for the latter. Cuts
could be much sharper in sectors such as tex-

307

308  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

tiles and clothing. The least-developed countries
could even benefit from duty-free quota access
on almost all of their exports to industrial countries.99 For developing countries, the success of
the Doha Round could therefore have a substantive impact on the creation of jobs connected to
global value chains, which are typically good
jobs for development. But the Doha negotiations are in limbo.
Despite the progress in trade liberalization,
many developing countries still lack the competitiveness to harness the benefits from global
integration. Providing them with direct assistance to reduce logistics costs and improve
the competitiveness of firms and farms is thus
a priority. The Aid for Trade initiative aims to
increase aid to developing countries so that they
can tap existing market opportunities. Aid for
Trade has increased substantially and now accounts for about a third of total aid to developing countries. To date, most of the resources
have been channeled to infrastructure investments and trade facilitation. But the assistance
could be made more effective by focusing on the
export activities most suited to addressing the
specific jobs challenges facing recipient countries. Increasing the involvement of the private
sector would also enhance the effectiveness of
the assistance provided.100
In contrast to trade in goods, services liberalization has made slow progress, at both the
multi­lateral and the regional levels. Services are
subject to more pervasive regulations, because
they are characterized by well-known market
imperfections. These range from natural monopolies in the distribution of electricity to network externalities in telecommunications, and
from asymmetric information and moral hazard
in finance to market power in retail trade. While
the liberalization of trade in goods is ­associated
with domestic liberalization, the liberalization
of trade in services usually requires domestic
regulation. Setting up markets for electricity, ensuring universal service in telecommunications,
adopting appropriate banking supervision, and
managing the social impacts of large distributors on retail trade are challenging tasks.101
Not surprisingly, liberalization in services
is much less advanced in developing countries
than in industrial countries. The former are
also reluctant to make additional commitments.
Neither existing agreements under General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) nor

proposals in the Doha agenda and in regional
trade discussions offer prospects for significant
liberalization (figure 9.7). 102
However, the productivity gains from services liberalization would be substantial. Electricity, finance, telecommunications, and trade
have a direct impact on production and transaction costs, making downstream sectors more
competitive. By boosting job creation and raising labor earnings, these productivity gains
should also lead to improved living standards.
Social impacts can be more mixed. They are
clearly positive when cell phones connect people
(especially the poor) to markets for their products, to employment opportunities, or to government services. They can be negative when
the disappearance of retail trade leads to the
decline of traditional urban areas and affects the
livelihoods of older shopkeepers who may not
find alternative employment easily.
An adequate sequencing of services liberalization and domestic regulation can help manage these tradeoffs and, in doing so, address the
concerns of developing countries. For instance,
in telecommunications, enhanced domestic
competition improves welfare more than handing over existing providers to better-performing
foreign operators. Evidence from 86 developing
countries between 1985 and 1999 suggests that
both competition and liberalization can independently improve performance. But penetration of telecommunications services, measured
by main-line access, is lower if competition is
introduced after liberalization, rather than at
the same time.103
A careful design of liberalization, can also
cushion social impacts. For instance, in its preferential trade agreement with the United States,
Oman chose a sequential approach for the liberalization of its retail trade. Foreign nationals
were initially permitted to own up to 100 percent of the equity in established retail enterprises valued at more than US$5 million, with
the threshold subsequently declining to US$1
million. This agreement allowed for gradual
adjustment. At the same time, it was generous in relation to foreign ownership, which is
restricted to 49 percent in Oman’s prevailing
multilateral agreements.104 Similarly, concerns
about the impact of liberalization on urban
centers are addressed through land-zoning restrictions, as some industrial countries do. But
these restrictions can also be used as entry de-

terrents, reducing competition and undermining job creation.105
The limited traction in services liberalization
is due largely to the potential tradeoffs involved.
Developing countries may lack knowledge on
the gains from opening markets, the on preconditions for realizing such gains in light of existing
tradeoffs, and on the policy options available for
maximizing the gains and handling the trade­
offs. Similar to the case of trade in goods, many
countries also lack the ability to implement policies and agreements. International collaboration is thus needed to address such knowledge
gaps and facilitate implementation.106
International agreements can also be used to
promote global public goods. One case in point
is gender equality. Trade is not gender neutral. Its
liberalization, including services trade, changes
women’s access to jobs. Traditionally men were
more likely to have “brawn jobs,” involving
stronger physical requirements. But “brain jobs”
involving dexterity, attention, or communication—from stitching garments to processing
data—present more opportunities for women.
In Delhi and Mumbai, call centers employ more

than 1 million people, most of them women.
Preferential access for developing country imports from sectors with more “brain jobs” can
thus be used to create employment opportunities for women in countries where gender
equality is far from being attained.107 However,
as countries move up the ladder of global value
chains, women may also lose job opportunities.
This was the case in Malaysia, where the share of
women working in manufacturing declined in
the mid-1980s.108

Migration policies: Toward bilateral
agreements
Movements of people across borders have elicited diverse policy reactions by recipient countries over the course of history. These have included physical walls that keep foreigners away,
policies preventing forced and bonded labor
across oceans, and policies of open migration.
In addition, there has been a range of specific
measures including amnesties for irregular migrants, statutes controlling entry by refugees,
and complex systems for granting visas. In most

310  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

cases, these policies have been introduced unilaterally by the recipient country and have involved little or no international dialogue or cooperation with sending countries.
In contrast to the movement of goods and
services across borders, few international agreements concern migration in general and migration of workers in particular. Those in existence
have limited coverage. ILO Conventions 97 and
143, in force since 1952 and 1978, respectively,
seek to protect migrants from discrimination
and abuse, and call for penalties and sanctions
against those who promote clandestine or illegal migration. But these conventions have been
ratified by only 49 and 23 countries, respectively.
Mode 4 of GATS covers exports of services conducted through individuals present in another
WTO member country.109 It entered into force
in 1995 and covers all signatories to the WTO,
but only a limited number of services have been
liberalized by either developed or developing
countries, with very few moving ahead in sensitive areas like health services. Finally, the United
Nations International Convention on the rights
of all migrant workers and members of their
families aims to “contribute to the harmonization of the attitudes of States through the acceptance of basic principles concerning the treatment of migrant workers and members of their
families.” This convention entered into force in
2003 but has been ratified by only 22 countries,
mostly sending countries.
Growing differences in ages, incomes, skills
and economic perspectives between countries
are likely to create mounting pressures for migration. Despite the interest of both industrial
and developing countries in “talent” migration, low-skill migrants will still account for
the bulk of cross-border flows in the years to
come.110 But readiness to make the most of
these growing differences between countries,
and manage migration in a mutually beneficial
way, is limited. Multicountry agreements have
been slow to develop. Bilateral agreements that
take into consideration geographical and historical trends, protect basic rights of workers,
and take into account the social impacts of migration, could benefit both host and sending
countries.
Migration is an area where a global perspective is warranted, but views on what needs to
be done are quite diverse. One view focuses on

the large earnings differentials between countries, suggesting that the free movement of labor would accelerate global productivity growth
and poverty reduction enormously.111 Another
perspective focuses on national security and
the protection of communities and their cultures, implying the need for barriers to contain
migration. Yet another highlights the moral
­
imperative to protect the human rights of migrants, no matter their legal status, and to give
shelter to those who suffer any form of persecution.112 None of these views suffices, because
none of them alone can address the complex
tradeoffs that migration poses for policy design.
There are many examples of such tradeoffs.
The more that is spent in protecting the welfare
of migrants, which sending countries and concerned citizens everywhere demand, the more
expensive the use of migrant labor will become,
and the fewer the number of workers who will
be hired. The more that is done to assimilate
and integrate the migrants, which some host-­
country groups favor, the less likely migrants
will be to return to their home countries. The
more active the policies to attract “talent” migrants, the greater the “brain drain” concerns
among sending countries. The higher the protection of sectors such as agriculture by industrial countries, the more likely are migrants
from developing countries to work in those
sectors. Conditioning foreign aid on banning
migration seems unacceptable and would affect
fundamental rights of workers by constraining
their freedom to move. Stern visa restrictions
and deportations usually backfire and may turn
overstayers into irregular migrants. These examples indicate that unilateral policies cannot address all these dilemmas. However, the adoption
of global agreements setting the conditions of
migration and superseding country legislation,
seems unlikely. This is why an intermediate solution can be more effective.
In many instances, both sending and host
countries can benefit from migration through
a collaborative approach. Most abuses perpetrated by traffickers, firms, or workers are associated with illegal migrant flows. The formalization of these flows is a basic tool for
protecting the rights of migrant workers, while
at the same time having them honor the terms
under which they were welcomed. This formalization, however, is difficult to enforce without

	

the cooperation of institutions in both sending
and receiving countries.113 Bilateral agreements
can include provisions regarding quotas by occupation, industry, region, and duration of stay.
They can distinguish between temporary movements of workers and steps to permanent migration, with conditions and protocols for moving from one country to another and regulation
of recruitment agencies and intermediaries.
They can include considerations about taxation
and social security, including on benefits to be
provided, portability of contributions, and costsharing arrangements. These agreements can
design incentives so that firms, worker associations, and governments in both sending and receiving countries have an interest in enforcing
the provisions.114
Formalizing and extending temporary migration agreements could capture part of the
wage gain from migration that is currently absorbed by intermediaries, to the benefit of both
migrants and their employers. Agreements in
the financial sector could lower the cost of remittances to migrants and avoid the prevalence
of illegal transactions. Reconsidering the financing of higher education in both developing and
developed countries could favor a more balanced sharing of the returns to investments in
the case of talent migrants. More generally, bilateral coordination is a sensible way to manage
migration and ensure mutual benefits for sending and recipient countries.

Jobs are center stage, but where are
the numbers?
Policies for jobs need to be based on reliable data
and rigorous analysis.115 Given that a large share
of the people at work in developing countries are
not wage employees, and that even a larger share
lacks social security coverage, the measurement
of employment must look beyond whatever formal employment data the country gathers. Determining which jobs have the greatest payoffs
for poverty reduction requires linking information on a household’s income or consumption
with information on the employment of its
members. Understanding which firms create
more jobs, or whether labor reallocation leads to
substantial growth rather than just churning, requires information on the inputs and outputs of

Beyond labor policies   

very diverse production units, including microenterprises. Assessing whether employment experiences affect trust and willingness to engage
in society requires information on individual
values and behaviors. Such information is necessary to tackle an emerging research agenda on
jobs and development (box 9.4).
However, the paucity of empirical analyses
on the employment impact of the global crisis
in developing countries and the difficulty of
comparing measures of informal employment
across countries suggest that data quality and
availability are limited. Much effort goes into
measuring unemployment rates, even with a
relatively high frequency.116 But open unemployment is not a very telling indicator in countries where an important fraction of the labor
force is not salaried. Four indicators are listed to
monitor progress toward the employment target under the Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) on eradicating poverty. This target calls
for “achieving full and productive employment
and decent work for all, including women and
young people.” But the four indicators considered only partially capture advances in the
quantity and quality of jobs in the developing
world.117 Many available employment figures
are actually inferred through interpolation between years and extrapolation using data from
“similar” countries, but how reliable these
methods are remains an open question.
These remarks are not meant to criticize
statistical agencies at the country level or data
collection efforts at the international level. Their
efforts are filling important gaps and mobilizing
expertise to improve definitions, reach agreements on best practices, and provide technical
assistance to those generating primary data.118
Despite the limitations, data on informal employment, the unemployment rate, or the MDG
employment target serve an important objective, namely, increasing awareness on the importance of jobs for promoting development.
However, moving jobs center stage could remain an aspirational statement in the absence
of a sustained effort to improve the amount and
comparability of data.
Today’s challenges regarding labor statistics
can be regrouped into three key areas: data gaps;
data quality issues; and planning, coordination,
and communication issues. In some countries,
labor statistics do not exist at all or are collected

Knowledge gaps on jobs and development chart the research agenda

Increased reliance on disaggregated survey data, together with rigorous program evaluation and controlled experiments, has pushed
the knowledge frontier on jobs and development in recent years.
On almost all relevant issues a substantive body of evidence already
exists. Current efforts of the research community promise its expansion in the coming years, in ways that should contribute to better
informed policy making. However, knowledge gaps remain in several areas.
Jobs and living standards. An abundance of high-quality work
has been done on the measurement of poverty and the assessment
of poverty alleviation programs. Less is known on how employment
dynamics affect household living standards and movements in and
out of poverty. Research on transitions between different employment statuses, occupations, industries, and types of jobs can shed
light on incentives to work and formalize, as well as on impacts of
jobs on household well-being. Knowledge is also limited on the
subjective value workers attach to various characteristics of their
jobs, including to social security benefits such as old-age and disability pensions.
Jobs and productivity. Many studies are available on firm dynamics, including births, growth, and deaths. There is also a growing literature on the impacts of trade liberalization and foreign direct
investment on productivity and earnings at the plant level. Much of
this research focuses on formal sector firms, however. Much less

plant-level surveys and the growing literature on the effects of

urbanization. The dialogue between these different literatures is in
part hampered by different visions of production processes on
issues such as returns to scale or externalities.
Jobs and social cohesion. Research in this area is tentative and the
empirical evidence is scarce. The importance of the topic and the
paucity of robust results mean that the payoffs to high-quality
research in this area could be very high. Natural experiments combined with longitudinal data spanning relatively long periods of

time may shed light on the links between jobs and behaviors. Interdisciplinary research could provide insights on the broader relationship between jobs and institutional development processes.
Anthropological approaches may provide insights on the mechanisms at play; for instance on how jobs affect perceptions on fairness and the willingness to trust others.
Spillovers from jobs. Research on the magnitude of spillovers
from jobs is patchy. The agenda is long, but a promising area concerns the impact of jobs on the acquisition of cognitive and noncognitive skills, and how this impact varies depending on the characteristics of the job and those of the person who holds it. Evidence on
agglomeration effects across cities with different characteristics is
also scarce, as are estimates of the environmental impacts of different types of jobs.
Labor policies. A growing number of empirical studies focus on
the impact of labor policies and institutions, and many of these
studies are very rigorous. However, a careful review suggests that
the relationship between policies and institutions on the one hand,
and outcomes on the other, is not linear. Rather, it evokes a “plateau”
of modest effects, but with “cliffs” at both ends where the impacts
on efficiency and the distribution of jobs can be sizeable. Empirical
work to determine where these cliffs lie and how to identify the
institutional characteristics that demarcate the limits of the plateau
would be of much value for policy makers.
Connected jobs agendas. More research is needed on how international trade, investment at both ends, and migration affect the
composition of employment across countries. Knowledge gaps are
common in all of these areas. The ability of national policies and
supranational mechanisms such as trade agreements to affect jobs
in different countries is only partially understood. More solid knowledge on the right sequencing of international commitments and
domestic policies related to services could address the reluctance of
developing countries to make further progress in the direction of
liberalization. Rigorous evaluations of migration policies would also
be helpful.

only sporadically. Where labor statistics do
exist, data quality is a concern throughout the
statistical production chain, from the use of appropriate definitions to questionnaire design,
from sampling frames to interviewing protocols,
and from data entry and coding to verification
and estimation procedures. Planning, coordination, and communication issues are exacerbated
when different institutions are responsible for
collecting and disseminating the data.119 The
most urgent priorities are to standardize the
employment modules attached to the household surveys used for poverty analysis, and to

ensure that establishment surveys include informal firms and microenterprises.
A quarter of a century ago, a renewed emphasis on poverty reduction as the key objective of
development policy launched a long-term data
effort. Across the world, information on household living standards was collected through
standardized surveys, the sampling methods
and the variable definitions used were duly documented, and the data and documentation were
made available to researchers and practitioners
whenever possible. A similar approach should
be envisioned to move jobs center stage.

How to accelerate labor reallocation?

Creative destruction, the mainstay of economic
growth, happens to a large extent through labor reallocation. As workers move from jobs
in low-productivity farms and obsolete firms
to jobs in more dynamic economic units, output increases and the economy moves closer
to the efficiency frontier. Differences in productivity across economic units underlie this
creative destruction process. Such differences
can reflect a healthy ecosystem driven by competition which offers the basis for efficiencyenhancing job reallocation. Market imperfections and government failures may hinder labor
reallocation, however, resulting in a wider dispersion of productivity and many missed opportunities for growth.120
Stringent regulations that obstruct the movement of workers from low- to high-productivity
areas or that prevent their separation from obsolete firms are a case in point. These regulations may stem from good intentions, such as
containing congestion in cities or providing
earnings stability to workers. But their cost in
productivity growth can be substantial. Regulations of this kind do not sit on the efficiency
“plateau” where labor policies are mainly redistributive; they are rather on the cliff, and have
unambiguously negative effects on economic
efficiency.
India is arguably an example of a country
whose complex and cumbersome labor policies
have pushed it off the “plateau.” The country has
more than 40 national and state-level labor laws.
Most of them apply to the organized (or formal)
sector and to firms above a certain size. As firms’
employment increases, they fall under the purview of a growing number of regulations.121 The
Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) of 1947 is particularly restrictive. Governing employee-employer
relationships, the IDA makes it extremely difficult for firms to terminate employment.122
The stringency of labor regulations is consistent with the “missing middle” phenomenon,
characteristic of India and other developing
countries, where medium-size businesses make
up a disproportionately small share of the total. Also consistent with the stringency of labor regulations is the substantial dispersion of

productivity. If the dispersion observed within
each industry narrowed to the point of matching the dispersion observed in the United States,
India’s average productivity in manufacturing
could increase by more than half.123 Instead, despite India’s buoyant economic growth during
the past two decades, the performance of the
labor-intensive manufacturing sector has been
sluggish.124 The bulk of the growth in nonfarm
employment has been in the informal sector.
The conventional wisdom, when a country
is riddled with misguided labor regulations, is
to repeal them. This repeal may be easier said
than done, however. India’s complex labor regulatory system has been in place for 60 years;
even the ambitious reform program triggered
by the balance-of-payment crisis of 1991 left
­labor regulations largely untouched.125 The IDA
of 1947 has been amended at the state level but
not always toward the plateau. Between 1958
and 1992, seven states amended the IDA to give
employers more latitude in labor decisions.
These states subsequently experienced higher
growth in output, employment, investment,
and productivity in their formal manufacturing sector. But six other states changed the IDA
in the opposite direction, which resulted in a
worsening in firm performance and an expansion of the informal sector.126 Overall, the dispersion of productivity in India’s manufacturing sector remained stable, or even increased,
between 1987 and 1994.127

From bypassing regulatory obstacles . . .
India’s response to these regulatory obstacles has
been to learn how to live with them, and this has
been achieved through widespread noncompliance.128 For example, large firms rely on contractors, who in turn hire workers; thus total
employment is “sliced” into smaller packages,
each escaping the most stringent labor market
regulations. Short-term contracts and temporary employment agencies are other mechanisms used to circumvent the regulations. The
propensity of firms to hire contract workers has
increased over time for all firms employing 10
or more workers and is highest among medium-

sized firms (50–99 workers).129 A 10-year study
of 1,300 firms also finds insignificant differences
between medium and larger firms in their hiring of manual workers.130 The share of informal
workers in total employment in organized firms
grew from 32 percent in 2000 to 52 percent in
2005 to 68 percent in 2010.131
Consistent with noncompliance, the distribution of firms by size does not show substantial discontinuities around the threshold levels
where regulations become more stringent. Considering the entire distribution, including informal firms, the biggest discontinuity is between
firms employing up to 4 workers and those employing 5 to 10 (figure 9.8a). However, there is
no 5-worker threshold in the applicable labor
market regulations. On the other hand, there is
no discontinuity in the distribution when crossing the 50-worker cutoff point, despite it being
the threshold above which firms fall under the
purview of the IDA (figure 9.8b).
Admittedly, other factors could influence
India’s distribution of firms by size.132 But overall, these patterns are consistent with firms bypassing labor regulations.

India’s Central Statistical Organisation; data for the unorganized or informal sector are from the National
Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) Survey of Unorganized Manufacturing Enterprises. Own-account
manufacturing enterprises are those operating without hired workers employed on a regular basis.

While India has learned how to live with cumbersome regulatory obstacles, other developing
countries with similar constraints have accomplished more efficiency-enhancing labor reallocation. Sri Lanka inherited the same labor regulations from the British colonial administration
as India did. Without reaching the extremes in
India, many Latin American countries face similar regulatory obstacles. Although China’s labor
regulations were less stringent until the 1990s,
its household registration (hukou) system represented the ultimate obstacle to labor reallocation.133 Yet, all of these countries have managed
to spur growth in high-productivity sectors and
locations.
Sri Lanka gradually liberalized many of its
markets during the 1980s and 1990s but did not
reform its complicated and costly employment
protection legislation. Under the Termination
of Employment of Workman Act (TEWA) of
1971, firms with 15 or more employees cannot
lay off workers without official authorization
and are liable for termination payments of up
to four years of salary, depending on the em-

ployee’s length of service. Yet the country’s garment industry was a runaway success. Replacing tea as the country’s major source of export
revenue, the industry now accounts for half of
Sri Lanka’s sales abroad, up from almost nothing in the 1970s. It also accounts for much of
the increase in employment in manufacturing.134 The success of the garment industry has
been a magnet for rural migrants, with 45 percent of them moving to the western provinces
where the garment industry is concentrated.
Restrictive labor market regulations are
a common feature of many Latin American
countries too. In Brazil, after years of economic
reforms, hiring workers remains as burdensome as ever. If anything, the sustained increase
in formalization over the past decade has made
compliance with labor regulations more common. Yet, Brazil’s labor market has been characterized by massive internal migration and
remarkably high labor turnover rates. Lifetime
interstate migration is estimated to have doubled between the 1980s and the 1990s, reaching two-fifths of the population by 1999. In the
1990s, one-third of the workers who changed
jobs in Brazil’s formal sector had migrated

BOX 9.5 

315

across state borders to find employment. And
an estimated two-fifths to one-half of formal
sector workers change jobs every year.135
Nowhere is the extent of labor reallocation
more striking than in China, and much of it
happened under the hukou system. Since its introduction in the 1950s, this system governed
where people could live, effectively preventing
rural-to-urban labor flows and reserving employment in cities for their residents (box 9.5).
With market-oriented reforms, the system was
gradually liberalized, and many restrictions on
internal migration were lifted. But the hukou
system has not been completely abolished; even
today it may still inhibit migrant flows and reduce the incidence of workers moving with
dependents. Despite this barrier to labor mobility, China experienced phenomenal growth in
labor-intensive manufacturing, involving massive internal migration from the hinterland to
coastal areas, and from villages to towns and
urban centers. This geographically concentrated
development absorbed an important share of
rural surplus labor, while integrating China into
international value chains and making it the
“world’s factory.”136

China’s hukou system has been partially liberalized

A hukou is analogous to an internal passport. Legal residency in a
city, town, or village is determined by an individual’s birth place.
Rural and urban populations are registered separately. The hukou
system regulates many social entitlements of citizens, including
education, housing, utilities subsidies, and social protection.
Together with other policies such as urban food rationing during
the period under central planning the hukou system prevented
the rural labor force from moving out of agriculture. It maintained
an exclusive urban labor market with basic social welfare, and
supported industrial policy, effectively creating rural-urban
segmentation.
At the beginning of the reform process, cities and towns could
afford basic social welfare only for a limited population. Inflows of
rural workers were therefore seen as a double-edged sword that
could increase the well-being of rural residents but also lead to congestion and overcrowded infrastructure. After reforms in urban
areas were under way in the mid-1980s, and the growth of township
and village enterprises stagnated, farmers were allowed to work in
small and medium cities—but only on the condition that they continued to be self-sufficient in terms of staples, in accordance with

the food ration scheme that was still in force. Restrictions were not
lifted until the mid-1990s, when reforms were well under way. By
then, the fast growth of labor-intensive and export-oriented sectors
and the dramatic surge of private sector activities in urban areas
generated a substantial demand for low-skilled labor. Only at that
point was the hukou system substantially liberalized.
The implementation of this liberalization process has been conducted in a decentralized way. Most medium and large cities have
gradually lowered the criteria for migrants to change hukou identities, and hence their accompanying entitlements. However, the criteria remain exceptionally strict in major cities and in cities with high
income levels, including Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. For
example, Shanghai was the first city to make the residence permit
system open to all, but its qualifying conditions are among the
strictest. Shanghai’s system favors immigrants with college degrees
or special talents, and those who do business or invest. It also
requires seven years of social insurance contributions before applying. In addition, the city has a tight overall quota on hukou conversions, and the actual number of conversions has to date been very
low.

. . . through productivity spillovers
These examples point to a successful second-best
approach to offset regulatory obstacles. Instead
of trying to avoid or evade labor regulations,
this approach involves actively taking advantage
of productivity spillovers from jobs in industrial
clusters, dynamic cities, or global value chains to
make the regulations less relevant in practice.
In Sri Lanka, the development of export
processing zones (EPZs) drove the takeoff of
the garment industry. These economic enclaves
offered better infrastructure and a more favorable regulatory environment than the rest of the
economy. As a result, they attracted large inflows
of FDI and became the source of a large fraction
of Sri Lanka’s exports (figure 9.9).137 Local producers in these zones were able to benefit from
cluster effects. Outperforming competitors in
many other developing countries, the industry
has managed to move up the value chain, transforming factories into design centers.
In Brazil, the surge of internal migration is
closely associated with the country’s continuing integration into the global economy and a
development policy that favors agglomeration
effects. In the 1990s, Brazil implemented major
trade liberalization measures, gradually relaxed
restrictions on FDI, and devalued its currency.
In this context, development policy was increas-

ingly left to subnational governments, emphasizing the importance of regional hubs and facilitating a location-specific policy agenda built
on local strengths. These efforts supported the
relocation of industries toward previously lessfavored regions. While local policies were largely
targeted at fostering small and medium firms,
they also attracted bigger firms and multi­
national companies. The impact on internal
migration was significant. A 1 percent increase
in the concentration of FDI in a particular location was associated with a 0.2 percent increase
in the location’s immigration rate. And a 1 percent increase in employment in export sectors
was associated with a 0.3 percent reduction in
outmigration.138
In China, labor reallocation is rooted in the
development of competitive cities. The urban
share of the population jumped from just 27
percent in 1990 to almost 50 percent in 2010.
This transformation is unprecedented, with the
urban population increasing from 170 million
in 1978 to 456 million in 2000 and 665 million
today. The increase was supported through a
phenomenal expansion of commercial power
supply, urban infrastructure, highways, and
ports. In 1988, China had barely 100 kilometers

was second to the United States; and by 2009,
more than 60,000 kilometers were in use.139
Regional competition and experimentation
in part underpin these successes. In China, local governments have substantial autonomy to
raise fiscal and nonfiscal resources. They thus
have considerable scope to take responsibility
for local development. The Chinese Communist Party also rewards local officials based on
local performance, prompting them to actively
engage in economic competition.140
This decentralized institutional setting allowed cities in China to experiment with reforms to the hukou system as a tool for urbanization. It has been argued that a large fraction
of cities in China are too small because of it.141
But the decentralized implementation of the
­system allowed major globalizing cities to use
the hukou system as a screening tool to select
more skilled migrants and enhance the productivity spillovers from jobs. Most medium and
large cities have gradually eased the criteria for
migrants to change hukou identities. However,
bigger and richer globalizing cities have embraced a more skill-intensive pattern of growth,
putting more weight on productivity growth
than on poverty reduction (figure 9.10).142 Ac-

cordingly, the criteria for changing hukou identities in these cities are generally defined by
skills, investments, income, and residence requirements. The numbers of migrants meeting
these criteria have been small.143
Back to India, then, where the slow pace of
urbanization is even more striking than the
­rigidity of its labor regulations. In 1990, the
share of India’s population living in cities was
the same as China’s: 27 percent. Two decades
later, it had grown only to 30 percent.144 The
functionality of the cities also poses severe
challenges. For instance, large swaths of Delhi
or Mumbai have access to no more than four
to five hours of water supply a day. Energy
shortfalls have increased in recent years and are
perceived as the top constraint for doing business. A company can expect 17 power shutdowns a month. The cost imposed on firms
by the power problem is among the highest in
the world.145 Judging from the experiences of
Brazil, China, and Sri Lanka, and after 60 years
of partial success in making labor regulations
more flexible, the key for India to accelerate
labor reallocation and thereby realize its development potential may lie in its urbanization
policy.

116.	Around the world, 65 countries produce
monthly or quarterly labor force surveys,
whereas 116 produce annual surveys.
117.	 The four indicators are GDP per employed per­
son (a measure of productivity), the employmentto-population rate, the proportion of the employed population living on less than US$1.25
per day (the so-called working poor), and the
proportion of own-account and unremunerated workers in employed population (also
called vulnerable workers). United Nations Development Group 2010.
118.	 International standards on labor statistics are of
two types: those outlined in Conventions and
Recommendations adopted by the ILO International Labour Conference, and the Resolutions
and Guidelines adopted by the International
Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). The
first type of standards is part of the international labor code and is legally binding in ratifying countries, whereas standards adopted by
the ICLS are intended to provide guidance to
countries, promote international comparability of labor statistics, and encourage coherence
in concepts and methods across sources and
domains.

121.	 For example, once employment in a firm using
power reaches 10 workers (20 for firms that do
not use power), the firm enters the organized
sector and becomes subject to the Factories Act
of 1948. Once it reaches 50 workers, it is subject
to the IDA of 1947 and must offer mandatory
health insurance under the Employee State Insurance Act of 1948. Once it reaches 100 workers, it effectively loses the rights to terminate
workers.

124.	Panagariya 2008. The entire decline in the
share of agriculture since 1990–91 has been
absorbed by services. Agriculture as a share of
GDP fell from 46 percent in 1970–71 to 27 percent in 1990–91 and to 21 percent in 2004–05;
industry’s share of GDP rose from 22 percent
in 1970–71 to 27 percent in 1990–91 and remained at the same level through 2004–05;
the share of manufacturing, consequently, rose
from 13 percent in 1970–71 to 17 percent in
1990–91 through 2004–05.
125.	 The reforms focus on the liberalization of trade
and foreign investment and the dismantling of
the License Raj system introduced in 1951 to

since 2000, including a revision to the Trade
Union Law in 2001; the Labor Contract Law,
the Employment Promotion Law, and the Labor Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law in
2008; and the Social Insurance Law in 2011. The
implementation of these regulations may lead
to lower flexibility in the labor market.

Glossary

Jobs
Jobs: While precise definitions vary, jobs are labor activities that generate income, monetary or
in kind, without violating fundamental rights and principles at work. Jobs can take the form of
wage employment, self-employment, and farming. They can be formal or informal.
Good jobs for development: These are jobs that contribute the most to societal goals. The
development payoff of a job is the sum of the value it has to the worker and its spillovers (if
any) on others. The individual value is the first-order measure of the development payoff, but
spillovers can be substantial.
Jobs lens: Strategies, policies, and programs adopt a jobs lens if they take into account the
development payoffs from jobs. The jobs lens involves aims at realizing the untapped development payoffs by addressing the constraints that prevent the private sector from creating more
good jobs for development.

Skills
Cognitive skills: They include verbal ability, working memory, numeracy, and problemsolving abilities. They are the foundation for the acquisition and building of other skills
throughout life.
Social skills: They facilitate interaction and communication with others. They are based
on personality traits that underlie behaviors such as teamwork, reliability, discipline, or work
effort.
Technical skills: They enable the performance of specific tasks. They take the form of knowledge that is specific to a particular occupation or group of occupations.
Entrepreneurship: It is the combination of innovative capacity to put new ideas into effect
with managerial capacity to increase a firm’s efficiency within the limits of known technology.

Transformations
Living standards: They encompass the material and subjective aspects of well-being. Jobs contribute to living standards through earnings opportunities that lift people out of poverty, make
them less vulnerable, motivate them, and contribute to their broader happiness and satisfaction with life.
329

330  
WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 3

Productivity: It is the amount of output generated with a given amount of inputs. A higher
productivity of individual jobs, the creation of more productive jobs and destruction of less
productive ones, and the reallocation of workers within countries and across borders drive
changes in aggregate productivity.
Social cohesion: Societies are cohesive when they have the capacity to manage collective decision making peacefully. Jobs can contribute to social cohesion by nurturing trust in others
beyond the group people belong to. They can also do so by fostering civic engagement.

Rights
Core labor standards: A set of eight International Labour Organization conventions included
in the 1998 Declaration of the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These conventions cover child labor, discrimination, forced labor, and freedom of association and collective
bargaining.
Health and safety at work: Occupational accidents and work-related diseases can undermine
workers’ health, are an important source of mortality, and can have high costs to society.

Development payoffs
Spillovers: Beyond their direct impact on the well-being of the people who hold them, jobs
can have additional impacts on societal goals. Jobs may influence the living standards of others, their productivity, or the way collective decisionmaking works. Spillovers from jobs can be
positive or negative.
Earnings of others: Uneven bargaining power or discrimination may lead to labor earnings
that are too low or too high, with others gaining or losing as a result. Jobs supported through
government transfers or restrictive regulations also affect the earnings and employment
opportunities of others.
Household allocations: Jobs can change the status of their jobholders and increase their say
on how resources are allocated among household members. Jobs that empower women can
lead to greater investments in children’s education and health.
Poverty reduction: In societies that value poverty reduction, jobs that take people out of hardship increase overall well-being. In these societies, employment opportunities tilted in favor of
the poor are seen as preferable, even if aggregate earnings or output do not change.
Agglomeration effects: Work-related interactions can increase the productivity of others. The
sharing of ideas; learning from customers, suppliers and competitors; and a better matching
of skills across a larger pool of workers are among the mechanisms through which these productivity gains take place.
Global integration: Jobs linked to world markets and jobs in foreign-owned companies allow acquiring more advanced technical and managerial skills. These jobs can also change the
industrial structure in ways that favor the most productive economic units and push the least
productive out of business.

	
Environmental effects: Jobs have negative impacts on aggregate productivity when they damage the environment or lead to an overuse of scarce resources. But they can also have positive
environmental effects, as in the case of jobs to manage forests and other common resources.
Social identity: Jobs can impact the well-being of others by influencing the values and behavior of those who hold them in ways that affect society at large. Jobs can shape the norms
influencing how the jobholder interacts with others.
Networks: Jobs connect people to each other. They convey information among coworkers and
society more broadly. Jobs may also contribute to tolerance when interactions at the workplace
increase direct knowledge among people of different social and ethnic backgrounds.
Sense of fairness: Job allocations at odds with the idea of equality of opportunity may lead
to frustration and disengagement from society and collective decision-making processes.
Jobs that live up to standards of transparency and merit can contribute to the sense of fairness
in society.

Jobs challenges
Agrarian economies: In these economies most people are still engaged in agriculture, often
in very small family farms, and cities are not yet a source of economic dynamism.
Conflict-affected countries: These are countries undergoing or emerging from conflict, where
peace-keeping forces may still be needed or where deaths from conflict may still be high.
Resource-rich countries: Minerals account for a large share of exports. Exploitation of resources brings dramatic economic growth but undermines competitiveness and encourages
jobs based on transfers.
Small island nations: Their size and remoteness make it difficult for them to reap the benefits
of agglomeration and global integration. Their fragile ecosystems add to their vulnerability.
Urbanizing countries: The share of the urban population is growing rapidly. Cities are a
magnet for rural migrants but may fail to move up from exports of light manufacturing
to higher value added products.
Countries with high youth unemployment: Prolonged joblessness and idleness affect a large
share of the often sizeable youth population. The allocation of business opportunities and jobs
is tainted by privilege.
Formalizing countries: The coverage of social protection systems is large enough to envision
extending it to the entire workforce, but how to do it without undermining productivity is a
challenge.
Aging societies: The share of the working-age population is declining and the costs of pro­
viding and caring for the growing number of elderly is increasing, putting a double burden on
living standards.

General notes
Indicators
Tables 1 to 8 include 68 jobs-related indicators. These indicators summarize the level and
composition of employment in each country,
including not only wage work but also selfemployment and farming. They cover the connections between jobs and living standards,
productivity and social cohesion and provide
measures of migration. Definitions are provided
in the technical notes.

Sources
Data for 37 of the 68 indicators in tables 1 to
8 are from publicly available sources. The process of selecting these public sources favored
cross-country comparability over country coverage. For a majority of the indicators, there are
a range of additional data sources, including
national statistical offices, international repositories, and specific studies. However, only data
produced using the same criteria in all countries are retained. In most cases, there is a single
data source for each of these 37 indicators. For
instance, the five unemployment indicators in
tables 1 and 6 are entirely based on the Key Indicators of the Labor Market (KILM) database
of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Educational attainment in table 2 is an indicator that draws on two sources using different criteria: the Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA) and the Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS). These sources are jointly available for
six countries only, which allows reporting them
both without much overlap. The specific source
used in each case is noted in table 2.
The other 31 indicators in tables 1 to 8 are
based, totally or partially, on micro-data processed by the World Development Report 2013
team. The indicators entirely based on the
team’s data processing refer to skills as a constraint (table 2), the working poor (table 4),
the gender gap in earnings (table 4), workers in
micro-enterprises (table 5), wage inequality
(table 6), and youth not in school or at work
(table 6). In all other cases, data for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, other industrial countries, and European Union accession

countries, are from the OECD and Eurostat
websites. For developing countries, the indicators are based on micro-data processed by the
World Development Report 2013 team, following the same criteria and definitions as the
OECD and Eurostat websites.
The micro-data underlying these 31 indicators are from a large set of household surveys,
labor force surveys, population censuses and
enterprise surveys. The World Development
Report 2013 team relied on four large-scale
micro-data repositories: the World Bank’s International Income Distribution Database (I2D2),
Eurostat, the Minnesota Population Center’s
Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS
International, version 6.1), and the World Bank
enterprise surveys database. The team also gathered many additional living standards and labor
force surveys.
To be considered as a micro-data source for
any of the 31 indicators, living standards surveys or labor force surveys have to be nationally
representative. For highly urbanized countries,
this requirement implies that surveys cover
secondary cities and towns; for other countries,
they also have to include rural areas. In all, more
than 800 household surveys and censuses—
including data on more than 600 million
people—were standardized by the World Development Report 2013 team to ensure the
comparability of data across countries. Table 9
summarizes the source of information for the
indicators that are based on micro-data. Further information on sources is provided in the
technical notes.

Years
Data in tables 1 to 8 generally covers three years:
1995, 2005, and 2010. In a few cases, other years
had to be retained due to data availability For example, the most recent estimate of wages by occupation (in table 4) is for 2008, and the first set
of comparable observations for minimum wages
(in table 7) is for 2007. Similarly, data on educational attainment (table 2) are presented for
2003, 2006, and 2009, as these are the points in
time for which PISA data are available (TIMSS
data labeled as 2006 are actually for 2007).
For the 31 indicators computed using micro-data processed by the World Development
Report 2013 team, 1995, 2005, and 2010 are

	

reference points. The micro-data sources used
are seldom available on an annual basis. For
these indicators, data are for the nearest point
within a five-year window. For example, figures
reported for 1995 are from the closest year over
the period 1993–97. The precise year of the survey data varies from country to country.

Selected Indicators   

Unless otherwise noted, data for China do not
include data for Hong Kong SAR, China; Macao
SAR, China; or Taiwan, China. Data for Indonesia include Timor Leste through 1999. Data for
Serbia include Montenegro through 2005, and
exclude Kosovo from 1999 onwards.

Symbols
Countries
Tables 1 to 8 include 156 countries or economies. The word country may refer to any territory for which separate social or economic statistics are available. Data are shown for countries
and economies as they were constituted in 2010.

An empty space means that data are not available, or that the indicator cannot be calculated.
A “0” or “0.0” means that the value of the indicator is nil or small enough that it would round
to zero at the displayed number of decimal
places.

Table 2: Skills
•  Average schooling: Mean of highest completed level of formal schooling among all persons
aged 15 and above; in years; total and by gender (three indicators). Figures are estimated
based on data from population censuses. The
methodology is described by Robert J. Barro
and Jong-Wha Lee, 2010, “A New Data Set of
Educational Attainment in the World, 1950–
2010,” NBER Working Papers 15902, National
Bureau of Economic Research. Data source:
http://www.barrolee.com.

source: International Financial Corporation/
World Bank Enterprise Surveys, at http://
www.enterprisesurveys.org.

•  Educational attainment: Average score in
reading, mathematics and science; units are
such that the mean is 500 and standard deviation is 100. Observations from PISA are
from students aged between 15 years and
3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the
beginning of the assessment period. Observations from TIMSS (marked with an asterisk)
are from a nationally representative sample
of all students enrolled in the grade that represents 8 years of formal schooling, provided
that the mean age at the time of testing is at
least 13.5 years. TIMSS does not assess educational attainment in reading. Data sources:
PISA at http://www.oecd.org/pisa, and TIMSS

ment. Persons employed directly by these institutions are included regardless of their type
of employment contract; workers in stateowned enterprises are not included. Data
source: LABORSTA tables on “Public Sector
Employment” and “General Employment
Level,” at http://laborsta.ilo.org.
•  Employment by work status: Share of employment in wage work, self employment, and
farming; in percent (three indicators). The
self-employed include employers and nonremunerated family workers outside farming.

Data sources: see table 9.

Table 4: Living standards
•  Wages by occupation: Average wages of accountants, chemical engineers, bus drivers,
and sewing machine operators; in annual US$
at 2005 prices (four indicators). Wages are
based on data from the ILO October Inquiry
database, calibrated into a normalized format
referring to average monthly wage rate for an
adult worker and transformed into dollars
using the exchange rate of the local currency
in the same year. The data are then converted
to 2005 prices using the U.S. GDP deflator.
The methodology is described by R.H. Oostendorp, 2012, “The Occupational Wages
around the World (OWW) Database: Update for 1983–2008,” background paper for
the World Development Report 2013. Data
source: http://www.worldbank.org/wdr2013.
•  Working poor: Share of total employment
represented by workers who are members of
households living in extreme poverty; in percent. Households living in extreme poverty are
identified on the basis of poverty rates computed from the international poverty line of 1.25
US$ PPP per day at 2005 prices. The use of the
international poverty line means that figures
are not necessarily comparable to estimates
generated using national poverty lines. Data
sources: see table 9, and for the poverty rate, see
http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/.
•  Life satisfaction: Persons aged 14 and above
who answered affirmatively to a survey asking them whether they were satisfied with

their life at the time of the interview; in percent of all respondents; by work status (three
indicators). The question in the survey is: “All
things considered, how satisfied are you with
your life as a whole these days?” Possible answers range from 1(“completely dissatisfied”)
to 10 (“completely satisfied”). Responses of 6
or higher were considered affirmative. Data
source: World Values Survey, 1999–2008, at
http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org.
•  Labor share of national income: Compensation of employees as a share of GDP; in
percent. Compensation of employees corresponds is measured by account D.1 in the
SNA, and GDP by account B.1 in the System of National Accounts). Compensation
of employees includes payments in cash and
in-kind. It also includes government contributions to social insurance schemes that provide benefits to the employees. Data source:
UNDATA, at http://data.un.org.
•  Gender gap in earnings: Wage earnings for
women relative to the wage earnings of men
having the same characteristics; as a ratio. The
estimate is based on a country-specific regression of the logarithm of monthly earnings in
local currency on years of education and potential years of experience (and its square),
controlling for industry, occupation, urban
residence and gender. The methodology is described by Claudio E. Montenegro and Harry
Anthony Patrinos, 2012, “Returns to Schooling around the World,” background paper for
the World Development Report 2013. Data
sources: see table 9.

Table 5: Productivity
•  Value-added per worker: Total value-added
per worker; in annual US$ at 2005 prices; total and by sector of activity (four indicators).
Value-added is the output of a sector net of
intermediate inputs. It is calculated without
making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of
natural resources. The origin of value-added
is determined by the International Standard
Industrial Classification (ISIC), revision 3.
Value-added data are converted to US$ using
current exchange rates and then converted to
2005 prices using the U.S. GDP deflator. Data
source: WDI, at http://data.worldbank.org/

Data sources: see table 9.
•  I nformal employment: Share of informal
employment in non-agricultural employ­
ment; in percent. Informal employment
includes employment in informal sector
enterprises and informal jobs in formal

not a member of that type of organization?”
Possible answers include a variety of church or
religious organizations; sports or recreational
organizations; arts, music or educational organizations; labor unions; political parties;
environmental organizations; professional associations; humanitarian or charitable organizations; consumer organizations; and others. Respondents need to be at least 14 years
old in the case of the World Values Survey; 18

•  Minimum wage: The lowest a private sector
employer can pay a 19-year-old worker who
has no previous experience in the economy’s
most populated city; in US$ at 2005 prices.
The applicable minimum wage can be legally
enacted or agreed upon in collective bargaining agreements. When a zero is reported, it

minimum wage in force in the country or
economy. For instance, there may be rates applicable to regular workers but not to apprentices. Data source: Doing Business Indicators,
at www.doingbusiness.org.
•  Separation cost: Severance pay and others
costs associated with redundancy dismissal;
in weeks of salary per separated worker; after

all countries. The worker is a male, nonexecutive employee, earning the economy’s
average wage. The firm is a limited liability
company with 60 workers in the manufacturing sector of the economy’s most populated
city. Separation costs include the cost of advance notice requirements, severance payments and penalties in the case of redundancy
dismissals justified by economic, operational
or structural reasons, not by the behavior of
the worker. Data source: Doing Business Indicators, at www.doingbusiness.org.

Jobs provide higher earnings and better benefits as countries grow, but they
are also a driver of development. Poverty falls as people work their way out
of hardship and as jobs empowering women lead to greater investments
in children. Efficiency increases as workers get better at what they do, as more
productive jobs appear, and less productive ones disappear. Societies flourish
as jobs bring together people from different ethnic and social backgrounds
and provide alternatives to conflict. Jobs are thus more than a byproduct of
economic growth. They are transformational—they are what we earn, what
we do, and even who we are.
High unemployment and unmet job expectations among youth are the most
immediate concerns. But in many developing countries, where farming and
self-employment are prevalent and safety nets are modest at best, unemployment rates can be low. In these countries, growth is seldom jobless. Most of
the poor work long hours but simply cannot make ends meet. And the
violation of basic rights is not uncommon. Therefore, the number of jobs
is not all that matters: jobs with high development payoffs are needed.
Confronted with these challenges, policy makers ask difficult questions.
Should countries build their development strategies around growth, or
should they focus on jobs? Can entrepreneurship be fostered, especially
among the many microenterprises in developing countries, or are entrepreneurs born? Are greater investments in education and training a prerequisite
for employability, or can skills be built through jobs? In times of major crises
and structural shifts, should jobs, not just workers, be protected? And is there
a risk that policies supporting job creation in one country will come at the
expense of jobs in other countries?
The World Development Report 2013: Jobs offers answers to these and other
difficult questions by looking at jobs as drivers of development—not as
derived labor demand—and by considering all types of jobs—not just formal
wage employment. The Report provides a framework that cuts across sectors
and shows that the best policy responses vary across countries, depending
on their levels of development, endowments, demography, and institutions.
Policy fundamentals matter in all cases, as they enable a vibrant private sector,
the source of most jobs in the world. Labor policies can help as well, even
if they are less critical than is often assumed. Development policies, from
making smallholder farming viable to fostering functional cities to engaging
in global markets, hold the key to success.
