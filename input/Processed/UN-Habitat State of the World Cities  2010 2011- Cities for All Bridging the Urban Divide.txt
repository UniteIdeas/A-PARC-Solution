Foreword

T

he emerging picture of the 21st century city fits
many descriptions. Some are centres of rapid
industrial growth and wealth creation, often
accompanied by harmful waste and pollution.
Others are characterized by stagnation, urban decay and
rising social exclusion and intolerance. Both scenarios point
to the urgent need for new, more sustainable approaches to
urban development. Both argue for greener, more resilient
and inclusive towns and cities that can help combat climate
change and resolve age-old urban inequalities.
The 2010/11 State of the World’s Cities Report, “Bridging the
Urban Divide” examines the social, economic, cultural and
political drivers of urban poverty and deprivation. It argues
that much inequality and injustice stems from inadequate
policy-making and planning by local authorities and central
governments alike. Typical remedies include removing
barriers that prevent access to land, housing, infrastructure
and basic services, and facilitating rather than inhibiting

participation and citizenship. The report also emphasizes that
lasting gains are best achieved through a combination of local
action and national enabling policies.
As we grapple with old and new challenges in a rapidly
urbanizing world, this timely report can help inform research,
policy dialogue and development planning for years to come.
I commend its findings to all who are working to create the
just, green and dynamic environments that the inhabitants of
the world’s towns and cities need to thrive.

Introduction

T

his State of the World’s Cities Report (2010/11)
is published in a very important year – a key
milestone that marks the halfway point towards the
deadline for the “slum target” of the Millennium
Development Goals. Government efforts to reduce the
number of slum dwellers show some positive results.

Achieving sustainable urban development is likely to prove
impossible if the urban divide is allowed not only to persist,
but to continue growing, opening up an enormous gap, even
in some cities a gulf, an open wound, which can produce
social instability or at least generate high social and economic
costs not only for the urban poor, but for society at large.

According to new estimates presented in this Report, between
the year 2000 and 2010 over 200 million people in the
developing world will have been lifted out of slum conditions.
In other words, governments have collectively exceeded the
Millennium Target by at least a multiple of two.

This edition of the Report underlines the choices available to
policymakers across the range of economic, social, cultural
and political challenges that are needed to bridge the urban
divide. It charts a new course of action, with the steps and
levers needed to achieve a more inclusive city, emphasizing
the need for comprehensive and integrated responses that go
beyond a compartmentalized, short-term perspective.

However, this achievement is not uniformly distributed across
regions. Success is highly skewed towards the more advanced
emerging economies, while poorer countries have not done
as well. For this reason, there is no room for complacency,
because in the course of the same years the number of
slum dwellers increased by six million every year. Based on
these trends it is expected that the world’s slum population
will continue to grow if no corrective action is taken in the
coming years.
This Report highlights the unprecedented challenges which
urbanization throws at the world’s cities today – particularly
in the South – and the attendant urban divide which we all
have to address collectively to stem the multiple deprivations
that follow from unequal growth. These challenges include
grinding poverty, environmental degradation, income inequalities, historical socio-economic inequalities, marginalization and various forms of exclusion.

The Report benefits enormously from context-specific
knowledge drawing in large part on regional perspectives and
information, in a bid to inspire evidence-based local policy
responses. In that sense, this Report contributes to bridge the
gap between scientific information and societal action, which
is a simple, but fundamental requisite, to promote equity and
sustainability for more harmonious cities.

he world is inexorably becoming urban. By 2030
all developing regions, including Asia and Africa,
will have more people living in urban than rural
areas. In the next 20 years, Homo sapiens, “the wise
human”, will become Homo sapiens urbanus in virtually all
regions of the planet.
Cities – whether large or small, whole neighbourhoods, city
centres, suburban or peri-urban areas – offer human beings
the potential to share urban spaces, participate in public
and private events and exercise both duties and rights. These
opportunities in turn make it possible to cultivate societal
values and define modes of governance and other rules that
enable human beings to produce goods, trade with others and
get access to resources, culture, and various forms of riches or
well-being.
Cities can be open or closed with regard to residents’ ability
to access, occupy and use urban space, and even produce new
spaces to meet their needs. Cities can also be open or closed
in terms of residents’ ability to access decisions and participate
in various types of interaction and exchange. Some residents
find the city as the place where social and political life takes
place, knowledge is created and shared, and various forms of
creativity and art are developed; other residents find that the
city denies them these opportunities. Cities can therefore be
places of inclusion and participation, but they can be also
places of exclusion and marginalization.

The Urban Divide
Cities are constantly changing. They are built, rebuilt,
transformed, occupied by different groups, and used
for different functions. In the search for better spatial
organization for higher returns, more efficient economies of
scale and other agglomeration benefits, cities generate various
degrees of residential differentiation. In most urban areas of
the developed world, the segmentation of spaces for different
uses is relatively visible, although social heterogeneity and
mixed uses remain widespread. In contrast, in many cities of

the developing world, the separation of uses and degrees of
prosperity are so obvious that the rich live in well-serviced
neighbourhoods, gated communities and well-built formal
settlements, whereas the poor are confined to inner-city or
peri-urban informal settlements and slums.
Cities, particularly in the South, are far from offering equal
conditions and opportunities to their resident communities.
The majority of the urban population is prevented from, or
restricted in, the fulfillment of their basic needs because of
their economic, social or cultural status, ethnic origins, gender
or age. Others, a minority, benefit from the economic and
social progress that is typically associated with urbanization.
In some of these cities, the urban divide between “haves” and
“have nots” opens up a gap – if not, on occasion, a chasm,
an open wound – which can produce social instability or at
least generate high social and economic costs not only for the
urban poor, but for society at large.
Cities are, more often than not, divided by invisible borders.
These split the “centre” from the “off-centre”, or the “high”
from the “low”, as the urban divide is colloquially referred to
in many parts of the South. These man-made demarcations
are often completely different along a spatial and social
continuum, reflecting the only difference experienced by
their respective populations: socio-economic status. Closer
assessment of the urban space in many cities of the developing
world sheds forensic light on the fragmentation of society,
marking out differences in the way space and opportunities
are produced, appropriated, transformed and used. Some areas
feature significant infrastructure, well-kept parks, gardens
and up-market residential areas. In contrast, other areas are
characterized by severe deprivation, inadequate housing,
deficient services, poor recreation and cultural facilities, urban
decay, and scarce capital investment in public infrastructure.
These tangible differences in access come as symptoms of the
intangible yet enduring divisions in society that apportion
unequal opportunities and liberties across residents.
The physical divide takes the form of social, cultural and
economic exclusion. Large sections of society are frequently

excluded on grounds of predetermined attributes over which
they have no control at all, such as gender, age, race, or
ethnicity, or over which they have very little control, such
as where they live (slums vs. rich neighbourhoods) or what
they own (income and social status). However, this narrow
perspective overlooks the actual and potential contributions
of marginalized groups to the building of cities and nations,
and therefore can only delay progress toward sustainable and
inclusive development.
The urban divide is the face of injustice and a symptom of
systemic dysfunction. A society cannot claim to be harmonious or united if large numbers of people cannot meet their
basic needs while others live in opulence. A city cannot be
harmonious if some groups concentrate resources and opportunities while others remain impoverished and deprived.
Yet cities are not – and should not be – “the world which
man created, and therefore the world in which he is henceforth condemned to live”. Cities are, on the contrary, vehicles
for social change: places where new values, beliefs and ideas
can forge a different growth paradigm that promotes rights
and opportunities for all members of society. Based not only
on moral and ethical arguments but also practical access to
opportunity, the concept of an “inclusive city”, or “a city for
all”, encompasses the social and economic benefits of greater
equality, promoting positive outcomes for each and every individual in society.

Urban Trends
Urbanization: A Positive Force for Transformation

•	 Cities are merging together to create urban settlements
on a massive scale. These configurations take the form of
mega-regions, urban corridors and city-regions. They are
emerging in various parts of the world, turning into spatial
units that are territorially and functionally bound by economic, political, socio-cultural, and ecological systems.
Cities in clusters, corridors and regions are becoming the
new engines of both global and regional economies, and
they reflect the emerging links between urban expansion and new patterns of economic activity. However, as
they improve inter-connectivity and create new forms of
interdependence among cities, these configurations can
also result in unbalanced regional and urban development as they strengthen ties to existing economic centres,
rather than allow for more diffused spatial development.
The challenge here is for local authorities and regional governments
to adopt policies that maximize the benefits of urbanization and
respond to these forms of inter-connectivity and city interdependence.
The rationale is to promote regional economic development growth,
as well as to anticipate and manage the negative consequences of
urban/regional growth, such as asymmetrical regional and urban
development that has the potential to compound the urban divide.
•	 More and more people both in the North and South are
moving outside the city to “satellite” or dormitory cities
and suburban neighbourhoods, taking advantage of
accommodation that can be more affordable than in central
areas, with lower densities and sometimes a better quality
of life in certain ways. Spatial expansion of cities is triggered
not only by residents’ preference for a suburban lifestyle,
but also by land regulation crises, lack of control over periurban areas, weak planning control over land subdivisions,
improved or expanded commuting technologies and
services, as well as greater population mobility. Whether it
takes the form of “peripherization” (informal settlements)
or “suburban sprawl” (residential zones for high- and
middle-income groups), sub-urbanization generates
negative environmental, economic and social externalities.
In developing countries, the phenomenon comes mainly
as an escape from inadequate governance, lack of planning
and poor access to amenities. Rich and poor seek refuge
outside the city, which generates further partitioning of the
physical and social space.

Overview and Key Findings

By the mid-20th century, three out of 10 people on
the planet lived in urban areas. At that time, and over the
following three decades, demographic expansion was at its
fastest in cities around the world. Subsequently, a slow but
steady process of deceleration took over. Today, half the
world’s population lives in urban areas and by the middle of
this century all regions will be predominantly urban, with
the tipping point in Eastern Africa anticipated slightly after
2050. According to current projections, virtually the whole of
the world’s population growth over the next 30 years will be
concentrated in urban areas.
Although many countries have adopted an ambivalent
or hostile attitude to urbanization, often with negative
consequences, it appears today that this worldwide process is
inevitable. It is also generally positive, as it brings a number of
fundamental changes, namely: (a) in the employment sector,
from agriculture-based activities to mass production and service
industries; (b) in societal values and modes of governance; (c)
in the configuration and functionality of human settlements;
(d) in the spatial scale, density and activities of cities; (e) in
the composition of social, cultural and ethnic groups; and (f )
in the extension of democratic rights, particularly women’s
empowerment.

Using a wealth of significant and comparative new data, this
Report identifies the trends, both similar and dissimilar, that
characterize urbanization in various regions and countries; it
does so against a background of significant recent changes,
such as accelerated expansion or shrinking of cities, ageing
populations, urban and regional dynamics and regional
location factors, among others. In this respect, it is worth
mentioning two significant trends that can either help bridge
or exacerbate the urban divide:

ix

Cities must aim policies at current urban challenges (slums,
affordable land, basic services, public transport) and more
particularly anticipate expansion with sound planning
policies and related actions that control the speculation
associated with urban sprawl. Cities must also grant rights
to the urban poor, along with affordable serviced land and
security of tenure if further peripherization is to be avoided.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

The Wealth of Cities

x

The prosperity of nations is intimately linked to the
prosperity of their cities. No country has ever achieved sustained
economic growth or rapid social development without
urbanizing (countries with the highest per capita income tend
to be more urbanized, while low-income countries are the
least urbanized). Thanks to superior productivity, urban-based
enterprises contribute large shares of gross domestic product
(GDP). In other countries, it is a group of cities that accounts
for a significant share of national GDP. The clustering of
cities into mega-regions, urban corridors and city-regions
operating as single economic entities sets in motion selfreinforcing, cumulative growth patterns that are making a
significant contribution to the world’s economic activity.
High urban densities reduce transaction costs, make public
spending on infrastructure and services more economically
viable, and facilitate generation and diffusion of knowledge,
all of which are important for growth. Hand in hand with
economic growth, urbanization has helped reduce overall
poverty by providing new opportunities, raising incomes and
increasing the numbers of livelihood options for both rural
and urban populations. Urbanization, therefore, does indeed
play a positive role in overall poverty reduction, particularly
where supported by well-adapted policies. However, when
accompanied by weak economic growth, or when distributive
policies are nonexistent or ineffective, urbanization results
in local concentration of poor people rather than significant
poverty reduction.
Cities have the potential to make countries rich because they
provide the economies of scale and proximity that generate
enhanced productivity. Economic growth can turn urban centres
into effective “poverty fighters” if benefits and opportunities
are redistributed through adequate policies. Cities can also
significantly reduce rural poverty.

around the world, efforts to narrow the most unacceptable
form of urban divide as represented by slums have yielded
some positive results. According to UN-HABITAT estimates,
between the year 2000 and 2010, a total 227 million people in
the developing world will have moved out of slum conditions.
In other words, governments have collectively exceeded the
slum target of Millennium Development Goal 7 by at least
2.2 times, and 10 years ahead of the agreed 2020 deadline.
Asia stood at the forefront of successful efforts to reach
the slum target, with governments in the region together
improving the lives of an estimated 172 million slum dwellers
between the year 2000 and 2010; this represents 74 per cent
of the total number of urban residents in the world who no
longer suffer from inadequate housing. China and India have
improved the lives of more slum dwellers than any other
countries, having together lifted no less than 125 million
people out of slum conditions in the same period. After
China and India, the most significant improvements in slum
conditions in Asia were recorded in Indonesia, Turkey and
Viet Nam. At sub-regional level, the greatest advances were
recorded in Southern and Eastern Asia (73 and 72 million
people, respectively), followed by South-East Asia (33 million).
In contrast, Western Asia failed to make a contribution, as the
number of slum dwellers in the sub-region increased by 12
million.
Across Africa, the lives of an estimated 24 million slum
dwellers have improved in the last decade, representing 12
per cent of the global effort to narrow this form of urban
divide. North Africa is the only sub-region in the developing
world where both the number (8.7 million) and proportion
of slum dwellers have steadily declined (from 20 to 13 per
cent). Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia were the most successful
countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, though, the total proportion
of the urban population living in slums has decreased by only
5 per cent (or 17 million people). Ghana, Senegal, Uganda,
Rwanda and Guinea were the most successful countries in the
sub-region, reducing the proportions of slum dwellers by over
one-fifth in the last decade.
Some 13 per cent of the progress made towards the global
slum target occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean,
where an estimated 30 million people have moved out of
slum conditions since the year 2000. Over the past decade,
Argentina, Colombia and Dominican Republic have been able
to reduce their proportions of slum dwellers by over a third,
making them the most successful countries in the region.

Slums: Good News is Shadowed by Bad News
In many developing countries, urban expansion has often
been characterized by informality, illegality and unplanned
settlements. Above all, urban growth has been strongly
associated with poverty and slum growth. Fortunately, a
number of countries have, to some extent, managed to curb
the further expansion of slums and to improve the living
conditions prevailing there. Uneven as they may have been

The successful municipalities took the responsibility for slum
reduction squarely on their shoulders, backing commitments
with bold policy reforms, and preventing future slum growth
with equitable planning and economic policies. Recognition of
the existence of slums must combine with long-term political
commitment backed by adequate budget resources, policy reforms
and institutional strengthening, strong monitoring and scaling up
of successful local projects, if slums are to be tackled effectively.

In all developing regions, improving the lives of slum dwellers
calls for macro-level programmes that include housing
infrastructure and finance, improved water and sanitation,
and adequate living spaces. However, these macro-level
programmes must be associated with micro-level schemes,
including micro-credit, self-help, education and employment.

The fact that an additional 227 million urban dwellers
have gained access to improved water and sanitation as
well as to durable and less crowded housing shows that
a number of countries and cities are taking the slum
target seriously. This enhances the prospects for millions
of people to escape poverty, disease and illiteracy, and
to lead better lives thanks to a narrower urban divide.

Improving the lives of slum dwellers is the best way to achieve all
the Millennium Development Goals. Improved housing conditions
and provision of water and sanitation will not only save lives among
the very poor, but also support progress in education and health.
Over the past 10 years, the proportion of the urban population
living in slums in the developing world has declined from
39 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 32 per cent in
2010. And yet the urban divide endures, because in absolute
terms the numbers of slum dwellers have actually grown
considerably, and will continue to rise in the near future.
Between the year 2000 and 2010, the urban population in
the developing world increased by an estimated average of
58 million per annum; this includes 6 million who were not
able to improve their conditions and joined the ranks of slum
dwellers. At the same time, UN-HABITAT estimates that
through upgrading or prevention of informal settlements,
developing countries lifted an annual 22 million people out
of slum conditions between the year 2000 and 2010. Based
on these trends, the world’s slum population is expected to
reach 889 million by 2020.
Good news is coming with bad news. UN-HABITAT
estimates confirm that the progress made on the slum
target has not been enough to counter the demographic
expansion in informal settlements in the developing
world. In this sense, efforts to reduce the numbers of
slum dwellers are neither satisfactory nor adequate.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Against this background, it is up to national governments
to revise and increase the slum target to a number that takes
into account both existing and potential new slums. Those
nations that have been performing well so far must maintain
or increase efforts to improve the living conditions of slum
dwellers, while providing adequate alternatives to prevent new
slum formation. Those governments that are falling behind in
slum reduction must bring radical changes to their attitudes
and policies vis-à-vis slums and urban poverty at large.

xii

Efforts must focus on those regions facing the greatest development
challenges in slum reduction: sub-Saharan Africa and Western
Asia. Others in need of special attention are those countries
which, for all their overall progress toward the slum target at
national level, are still faced with huge spatial inequalities in
some regions and cities. Finally, efforts are also required in those
cities which, although they are doing relatively well, still feature
large pockets of poverty where people remain marginalized.

Divided Cities
The urban divide does not just refer to a fragmented space
or a community riven by socio-economic disparities. More
often than not, economic lines of divide tend to coincide
with social, cultural and political barriers. Various forms of
exclusion continue to marginalize vast amounts of human
capital ready to be mobilized for the sake of a sustainable city.

A divided city is one that fails to accommodate its poorer
residents, regardless of the social and cultural riches they
might contribute. Social divisions can permeate interactions
amongst individuals even in the absence of significant
ethnic, racial or other factors of segregation. Fresh divisions
constantly emerge and become entrenched; patterns of social
inclusion and exclusion preserve benefits for specific social
segments based on physical location, shared interests, historic
inequalities or other criteria.
If the four dimensions of the inclusive city – social, political,
economic and cultural – are to be turned from a mere conceptual
paradigm into reality, they must be implemented within a rightsbased framework, and one that is easy to enforce. Short of this,
prevailing patterns of exclusionary development, selective benefitsharing, marginalization and discrimination will continue
unabated in cities. City efforts to design and implement strategies
for inclusiveness must be based on a clear and cogent representation
of the way these four dimensions can be integrated concurrently
into the day-to-day lives of the population.
Only through explicit and deliberately inclusive processes will
it be possible to identify the locally appropriate, innovative and
high-leverage actions and policies which government, public
officials and major institutions can deploy to set in motion selfreinforcing processes that will bridge the urban divide.
Income Inequality in Cities: Contrasting Numbers
In general terms, income inequalities in developed countries
are low. However, altogether, income inequalities in developed
countries increased between the mid-1980s and 2005.
Little is known about inequalities in European urban areas
specifically, as available data is generally not disaggregated to
individual cities. Still, nationwide aggregates do not always
accurately reflect disparities in general urban or city-specific
incomes. The most surprising variations between national
and city-specific Gini coefficients of income or consumption
disparities are found in the United States of America, where
around 2005 the national coefficient stood at 0.38, but
exceeded 0.5 in many major metropolitan areas including
Washington, D.C.; New York City; Miami; and others. These
values are comparable to the average Gini coefficients of cities
in selected Latin American countries, where income inequality
is particularly steep.
Income inequalities are higher in the developing world than
in developed nations. New data presented by UN-HABITAT
on Gini coefficients shows mixed results in the various regions
of the South.
In general, urban inequality in Latin America and the
Caribbean is declining, although it remains quite high.
An analysis of income distribution trends in 17 selected
countries in the region shows that in nine of them, urban
Gini coefficients have fallen slightly between the late 1990s
and 2006. However, in the urban areas of five other Latin

American countries, income inequalities have slightly risen
or remained stable. The recent improvement in economic
conditions in various countries across the region has resulted
in a narrower income gap between rich and poor. However,
the current financial and food crises are likely to dampen the
chances for sustained economic growth in coming years, and
short of appropriate pro-poor policies, inequalities may rise
again, instead of declining further.
Trends in the economic divide in Africa’s urban areas are
mixed. Among the 13 countries under review, eight showed
lower values (if only marginally for some) and five featured
moderate to significant increases. The region’s urban areas, in
sub-Saharan Africa in particular, retain the highest degrees
of poverty in the world, together with the highest prevalence
of slum populations in urban areas. In African urban areas,
progress in poverty reduction has been rather slow overall,
but these mixed results in the distribution of income and
consumption point to the hope of future improvements.
In Asia, the economic urban divide is widening. Although
income and consumption inequality is low to moderate
overall, average incomes have increased in almost all Asian
countries, and poverty has fallen nearly everywhere in the
region, with the exception of Bangladesh.
African cities appear to be the most unequal in the world
(sample of 37 cities with an average Gini coefficient of 0.58).
Next come Latin American cities (24 cities, with a Gini
average of 0.52). Asian cities (30) feature a comparatively
low degree of income inequality, as measured by a Gini
coefficient of 0.384. Eastern Europe (8) and CIS cities (10)
feature the lowest average Gini values and, presumably, the
greatest degrees of equality, at 0.298 and 0.322, respectively.
Highly unequal income or consumption patterns in cities in the
developing world point to institutional and structural failures,
as well as to broader economic problems such as imbalanced
labour markets or a lack of pro-poor policies. The more unequal
the distribution of income or consumption in urban areas, the
higher the risk that economic disparities will result in social and
political tension.

The spatial divide in developing country cities does not just
reflect income inequalities among households; it is also a byproduct of inefficient land and housing markets, ineffective
financial mechanisms and poor urban planning. While
income inequalities are a major divisive social factor, the
spatial inequalities visible in so many cities are an outgrowth of
both socioeconomic disparities and larger processes of urban
development, governance and institutionalized exclusion of
specific groups.
When slum areas are physically isolated and disconnected
from the main urban fabric, residents become cut off from
the city, often enduring longer commuting times and higher
transportation costs than they would if their neighbourhoods

Absence of policy coordination between or within national and
local government constrains cities’ ability to meet the requirements
of urban development and to deploy strategies that mitigate
spatial inequality.
More gender-specific schemes, like maternity and childcare
benefits, vocational training, protecting women’s rights at the
workplace, and micro-credit are required if women are to be
lifted out of the spatial poverty trap.
Inequality of Opportunities
In every country in the world, access to the “urban advantage”
and distribution of the related benefits is largely determined by
various organizations and institutions – including, crucially,
the formal land and labour markets as well as public utilities.
The problem in developing countries is that most of these
institutions are weak or dysfunctional, exposing them to
undue influence from, or capture by, vested domestic or
foreign interests. In some cities, necessary public institutions
are lacking altogether, in which case essentially private vested
interests fill the void and act as substitutes for institutions
that would otherwise prioritize the interests of society at
large. In both situations, the markets for land, basic services
and labour are skewed in favour of private interests, enabling
them to claim more than their fair shares of the benefits of
the “urban advantage”. In this process, uneducated people and
young slum dwellers, particularly women, are deprived of the
formal, secure livelihoods that could lift them up and out of
the dire socioeconomic outcomes associated with the informal,
insecure conditions in which they are forced to live.
As reflected in the limited resources available for good
schooling, health and other facilities in many cities, unequal
opportunities create “minorities in the marketplace” whose
individual members are automatically excluded from a wide
range of outcomes associated with economic growth and
globalization – including demand for a skilled and healthy
labour force.
The particular ways cities are planned, designed and built says
much about what is valued there, and planning processes can
either help or hinder development of opportunities for all. Basic
services make a significant contribution to the “urban advantage”,
and together with employment feature high among the aspirations
of those who move to cities in search of a brighter future.

Overview and Key Findings

Space Inequality: The Poverty Trap

were more integrated into urban networks. On top of low
incomes and shelter deprivations, these residents find
themselves underprivileged in terms of access to the urban
advantage. Combined, the physical and social distance
between poor and rich neighbourhoods represents a spatial
poverty trap marked by six distinct challenges: (a) severe job
restrictions; (b) high rates of gender disparities; (c) deteriorated
living conditions; (d) social exclusion and marginalization; (e)
lack of social interaction, and (f ) high incidence of crime.

xiii

Today, about 85 per cent of all new employment opportunities
around the world occur in the informal economy and young
people in slums are more likely to work in the informal sector
than their non-slum peers. Despite some advantages, informal
employment ends up trapping slum-dwelling and other lowincome young people in perpetual poverty. Unfortunately,
slum areas remain a “blind spot” when it comes to policy
interventions, job creation and youth support.
So far, the benefits of the “urban advantage” keep eluding
some specific groups, and women in particular. Poverty
consistently exposes young urban females to steeper challenges
than male peers when it comes to acquiring the knowledge
and skills they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives.
Local authorities should adjust laws and regulations to lower
the costs and increase the benefits for those willing to formalize
their businesses. Local authorities should also provide assistance
to small enterprises, enabling them to upgrade skills and improve
access to both productive resources and market opportunities.
Large-scale, labour-intensive infrastructure and urban
improvement works could provide gainful employment to the
poor as well as their fair share in the “urban advantage”. These
labour-intensive programmes are to be combined with vocational
training and skill development activities.

The Social Divide

xiv

The economic divide does more than deprive the poor of
the proper shelter, basic utilities and dignified employment
that are typically associated with the “urban advantage” and
to which they are entitled. Beyond the functional goods
and services that provide for decent living conditions, the
repercussions of poverty can reach into life in its most physical
and social dimensions.
Based on a systematic comparison of slum with non-slum
populations within the same city, and groups of slum dwellers
suffering various types of shelter deprivations, this Report
demonstrates with compelling evidence that hunger, health
and poor education outcomes have strong social class gradients,
as measured by the intensity of shelter deprivations.
Hunger in cities. More and more urban populations are
experiencing hunger and often with more intensity than those
in rural areas. New data presented by UN-HABITAT on
malnutrition in urban areas – as measured by the incidence
of underweight children – shows significant differences in
food security across socioeconomic groups in cities. As the
relentless rise in food prices in urban areas combines with
persistently low incomes, the urban poor cannot afford to
purchase adequate amounts and types of food. Paradoxically,
even in those countries with enough food for the whole
population, only the richest can access it, while the poorest
struggle every day to ensure one meal for their offspring.

Based on strong empirical evidence, this Report shows that
the current food crisis is not the first of its kind. In many
places, food insecurity has affected the daily lives of urban
poor and rural families for at least the past two decades. Data
reveals that in the developing world, serious malnutrition has
been widespread in urban slums and rural areas since 1990,
regardless of local food crises. Over the past 15 years, more than
four out of 10 children suffered from stunted development in
Asia and Africa; in the poorest nations of Latin America and
the Caribbean, the proportion was three to five out of 10.
Just like poverty, hunger in cities is only the outcome of an
inequitable distribution of available resources. Children from
poor families are often born into hunger, grow up in hunger,
and might die in hunger if no remedial action is taken.
The structural food crises the urban poor keep experiencing on
an ongoing basis call for fundamental policy remedies, including
with regard to production, marketing, distribution, handling,
and control of food for the urban market.
Slum upgrading is strongly linked to health and nutrition
programmes, and altogether should be part of a comprehensive
approach to improved lives for the urban poor.
Eradicating hunger will require multiple interventions, and
not only those related to food availability. Use of safe water,
improved sanitation and durable housing materials, combined
with provision of sufficient living areas to ease overcrowding, will
improve the chances of better health outcomes and life conditions
for slum dwellers.
The health divide. The poor are typically driven to the least
developed areas of a city, often places that are poorly integrated
to the urban fabric, where dilapidated environments lead to
worse health outcomes and greater risks of premature deaths
than in improved and well-maintained urban areas. This
Report argues that cities where a higher degree of equality
prevails – including lower income disparities, lower incidence
of slums and only small numbers of slum dwellers with
various shelter deprivations – the occurrence of ill health
tends to be noticeably less frequent. Conversely, public health
is generally poorer in more unequal cities that feature stark
material differences in housing and basic service provision.
Better housing conditions are therefore essential to ensuring
a healthy population. For instance, in cities featuring large
numbers of households with all four basic shelter deprivations,
the prevalence of diseases such as diarrhea rises twofold
compared with the whole city, and about threefold or more
when compared with the non-slum areas of the same city.
Moreover, child mortality rates remain highly associated
with diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and acute respiratory
infections related to overcrowding and air pollution; these in
turn result from various environmental health hazards such as
lack of sanitation and hygiene, lack of access to safe water, poor
housing conditions, poor management of solid wastes, and

many other hazardous conditions. Children in substandard
environments are exposed to contaminated air, food, water and

Bridging The Urban Divide
Taking Forward the Right to the City

The fight against childhood diseases must look beyond the
traditional realm of the household to encompass the modern
environment of disease: the neighbourhood, and the city as a
whole, with all their attendant risks and harms.

The education of girls and young women generates powerful
poverty-reducing synergies and yields enormous intergenerational
gains. It is positively correlated with enhanced economic
productivity, more robust labour markets, higher earnings, and
improved societal health and well-being.

Where the right to the city has been implemented, higher
degrees of inclusion have not necessarily ensued, though.
Large numbers of people, particularly in the developing
world, do not fully benefit from the “urban advantage”, do
not participate in decision-making and do not enjoy effective
fundamental rights and liberties, while others do, living in
decent, healthy and environmentally friendly places with
full exercise of their citizenship. Some other countries have
made significant efforts to close the urban divide as part of
a less specific “rights-based” approach, or only recognizing
some particular aspects of the right to the city. Despite these
ambiguities, the right to the city remains a powerful vehicle
for social change.
Brazil in 1988 was the first country to include the right
to the city in its constitution. As an expert from São Paulo
commented in the UN-HABITAT policy analysis on the
inclusive city, “nowadays, talking about rights is talking
about the right to the city”. Ecuador recognized several
housing-related rights in its 2008 constitution, including the
right to the city. In that country, a respondent to the survey
component of the policy analysis in Portoviejo associated this
right with unrestricted access to services, freedom of opinion
and participation, and equal access to opportunities: “This
right is, in its broader sense, endorsed by decision-makers, as
well as recognized and implemented by the community in its
everyday life through widespread practice.”
Many other cities in the developing world devise
and deploy policies in compliance with national legal
commitments to more inclusive communities; although they
fall short of explicit references to the right to the city per
se, they endorse some particular aspects of the notion. For
example, Rosario, Argentina’s third largest city, has declared
itself a “Human Rights City” with a formal commitment to
openness, transparency and accountability. In Australia, the

Overview and Key Findings

Education: Opportunities and inequalities. Access to
education is greater in cities than in rural areas. In most
countries of the South, the “urban advantage” is quite clear
for both rich and poor in urban settings. However, not all
cities are alike in their accommodation of young people’s
education and employment needs. Social and cultural barriers
continue to deny slum dwellers the opportunity to complete
their basic education. Children from slum communities are
less likely to enroll in school and complete primary education;
and youth living in the same communities have noticeably
fewer opportunities to attend secondary school if compared
with their peers in non-slum areas. These initial inequalities
intensify at higher levels of education, perpetuating and
reproducing an unfair system that restricts the physical and
intellectual potential of millions of young urban dwellers,
whose future is denied or jeopardized for lack of equitable
distribution policies. The dilemma for many children of poor
families is not what to study in the future, but a simple and
shocking one: food, or school. Education remains a luxury for
the urban poor in the face of current crises.
This Report sheds light on the particular challenges faced
by slum populations with regard to this fundamental right,
highlighting the fact that if the urban/rural gap in education
has been reduced over time, the divide between rich and
poor populations has been widening, and is cause for great
concern. The Report also shows with fresh data that social
inequalities are not only a matter of class hierarchy, but also
of gender disparities. Still, efforts to improve the education of
girls in some countries have resulted in significant increases
in their enrolment numbers, but today a slight regression in
boys’ enrolment and participation is becoming a worrying
trend that calls for gender-sensitive responses.

The “right to the city” has evolved over the past 50 years
as a challenge to the exclusionary development, selective
benefit-sharing, marginalization and discrimination that are
rampant in cities today. More than a new legalistic device,
the right to the city is the expression of the deep yearnings
of urban dwellers for effective recognition of their various
human rights. The concept has been deployed in various
ways across regions, countries and cities of the world. In
some places it has been used as a theoretical and political
framework focusing on enforcement, empowerment,
participation, self-fulfillment, self-determination and various
forms of human rights protection at the city level. In other
places, the concept has served as a platform for action and a
practical framework for enforcement, whereas in some cities,
the concept is absent from the political discourse, either not
used at all or banned outright.

Victoria Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities (2006)
refers explicitly to equal rights, including freedom, respect,
equality and dignity for all. Some other countries and cities
endorse aspects of democratic governance that are explicitly
or implicitly consistent with the “right to the city” concept:
Dakar’s Civic and Citizens’ Pact (2003); India’s Citizen’s Charter
(1997); and Porto Alegre’s Participatory Budgeting and Local
Solidarity and Governance Programme (2004).
A number of cities in India, Ghana, South Africa, Colombia,
Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and other Latin American countries
are also taking forward the right to the city concept in a
variety of spheres (social, economic, political, and cultural),
even if progress is often rather slow and sometimes suffers
from repeated setbacks. In some other cities and countries,
particularly in South-Eastern and Eastern Asia and North
Africa, economic growth policies have gone hand in hand
with positive social developments and the populations enjoy
a decent quality of life, but political rights and freedom are
lagging behind. Other cities and countries, mainly in subSaharan Africa and Western Asia, are about to deploy legal
and political frameworks based on equality and rights.
This Report identifies the factors hindering implementation
of the right to the city and other forms of inclusion needed
to bridge the urban divide. In addition to a variety of factors
– historical socioeconomic inequalities, grinding poverty,
environmental degradation and more frequent climate
change-related natural disasters, among other threats – the
Report highlights poorly defined inclusive mechanisms and
institutions. It also points to deficiencies in the instruments
that make it possible to understand and anticipate some of
the factors generating further inequalities (i.e., scarcity of
land and concentration of ownership in very few hands; lack
of redistributive policies; ineffective housing markets, etc.).
Moreover, only very few municipal leaders have demonstrated
a proper sense of vision or political commitment to overcome
the urban divide.
UN-HABITAT policy analysis shows that more often than
not, policy aims and processes do not match because they fail
to acknowledge the inter-linkages among the four spheres or
dimensions of the inclusive city – economic, social, political,
and cultural. Admittedly, cities will, time and again, adopt
new rules and regulations in a bid to address some exclusionrelated issues; but these fail to spell out specific goalposts,
sustained processes or tangible results that can be monitored.
Moreover, institutional frameworks tend over time to embed
negative instead of positive attitudes, and to entrench informal
social arrangements that are impervious to change. The Report
details the most important factors that prevent cities from
bridging the urban divide and taking forward the right to the
city. These include (1) poor coordination among various tiers
of government; (2) absence of data for informed policy choices;
(3) influence of vested interests; (4) inadequate adjustment
to changing economic conditions; and (5) exclusion of
marginalized groups and discrimination of minorities.

Against this background, it is not surprising that more
than two-thirds of respondents to the UN-HABITAT policy
analysis survey perceived urban reforms as serving primarily
the interests of the rich, with politicians and civil servants
coming next (except in Africa, where they are viewed as the
major beneficiaries). The urban poor stand to share only
to a minimal extent, if at all, in any benefits accruing from
urbanization and related reforms. As one of the experts from
Latin America commented, “When one is [economically]
poor, one is also poor and excluded in a cultural, social and
political sense”. The majority of excluded groups in slum areas
typically fall victim to a sort of triple jeopardy: (1) they are
poor and uneducated; (2) many are migrants or from ethnic
minorities; and (3) many are female.
This Report identifies the key principles underlying the
right to the city, providing the basic underpinnings needed
by those municipalities interested in a rights-based approach
to inclusion that does not overtly endorse the “right to the
city” concept. The Report also discusses some critical aspects
that are needed to guarantee an effective right to the city
for all. In particular, this right must be seen as a vision for
an alternative, well-devised, ideal city; instead of a right to
any city, especially today’s dominant, defective model, this
is an entitlement to an urban environment where mutual
respect, tolerance, democracy and social justice prevail.
Adoption and implementation of a strong human rights-based
approach upholds the dignity of all urban residents in the face
of multiple rights violations, including the right to decent living
conditions. The right to the city can provide municipal authorities
with the platform they need for a wide range of policies and
initiatives that promote an “inclusive” urban environment.
The right to the city calls for a holistic, balanced and multicultural
type of urban development. Therefore, it must pervade all policy
areas, including land use, planning, management and reform,
and it must do so in close cooperation with government agencies
and civil society.
The Regional Dynamics of Inclusion
The urban divide results from social, economic, political,
and cultural exclusion. Taken individually, each of these dimensions has far-reaching consequences for urban dynamics
and the way policy initiatives can influence inequality. However, this Report shows with compelling evidence that these
four dimensions overlap and interact to a substantial degree.
Therefore, understanding the dynamic linkages among them
is essential to any prompt and sustainable transition from a
partially to a completely inclusive city. Any government committed to promoting inclusiveness should act in a proactive
way across the four dimensions. UN-HABITAT policy analysis highlights significant associations among them, and these

findings can be readily used by municipal and other public
authorities to guide their own efforts and policies on the way
to more inclusive cities.

Africa’s national, local and municipal authorities must improve
coordination of their planning and implementation functions if
the urban divide is to be narrowed across the continent.

Economic inclusion is tied closely to the social and political
dimensions of inclusion. Some cities grow and prosper, others
are less successful. In any of these cases, genuine economic
inclusion leading to equitable allocation of opportunities and
income is, to a very large extent, determined by the political,
cultural and social equality parameters that are specific to any
given city.

Social inclusiveness calls for a multidimensional
approach. Once again, findings show that coordination at all
levels of government is critical to bridging the social divide.
Interestingly, among all policy interventions, government
health care programmes appear to be the most effective bridge
over the social divide; in Africa, public transport features as
the second most effective way of reducing social inequalities.

UN-HABITAT analysis shows that in African surveyed
cities, economic inclusion appears to be strongly associated
with the planning functions of municipal, state/provincial and
national government, as well as with the active involvement
of non-governmental organizations that advocate stronger
political will, freedom of expression and human rights. The
connection between economic inclusion and social and
political freedoms comes as a response to extensive rentseeking by the political and economic elites that dominate the
urban economy. For all purposes and effects, this correlation
echoes a call to democratize the business sector in order
to open it up and provide opportunities for all, instead of
systematically denying these to most citizens due to weak
institutions, inadequate regulatory frameworks, and poor
government management of the economic sphere.
In Asia, economic inclusiveness in surveyed cities is
associated with government-induced employment (through
infrastructure development, for example), together with
fiscal incentives and sound contractual and legal frameworks.
Freedom of expression is also strongly associated with
economic inclusiveness in this region. This can be explained
by the expansion of the middle class as a result of economic
prosperity in various countries, which in turn is accompanied
by greater demands not just for the sake of improved social
and economic conditions, but also for transparency and
accountability.

Reform of government institutions, combined with modernized
public policies and novel forms of participation, are of crucial
importance if economic inclusion of the poor is to be improved.

In Latin American and Caribbean cities under review,
social inclusion is associated with several policy variables,
particularly in three areas: change in existing rules to promote
employment, improvements in political governance, and
freedom of cultural expression. The experts participating in
the UN-HABITAT policy analysis were of the view that an
enabling, efficient legal framework would stimulate formal
job creation and therefore it is an essential pre-requisite for
social and economic inclusion. Experts also considered that
institutions and enforcement mechanisms would enable
communities to raise their voices in order to ensure that
their demands are heard and mainstreamed both in legal
frameworks and policy decisions. Finally, in some cities
culture is promoted as a means of social inclusion. In Bogotá,
for instance, culture builds collective identity and conviviality
as an antidote to violence, illustrating its potential role in
social transformation.
A healthy, well-educated population is a major asset for any city,
and knowledge is a prerequisite for enhanced civic participation
in the social, political and cultural spheres.
Where cities fail to deploy institutions and procedures that are
more responsive to the needs of ordinary people (including the
poor), exclusion and social inequality will continue to interfere
with effective basic rights and liberties for everyone, a phenomenon
that can pose threats to social and political stability.

Overview and Key Findings

In Latin American and Caribbean cities under review,
multiparty democracy and freedom of the press are both
strongly associated with economic inclusiveness. Despite
significant progress in democratic governance, expert
opinion suggests that political institutions, rule of law and
accountability in this region do not always work properly and
still fall short of the expectations of urban populations. This
political call to amend dysfunctional social and economic
institutions is echoed in survey respondents’ perceptions that
urban policies, reforms and decisions benefit the rich by up to
three times as much as they do slum dwellers and the poor.

In the Asian cities under review, UN-HABITAT analysis
shows that improvements in social inclusiveness are closely
associated with the political role of non-governmental
organizations advocating stronger political commitment
by government, along with freedom of expression and
other human rights. This strong link suggests that these
organizations should play an even more proactive role in
the political sphere; they could, for instance, encourage the
citizenry to regroup and put public authorities under more
pressure, as is already the case in Latin American cities. Civil
society must also explore new frontiers if it is effectively to
support the institutional strengthening required to promote
equality, political rights and civil liberties.

Political inclusiveness and democratic governance.
It comes as no surprise that freedom of expression and the
press, multiparty elections and a constitutional guarantee
of cultural expression were all found to be positively linked
to political inclusiveness in the African cities under review –
even though these components of democratic politics are at
different stages of advancement across countries, and making
relatively slow progress overall. The statement of an expert
respondent to the policy analysis in Abuja that “the city is
dominated by the politics of the rich and godfatherism”, seems
to echo a general sentiment in various other African cities.
However, some aspects of democracy (e.g., proper election
standards, viability of basic democratic institutions, courts
and legislatures) and social participation are becoming more
dominant in the political discourse in the region. In Ghana,
Liberia, Rwanda and South Africa, public administrations
have been more responsive.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, too, freedom of
expression and the press is, naturally enough, associated with
political inclusion, as are multiparty elections. In this region,
the factors behind inequalities remain as challenging as ever,
and an expert in Bogotá noted that “poverty and exclusion act
as restricting factors for some groups, so that civil and political
freedoms for them often end up being more symbolic than
effective”. Although social participation is recognized as a civic
right, and good practice in this respect is not absent across the
continent, experts rated it very low. Still, in general terms, the
political process is looking very encouraging in a number of
cities and countries in this region, as it is beginning to usher
in a more positive political and institutional environment.
Various instances of best practice demonstrate the close links
between political inclusiveness, democratic governance and
full exercise of civic and political rights. Other instances show
a clear connection between cultural expression and political
inclusion (e.g., Bogotá’s Declaration of Cultural Rights).

xviii

The empirical link between democratic governance and social
inclusion highlights the need for institutions and enforcement
mechanisms that favour participatory decision-making, while
guaranteeing effective freedom of speech and the press.
Using culture for social, economic and political
inclusion. In cities as diverse as Buenos Aires, Port-au-Prince,
Chittagong, Abuja or Mombasa, cultural diversity and city
inclusion find themselves challenged by a similar set of
factors, namely, extremely inequitable provision of cultural
facilities and access to culture, technology and information
among poorer areas and more affluent neighbourhoods. This
cultural divide undermines the capacity of the poor to take
advantage of modern-day cultural and other opportunities for
self-development and enjoyment.
Numerous cities are, nevertheless, struggling to promote
culture in underprivileged areas and enabling some forms of
cultural rights and expressions; they do so through three main
channels: (1) ad hoc provision of shared spaces for cultural

events; (2) promotion of intercultural programmes; and (3)
the protection and celebration of specific monuments and
buildings that are part of the architectural heritage. In most
such cases, though, the rationale behind the promotion of
cultural expression and heritage preservation is to impose fixed
values and single, one-way meanings on places and narratives,
which are made to reflect only the history of the country’s or
city’s ethnic majority and oligarchies. Consequently, various
other cultural and ethnic groups fail to recognize themselves
in that particular history or local identity, adding to their sense
of systematic exclusion. In all developing regions, the poor
and slum dwellers appear to be systematically excluded from
cultural life, along with the elderly, young people and foreign
migrants. Poverty in Asia, Africa and Latin America conspires
against cultural inclusion. An expert in Quito characterized
this relationship in no uncertain terms: “An individual who
is poor economically will very often be poor socially and
culturally, too”. In Asian and African cities, where culture
is historically entrenched in various forms of inequalities
that persist across generations, freedom of expression
appears to be strongly linked with cultural inclusion. In the
Latin American and Caribbean cities under review, cultural
inclusiveness is positively correlated with laws that promote
equitable employment, as well as with fiscal incentives, microcredit and formal municipal promotion of culture. Cities
and countries that are bridging the cultural divide combine
effective access to education, the judiciary and other public
and private services, as well as sports and leisure activities and
amenities, recognizing that cultural diversity is essential to the
construction of citizenship. This recognition is fundamental
if traditional behaviour, attitudes and practice are to be
transformed for the purposes of an enhanced democratic
culture.
Cities should encourage anything that can foster multiple and
complementary identities in order to reduce any polarization
between various groups, particularly in a multi-cultural, multilinguistic, multi-ethnic type of society. Recognition of cultural
diversity entails the deployment of spaces and conditions that
favour various forms of active participation, in accordance with
the different societal, cultural and organizational forms that
characterize any given population.
Five Strategic Steps to an Inclusive City
An inclusive city can be defined and individually experienced
in many different ways by its residents. Still, inclusive cities
share a few basic features that can take different forms in
various conditions: they provide the opportunities and
supportive mechanisms that enable all residents to develop
their full potential and gain their fair shares of the “urban
advantage”. In an inclusive city, residents perceive themselves
as important contributors to decision-making, ranging from
political issues to the more mundane routines of daily life.
Active participation guarantees all residents a stake in the

benefits of urban development. The concepts of human
relations, citizenship and civic rights are all inseparable from
urban inclusiveness.
UN-HABITAT policy analysis has identified a series of
practical strategic steps and catalysts for change that make it
easier for municipal authorities to bridge the urban divide.
The practical strategic steps that contribute to the promotion
of an inclusive city are the following: (1) assessing the past
and measuring progress; (2) establishing new, more effective
institutions, or strengthening existing ones as needed; (3)
building new linkages and alliances among various tiers of
government; (4) developing a sustained, comprehensive
vision to promote inclusiveness; and (5) ensuring an equitable
redistribution of opportunities.

4) Demonstrating a sustained vision to promote inclusiveness.
Cities need a clear “vision” of their future – a long-term plan
that combines creativity, realism and inspiration on top of
providing a framework for strategic planning. A city’s “vision”
builds upon its specific identity, comparative advantage,
geographic endowments and defining historical and cultural
dimensions. It is not just a city’s function, structure and form
that its vision projects into the future, but also a community’s
dreams and aspirations. For this reason, any city “vision” should
always be context-driven and developed with the participation
of all segments of the population. Unfortunately, at present,
in a majority of cities, urban planning practice seems to be
divorced from any long-term city vision, and many major
decisions are influenced by pressures from various stakeholders.
Thus, an open, transparent process that integrates various
kinds of urban stakeholders has more chances to address
entrenched problems of exclusion, proposing solutions that
are appropriate both culturally and politically. Such inclusive
development of a vision and planning in turn enhances the
potential for collective ownership, as the proposed action plan
is endorsed by the broadest possible constituency. A city’s
vision must be optimistic and ambitious, and at the same
time realistic. It should be innovative if it is to break with the
inertia of the past and bring about a qualitative leap towards
the future. A vision should turn into a workable plan with
clearly defined funding sources and accounting mechanisms.
In this sense, far from being a fiction, a “vision” is a plan, a
roadmap, and a commitment that is made by city authorities
(who are the leaders, custodians and promoters of the vision)
and the other tiers of government and civil society (who are
major stakeholders in the process).
5) Ensuring the redistribution of opportunities. Cities are
places of opportunity. They act as the engines of national
economies, driving wealth creation, social development and
employment. The urban environment acts as the primary
locus for innovation, industrial and technological progress,
entrepreneurship and creativity. Strong empirical evidence
confirms that the concentration of people and productive
activities in cities generates economies of scale and proximity that stimulate growth and reduce the costs of production,
including the delivery of collective basic services such as piped
water, sewers and drains, electricity, solid waste collection,
public transport, health care, schools and many other public amenities and services. However, as it concentrates people
and productive activities, a city can become a problem if it
is inadequately planned or poorly governed, or when distri-

Overview and Key Findings

1) Assessing the past and measuring progress. The beauty and
the challenge of urban space is that no two cities are alike.
Each has its own history, economy, politics, social dynamics,
cultural beat and, above all, human potential. Cities do
not become divisive overnight; rather, as this report shows,
exclusion and marginalization build and reproduce over time
due to fierce and unequal competition for land, labour, capital,
resources, and the like. Understanding the specific factors
behind the urban divide and the way it makes itself felt in
any given city is a crucial step for those municipal authorities
committed to promoting inclusion. Such understanding can
help determine the direction of change and anticipate the
institutional and financial requirements for reform. It also
establishes a starting point from which future policies and
practices can be assessed, enabling city managers to monitor
progress and evaluate performance.
2) More effective, stronger institutions. In the cities of the
developing world, existing rules and institutions are generally
perceived as creations of the rich and powerful that frequently
cater to their sole interests, with little regard for those of
other social groups, particularly the poor. However, a new
development paradigm is placing institutions at the centre
of efforts to promote sustainable development and reduce
poverty and inequality, recognizing their moral leverage and
power of social transformation. Evidence from successful
cities shows that the way municipalities perform their duties is
just as important as the nature of what they achieve. Inclusive
cities conduct in-depth reviews of their systems, structures and
institutional mechanisms to pave the way for genuine change,
including the more effective and stronger institutions that are
part of a structural and societal transformation process.
3) Building new linkages and alliances among the various
tiers of government. Evidence from the UN-HABITAT
expert survey shows that it takes no less than the three tiers
of government (city, state/provincial and national) to make
a city inclusive, and even a fourth one – metropolitan-area
coordinating bodies – depending on local circumstances.
Unfortunately, in the developing world, reality is all-toooften at odds with this finding, as government coordination
remains patchy, poor and informal. Cities that manage both
to develop innovative programmes and actions and deploy

greater “entrepreneurship” achieve more if they establish
strategic alliances that combine policies and resources
with other tiers of government as well as the private sector.
Efficient linkages among various public authorities and civil
society also ensure greater sustainability of local programmes.
Experience shows that at the root of successful collaboration
lies an institutional and managerial capacity to share resources
such as staff, skills, funding, information and knowledge for
mutual benefit or gain.

xix

butional policies are lacking or dysfunctional. The distribution of opportunities across the population can, therefore,
become skewed or inequitable. Still, all these challenges are
outnumbered by opportunities: cities will continue to stand at
the crossroads of an interdependent world, producing goods,
services and ideas within an institutional framework that can
either overcome or exacerbate the urban divide.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Equal Opportunities: Catalysts for Distributive Change

xx

The five strategic steps described above provide municipal
authorities with the overall strategic framework they
need to bridge the urban divide and move towards a more
inclusive city. This dynamic framework is designed to
support local rights-based policies that tackle exclusion in
its various dimensions and redistribute opportunities across
urban populations. In this respect, UN-HABITAT policy
analysis has identified five catalysts for distributive change
that municipal authorities can activate in cooperation with
provincial and national government. These catalysts overlap
with the four dimensions of exclusion/inclusion as well as
with the recognized international rights implicitly subsumed
in the “right to the city”. More specifically, improvements in
the living conditions of the urban poor, investment in human
capital and fostering employment opportunities are designed
to affirm social and economic inclusion and rights, and the
other two catalysts explicitly focus on political and cultural
inclusion and rights. Socioeconomic inclusion calls for land
tenure reform and capital investment in infrastructure, which
create the conditions for people to fulfill their individual
potential. The catalysts for distributive change involve local
government practices that foster political inclusion, as well
as budgeting and planning procedures that achieve cultural
inclusion through direct involvement of ethnic minorities in
decision-making. The five policy catalysts are as follows:
a) Improve quality of life, especially for the urban poor.
Creating the conditions for improved access to safe and
healthy shelter, secure tenure, basic services and social
amenities such as health and education, is essential to any
individual’s physical, psychological, social and economic
development and well-being.
b) Invest in human capital formation. Cities and regions
are well-placed to ensure strategic coordination between
the institutions and various stakeholders involved in human
capital formation, and to design policies that are well-adjusted
to local needs. Such capital formation is a condition for
socioeconomic development and a more equitable distribution
of the urban advantage,

c) Foster sustained economic opportunities. Cities can stimulate
sustained economic growth for poor and underprivileged
populations through promotion of labour-intensive projects.
These include primarily public works and the construction
industry, which can give opportunities for support to smallscale enterprises and the informal sector. Moreover, and in
close cooperation with national government, a number of
cities in the developing world have launched various forms of
social security or protection schemes in a bid to expand access
to economic opportunities for those traditionally excluded
from mainstream wealth creation and economic development.
In this respect, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) stand out
as the most efficient poverty reduction mechanism. These
schemes enhance incomes in the short run and capabilities
in the long run.
d) Enhance political inclusion. Today, more and more
municipal and national authorities share the same basic
philosophy: bringing government within the reach of ordinary
people through enhanced mutual engagement. Some of
these municipalities are constantly trying out new modes of
political participation, creating permanent fora for dialogue
and negotiation. The physical space is becoming a political
space in terms of systems of representation and participation,
and in this sense is a fundamental aspect of local democracy.
e) Promote cultural inclusion. Culture has historically been left
out of the conventional international development agenda, or
relegated to its fringes. However, more and more scholars and
experts have come to realize that some cities in the South have
opted for a more comprehensive perspective on development,
one where culture features as one of the levers of success. More
and more local development policies and strategies are by now
mainstreaming some of the cultural dimensions of urban life,
such as social capital, tradition, symbols, meaning, sense of
belonging and pride of place, on top of optimal use of local
cultural resources by local communities. A number of cities
today are using culture as a transformational tool to integrate
ethnic minorities, preserve regional values, safeguard linguistic
and religious diversity, resolve conflicts, protect the heritage in
the built environment, and in the process promote economic
development. Beyond the sole cultural sphere, these policies
together can go a long way towards bridging the urban divide
in its other – social, political and economic – dimensions.
It takes five catalysts to integrate the poor and marginalized
into mainstream urban life: improved quality of life, investment
in human capital formation, sustained economic opportunities,
enhanced political inclusion, and cultural inclusion.

Our Shared Urban Future

Quick Facts	
1.	 In the developing world, the region with the
greatest proportion of people living in urban
centres is Latin America and the Caribbean,
whereas sub-Saharan Africa – and Eastern
Africa in particular – has the lowest percentage
of urban dwellers.
2.	 Urbanization remains a driving force of
demographic change, though it is slowing
down at different paces in different parts of
the world.
3.	 Suburbanization and urban sprawl are
happening in different places throughout the
world, spreading low-density urban patterns
and negative environmental, economic and
social externalities.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

4.	 Urban sprawl in an environment of poverty
exacerbates the urban divide.

Policy Points	
1.	 Suburbanization in developing countries comes
mainly as an escape from poor governance,
lack of planning and poor access to amenities.
Rich and poor escape to find refuge outside the
city, which generates further partitioning of the
physical and social space.
2.	 Conurbations are turning into mega-regions,
city-regions and urban corridors, and
outside these engines of global and regional
economies isolated cities have fewer chances
to prosper.
3.	 Worldwide urbanization is inevitable, and
generally positive, but equality or inequality in
cities is influenced by policy choices.
4.	 Too many countries have adopted an
ambivalent or hostile attitude to the
urbanization process, with negative
consequences.

T

he United Nations predicts that by the year
2030, more people in every region of the world
will live in urban than in rural areas, even
in Asia and Africa, which are now the least
urbanized parts of the globe.1 Our shared future will largely
come about through the social, political, economic, and
cultural dynamic that is urbanization – the convergence of
human activity and aspiration in all cities, regardless of size.
The urbanization process is characterized not only by demographic shifts from rural to urban areas, or by the growth of urban
populations, but also by changes in various aspects of society:
•	 in the employment sector, from agriculture-based activities
to mass production and service industries;
•	 in societal values and modes of governance;
•	 in the configuration and functionality of human
settlements;
•	 in the spatial scale, density and activities of places; and
•	 in the composition of social, cultural and ethnic groups and
the extension of democratic rights, particularly women’s
empowerment.
Although urbanization takes different forms and
its incidence is not uniform, the experiences of
diverse countries around the world exhibit some
remarkable similarities, as well as distinct differences.
This chapter identifies the trends, both convergent and
divergent, that characterize urbanization in various regions and
countries against a background of significant recent changes,
such as accelerated expansion or shrinking of cities, ageing
populations, urban and regional dynamics and location factors,
among others. Analysis of global trends helps raise awareness of
where there is a need to maximize gains and locate or relocate
investments and opportunities, and provides information
about how to plan for more sustainable development. Such
analysis also points to the need to design economic recovery
policies, rethink urban and regional strategies and create new
opportunities; it also offers insights into to the best ways
of anticipating urbanization and managing the negative
consequences of urban growth, such as asymmetrical regional
and urban development and various types of disparities.

Convergent Urban Growth Patterns
A slower though more pervasive urbanization
If current projections are anything to go by, virtually the
whole of the world’s demographic growth over the next 30
years will be concentrated in urban areas – a stark contrast
with the pattern that prevailed between 1950 and 1975, a
period characterized by a much more balanced split between
urban and rural areas.2 At the same time, the pace of
urbanization in the world is not accelerating, not even in the
developing world. On a global scale, the urban population
is expected to grow at an average annual rate of roughly
1.5 per cent from 2025 to 2030. The decade when urban
demographic expansion was at its fastest across the world was
the 1950s, with an annual growth rate of over 3 per cent.
By the late 1980s, this pace had slowed to an annual 2.7
per cent. Between 2010 and 2015, the annual growth of the
global urban population is expected to slow even further, to
1.9 per cent.3 Developing countries are also experiencing a
slowdown in overall population growth, from an annual 4.1
per cent in the early 1960s to 2.5 per cent in 2010; similarly,
urban population growth in the developing world is expected
to fall to an annual 1.8 per cent between 2025 and 2030.
For all this notable slowdown in urban population growth
rates around the world, current trends and projections

suggest that urbanization is to continue in both developed
and developing regions of the world. More specifically, by
2050 urban dwellers will likely account for 86 per cent of the
population in the more developed and 67 per cent in the less
developed regions. Overall, it is expected that 7 out of 10 people
will be living in urban areas by 2050. In the less urbanized
regions of the world, namely, Africa and Asia, the proportion
of the urban population is expected to increase to 61.8 per cent
and 66.2 per cent, respectively, by the middle of the century.
Urbanization is strongly linked to the development process
Already, half of the world’s population is urban, and it can
only become more so in the future. Even though various
countries are on different paths of economic development
and are making the urban transition at different times
and with different urban growth patterns, it remains quite
clear that urbanization is an inevitable outcome of the
development process. The real challenge is for governments
to adopt policies that maximize the benefits of urbanization.
A country’s degree of urbanization, as measured by the share
of its urban population in relation to total population, is also
an apt indicator of its wealth. Most nations with high per capita
incomes are among the most urbanized, just as most of those
with low per capita incomes are among the least urbanized.
Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that as a country

Urbanization and economic growth are inextricably linked
not only at the national level, but in regions within individual
countries, too. Those regions experiencing economic growth
also tend to urbanize quickly, and those urbanizing faster
typically experience higher rates of economic growth.
Cities along China’s eastern seaboard are a good example,
but there are many others, such as the National Capital
Region in the Philippines, the Mekong River Delta in Viet
Nam, Maputo and the Southern Region of Mozambique,
and Tangier-Tetouan in northern Morocco, to name just
a few. Those regions that are economically successful are
not only more urbanized than others in the same country:
they are also experiencing urban population growth rates
that are roughly two to three times the national average.
Whether urbanization influences economic growth, or the
reverse, remains a moot point. What is quite clear, though,
is that the level of urbanization (or the proportion of people
living in urban areas) is associated in some places with
numerous, positive societal outcomes, such as technological
innovation, various forms of creativity, economic progress,
higher standards of living, enhanced democratic accountability,
and women’s empowerment.8 In this sense, urbanization can
be a positive force for economic development, and also one
that has desirable social and political outcomes; indeed, some
of the world’s fastest-growing cities are also among the best
governed, and some provide the best quality of life in their
respective nations.9 In those cases where urbanization has not
been concomitant with significant improvements in quality of
life or governance, other, divisive factors may be at play, such as
extreme inequalities, conflict, inadequate or ineffective policies,
which can block development or substantially set back progress.

Cross-currents in global urbanization

becomes more urban, its per capita income also tends to rise, as
shown in Figure 1.1.1. In this sample, only Liberia, a country
recently ravaged by civil war, has experienced a decline in per
capita income while its population was becoming more urban,
indicating that internal conflicts (which in this particular case
drove thousands of rural people to seek the security of towns
and cities) have serious consequences for economic growth.
The link between urbanization and economic development
is clear in Asia, where rapid urbanization has been the
major factor behind the growth dynamic, in the process also
contributing to overall reductions in poverty rates.4 In Latin
America, economic development and urbanization have
historically been linked in a process of industrialization and
modernization, even though this has resulted in high degrees
of inequality between and within countries. In Africa, the link
between urbanization and economic development is more
tenuous, particularly in sub-Saharan countries; however, recent
research suggests a positive link between the two variables
in most African countries, as is generally the case in other
regions.5 For instance, Rwanda in the late 1990s experienced
a very high annual urban growth rate of more than 17 per
cent as the country rebuilt after a severe conflict; the pace
slowed down to a relatively high 7 per cent between 2000
and 2005, and to just over 4 per cent between 2005 and 2010
(estimates). At the same time, rapid urbanization in Rwanda
over the last decade has gone hand in hand with healthy
economic indicators as annual growth rates have ranged
between 3 and 9 per cent since 2002.6 Although today less than
20 per cent of Rwanda’s population is urban, the proportion
is expected to rise to nearly 30 per cent by 2030, compared
with just 20 per cent in neighbouring Uganda and Burundi.7

Novel urban configurations: Mega-regions, urban
corridors and city-regions
As the world becomes more urban, new residents will
continue to be distributed across cities of all sizes and much
along the current prevalent pattern.10 In some instances,
though, cities are merging together to create urban
settlements on a massive scale. These new configurations
take the form of mega-regions, urban corridors and cityregions (see Map 1.1.1). Mega-regions are natural economic
units that result from the growth, convergence and spatial
spread of geographically linked metropolitan areas and
other agglomerations.11 They are polycentric urban clusters
surrounded by low-density hinterlands, and they grow
considerably faster than the overall population of the nations
in which they are located.12 Urban corridors, on the other
hand, are characterized by linear systems of urban spaces
linked through transportation networks.13 Other dynamic
and strategic cities are extending beyond their administrative
boundaries and integrating their hinterlands to become fullblown city-regions.14 These are emerging in various parts of
the world, turning into spatial units that are territorially and
functionally bound by economic, political, socio-cultural,
and ecological systems.15 All of these urban configurations
– cities in clusters, corridors and regions – are becoming
the new engines of both global and regional economies.
Mega-regions today are accumulating even larger populations
than any mega- or meta-city (defined by UN-HABITAT as
a city with a population that exceeds 20 million), and their
economic output is enormous. The population of China’s
Hong Kong-Shenzen-Guangzhou mega-region, for example,
is about 120 million, and it is estimated that Japan’s Tokyo-

Nagoya-Osaka-Kyoto-Kobe mega-region is likely to host 60
million by 2015.16 In Brazil, the mega-region that stretches
from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro is home to 43 million
people. Although more widespread in North America and
Europe, mega-regions are taking shape in Asia and other
parts of the world as cities converge apace, with the typical
huge demographic concentrations, large markets, significant
economic capacities, substantial innovative activities and high
numbers of skilled workers that come with them. Recent
research shows that the world’s 40 largest mega-regions cover
only a tiny fraction of the habitable surface of our planet and are
home to fewer than 18 per cent of the world’s population, even
as they account for 66 per cent of global economic activity and
about 85 per cent of technological and scientific innovation.17
Urban corridors, in contrast, present a type of spatial
organization with specific economic and transportation
objectives. In urban corridors, a number of city centres of
various sizes are connected along transportation routes in linear
development axes that are often linked to a number of megacities, encompassing their hinterlands. New developments in
some fringe areas experience the fastest growth rates and the
most rapid urban transformation. An example is the industrial
corridor developing in India between Mumbai and Delhi,
which will stretch over 1,500 kilometres from Jawaharlal
Nehru Port (in Navi Mumbai) to Dadri and Tughlakabad (in
Delhi).18 Another good example is the manufacturing and
service industry corridor in Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur, clustered
within the Klang Valley conurbation that stretches all the
way to the port city of Klang.19 In Africa, the greater IbadanLagos-Accra urban corridor, spanning roughly 600 kilometres
across four countries, is the engine of West Africa’s regional
economy.20 Another urban corridor is the 1,500 kilometre-

long belt stretching from Beijing to Tokyo via Pyongyang and
Seoul, which connects no less than 77 cities with populations
of 200,000 or more. More than 97 million people live in this
urban corridor, which, in fact, links four separate megalopolises
in four countries, merging them into one, as it were.21
Urban corridors are changing the functionality of cities and
even towns both large and small, in the process stimulating
business, real estate development and land values along their
ribbon-like development areas. They are also improving interconnectivity and creating new forms of interdependence
among cities, leading to regional economic development
growth. In some cases, however, urban corridors can result in
severe urban primacy and unbalanced regional development,
as they strengthen ties to existing economic centres rather
than allowing for more diffused spatial development.
City-regions come on yet another, even larger scale as major
cities extend beyond formal administrative boundaries to engulf
smaller ones, including towns. In the process, they also absorb
semi-urban and rural hinterlands, and in some cases merge
with other intermediate cities, creating large conurbations
that eventually form city-regions. Many such city-regions
have grown enormously over the last 20 to 30 years, owing
to the effects of agglomeration economies and comparative
advantages. The extended Bangkok Region in Thailand, for
example, is expected to expand another 200 kilometres from
its current centre by 2020, growing far beyond its current
population of over 17 million. In Brazil, Metropolitan São
Paulo already spreads over 8,000 square kilometres, with a
population of 16.4 million.22 The full extent of South Africa’s
Cape Town city-region, when including the distances from
which commuters travel to and from every day, reaches up to
100 kilometres. Some of these city-regions are actually larger
in both surface area and population than some entire countries
like Belgium, the Czech Republic or the Netherlands.
Mega-regions, urban corridors and city-regions reflect the
emerging links between city growth and new patterns of
economic activity. These regional systems are creating a new
urban hierarchy and the scope, range and complexity of issues
involved require innovative coordination mechanisms for urban
management and governance. The World Bank has identified
the three main issues that these configurations face, namely:
•	 Coordination, “conceiving the development of cities in
parallel with the development of regions and sub-regions,
rather than isolated nodes in economic space”, a process
that calls on metropolitan, regional and even national planners to work together;
•	 Broader plans for regional planning/development, “requiring dispersion of specific urban functions (i.e., solid waste
treatment, airports, skills and training centres) within a
continuous region, rather than crowding them in a large
city”; and
•	 Coping with horizontal fiscal disparities, and more specifically “designing mechanisms to transfer fiscal
resources among urban governments in a region”.23

Suburbanization is becoming more prevalent
More and more people, particularly young families and
the affluent middle-aged, are living in satellite or dormitory
cities and suburban neighbourhoods, taking advantage of
accommodation that can be more affordable than in central
areas, with lower densities and a better quality of life in certain
ways. In some cases, spatial expansion of cities is triggered by
factors other than residents’ preference for a suburban lifestyle.
These include land regulation crises, lack of control over periurban areas, weak planning control over land subdivisions
that leads to various forms of speculation, improved or
expanded commuting technologies and services, as well as
greater population mobility. Some of the other factors behind
suburbanization are characteristic of poorly managed cities,
such as pollution, traffic congestion, lack of car parks and poor
public amenities. Spatial expansion is also triggered by changes
in lifestyles that are disseminated through large urban centres,
propelled by the globalization of consumption patterns, in turn
bringing more homogeneity across diverse areas of the world.24
The suburban growth pattern of urbanization has long been
strongly associated with North American cities; over the past
decade, though, there have been signs that suburbanization,
or what is known as a form of “horizontal spreading”,
“dispersed urbanization” or urban sprawl, is happening in
many metropolitan areas of the world. Urban sprawl has
always been a pejorative term for the uncontrolled expansion
of urban areas, characterized by voracious consumption of
land for the purposes of low-density development. Under
the many forms it takes in various cities of the world, sprawl
happens when population growth and the physical expansion
of a city are misaligned. The Los Angeles metropolitan
area in the United States is a classic case in point: between
1970 and 1990, its population grew by 45 per cent,
while its built surface area expanded by 300 per cent.25
Urban sprawl is increasingly happening in developing
countries as well, as real estate developers are promoting
the image of a “worldclass lifestyle” outside the city.
Research in Guadalajara, Mexico, between 1970 and the
year 2000 showed that the surface area of the city grew 1.5
times faster than the population.26 Similar research shows
that urban sprawl is consuming considerable amounts of
land in cities as diverse as Antananarivo in Madagascar,
Beijing in China, Johannesburg in South Africa, Cairo
in Egypt and Mexico City in Mexico, to name just a few.
In both developing and developed countries, sprawl involves
four dimensions: a population that is widely scattered in
low-density developments; residential and commercial areas
that are spatially separate; a network of roads characterized
by overstretched blocks and poor access; and a lack of welldefined, thriving activity hubs, such as “downtown” areas
and city centres. Other features typically associated with
sprawl include overdependence on motorized transport
coupled with a lack of alternatives, a relative uniformity
of housing options, and pedestrian-unfriendly spaces.27

particularly along socio-economic lines, results in spatial
disparities in wealth and quality of life across various parts
of cities and metropolitan areas, dilapidated city centres,
and suburbs. To put it in a nutshell: sprawl is a symptom
of a divided city. Suburbanization in developing countries
happens mainly as an escape away from poor governance,
lack of planning and poor access to amenities. “Rich and
poor find refuge in escaping the city”30, which generates
further partitioning of the physical and social space.
Urban sprawl has a wide range of implications. In most cases,
it will lead to an increase in the cost of public infrastructure and
of residential and commercial development. Sprawl adds to
the costs and inefficiencies of transportation, resulting in high
energy consumption. Sprawling metropolitan areas consume
much more energy than compact cities and require larger
outputs of materials such as metal, concrete and asphalt because
homes, offices and utilities are farther apart.31 Sprawl also creates
fiscal problems for cities, as it takes place outside of urban
administrative boundaries. While suburban municipalities
benefit from tax revenues with increased development, it
is central cities or downtown municipalities that foot the
bill for many daytime services used by suburban residents.
Moreover, in many places, urban sprawl causes significant
losses of prime farmland as new developments absorb arable
land. In the absence of proper planning, urban sprawl also
contributes to the degradation of a number of environmental
resources; for instance, it has caused substantial damage
to environmentally sensitive areas around several cities in
Latin America, including Panama City and its surrounding
Canal Zone, Caracas and its adjacent coastline, San José de
Costa Rica and its mountainous area, and São Paulo and its
water basins. Informal provision of services to the poor in
peri-urban areas is also very wasteful and expensive (to the
poor in the short term, and to the city in the long term)
and is a further significant cause of urban dysfunctionality.

Cross-currents in global urbanization

For instance, most South African cities are expanding
primarily through development of new housing areas which,
being located beyond the existing urban periphery, are
relatively unplanned. As a result, the urban periphery consists
of pockets of housing developments that are isolated and
separated from each other by trunk roads or open spaces.
In many developing countries, urban sprawl generates
a configuration involving two main, contrasting types
of development in one and the same city: (1) a form of
“peripherization” that is characterized by large peri-urban
areas with informal and illegal patterns of land use, combined
with a lack of infrastructure, public facilities and basic services,
and often accompanied by a lack of both public transport
and adequate access roads; and (2) in contrast, a form of
“suburban sprawl” characterized by residential zones for highand middle-income groups and highly valued commercial
and retail complexes that are well-connected by individual
rather than public transport. In most cases, residential areas
coexist with huge commercial centres located along main
highways.28 In some developing countries, urban sprawl is the
consequence of poverty, not affluence, as informal unplanned
settlements on the periphery spring up in response to a lack
of affordable housing options within the city itself. In this
sense, urban sprawl results from a lack of policy attention to
current urban challenges (slums, land, services, transport),
and more particularly an inability to anticipate urban growth,
including through provision of land for the urbanizing
poor. Denial of permanent land rights to the urban poor
is one of the main factors behind the “peripherization”
associated with urban sprawl in developing countries.29
From a social and spatial perspective, urban sprawl
contributes to the urban divide. It has a negative impact not
only on the infrastructure and sustainability of cities, but
also on social cohesion, often exacerbating social segregation
and segmentation. The spatial separation of social groups,

Divergent Urban Growth Patterns

No uniform “tipping point” across regions

While similar modes of urbanization and urban growth
are evident in many cities around the world, there are
also significant differences in the patterns of urbanization
among regions and even greater variations in the degree,
pace and nature of individual country and city growth. This
section discusses the most distinct and unique patterns of
urbanization and urban growth in various regions of the world.

Sometime during the year 2008, and for the first time in
human history, the world’s population became more urban
than rural. Although more people overall are now living
in urban centres than in rural areas, not all regions have
yet experienced their own urban transitions; in fact, some
regions are not expected to reach the urban population
“tipping point” for another 20 to 30 years. (See Table 1.1.1)

Considering the challenges of definition and the fact that
many successive degrees of urbanization separate truly rural
places and major cities, it is expected that the tipping point
for “urban Asia” and “urban Africa” will happen in 2023 and
2030, respectively. South-Central Asia, the least urbanized
sub-region in Asia, will not achieve the urban transition until
2040, primarily because in the two large countries in the
region, India and Bangladesh, seven out of every 10 in the
population still live in rural areas today. The least urbanized
part of Africa, the Eastern sub-region where urbanization
was not strongly linked to industrialization or modernization
until recently,35 will remain predominantly rural until after
2050, when projections suggest that only 47.6 per cent of
the population will be living in urban areas. However, huge
demographic and social transformations are occurring in
this sub-region, which is currently experiencing the highest
urban growth rate in the world (3.87 per cent in 20002005); this points to the need for local and national policies
that respond positively to current urbanization challenges.
By 2050, 70 per cent of the world population is likely to
be living in urban environments. In this respect, some of the
patterns emerging in specific projections are worthy of note.
South America will be the most urban region in the world (91.4
per cent), followed by Northern Europe (90.7 per cent) and
North America (90.2 per cent). The least urbanized regions by
the middle of the 21st century will remain Africa (61.8 per cent)
and Asia (66.2 per cent): they will be slightly below the global
average of 70 per cent. It must be stressed that in those two
continents, the already more urbanized sub-regions – North
and Southern Africa, and Eastern and Western Asia – will see
further increases in the urban segment of the population to the
point where, by 2050, their respective shares of urban dwellers
will be larger than those currently prevailing in Europe.
The fact that by 2050 Latin America and the Caribbean,
and particularly South America, is projected to feature
the highest proportion of urban population in the world
somewhat challenges the notion that urbanization can be
taken as a proxy for the level of development in general.36
Notwithstanding definition problems, and considering that
urban data has not been harmonized and urban projections
are devoid of adjustment factors, it is possible that over the
next 40 years, some countries in the South American subregion will have significantly reduced poverty and inequalities
to the standards of today’s developed nations, while others
will not. It is unlikely that by 2050 the sub-region will rank
among the first in the Human Development Index and boast
one of the highest GDPs per capita; still, the region shows
some promise in terms of human development indicators:
average life expectancy is comparable to North America’s, and
infant mortality is the lowest among developing regions.37
Moreover, the changing structure of urban patterns in
Latin America and the Caribbean, characterized by a rapid
increase in the number of secondary cities and the reduction
of urban primacy, is another distinctive feature of the region
that is certain to bring more prosperity to secondary cities.

Cross-currents in global urbanization

In the more developed regions (Europe, North America
and Oceania), the tipping point from a predominantly
rural to a majority urban population occurred in the mid1950s, while in some countries, such as the United States,
it took place as early as the beginning of the 20th century.32
In the developing world, the first and only region to become
predominantly urban before 2008 was Latin America and
the Caribbean, where at least half of the population has been
living in places formally designated as “cities” and “towns”
since the early 1960s. Three distinct factors combined to
bring about this evolution: (1) a very unequal agrarian
structure, with little capacity to retain the rural population;
(2) political centralism, which concentrated power in the
capitals of individual federated states, and (3) government
policies favouring import substitution (in some countries
since the 1930s, in others since the 1950s).33 A relatively early
urbanization trend is also notable in two sub-regions of the
developing world, Southern and North Africa, which passed
the “urban tipping point” in 1993 and 2005, respectively,
despite significant efforts to prevent urbanization.34
In today’s world, different regions find themselves at
different levels on the urbanization scale. At one extreme,
North America boasts the highest proportion of people living
in urban areas, at 82.1 per cent. The second and third most
urbanized regions are Latin America and the Caribbean
and Europe, with 79.4 per cent and 72.6 per cent of their
populations living in urban areas, respectively. At the other end
of the spectrum, Africa and Asia have the lowest proportions
of urban residents in the world, with 40 per cent and 42.5
per cent of their populations in urban areas, respectively,
or significantly below the global average of 50.6 per cent.
Northern Europe is the world’s most urbanized sub-region
with, on average, 84.4 per cent of its population projected to
live in urban areas by 2010. The sub-region of South America
comes next, with 83.7 per cent of its population projected to live
in cities and towns, slightly more than North America, which
ranks third. The next most urbanized sub-region is Western
Europe (77 per cent). At the other end of the urbanization
spectrum, Eastern Africa ranks last by far, with just 23.7 per
cent of its population projected to live in urban areas by 2010.
The proportion is higher in South-Central Asia (32.2 per cent),
while in Eastern- and South-Eastern Asia rates of urbanization
remain relatively low, with the urban population accounting
for just under 50 per cent in both sub-regions (Table 1.1.1).
Caution is in order here as urbanization rates and trends in
different regions are, of course, largely affected by the formal
definition of what constitutes a “city” or ”urban area” in every
country, which in turn seriously affects comparability across
regions and countries. What constitutes an urban area differs
from one country to another. For example, in Uganda, a
settlement with a population of more than 2,000 is classified as
urban, whereas in Nigeria and Mauritius the benchmark is 10
times higher; in China, those settlements with more than 3,000
residents are considered “urban”, while only those with 60,000
or more are “cities”. Urban areas are also typically defined
by the administrative and legislative functions they serve,
further complicating the designation of urban settlements.

Not all cities in developing nations are experiencing rapid
population growth
By the middle of the 21st century, the total urban population
of the developing world will more than double, from 2.5
billion in 2010 to 5.3 billion in 2050.38 Between 1995 and
2005 alone, the urban population of the developing world
grew by an average of 1.2 million per week, or around 165,000
every day.39 Not all cities contribute equally to this rapid
growth, and neither is it unprecedented or out of control.
Many cities, including Kolkata, Chennai, Recife, Santiago,
Monterrey, Algiers, Alexandria, Maputo and Lusaka are
experiencing relatively low annual growth rates (1 to 2 per
cent), and further slowdowns are likely over the coming
years. Somewhat surprisingly, a number of other cities
in the developing world find themselves experiencing
population declines (particularly in central areas), such as
Rabat, La Paz, Belo Horizonte, San Luis Potosi, Dengzhou,
Madurai, Bandung and Manila, to name just a few.
On the other hand, recent high annual growth rates of over 4
per cent have rapidly transformed many cities in the developing
world, including Bamako, Abuja, Kinshasa, Ouagadougou
and Sana’a, suggesting that on current trends their populations
will double in about 17 years. Some of the fastest-expanding
cities have seen their populations double in fewer than
eight years, owing to phenomenal annual growth rates of
over 8 per cent (see Figures 1.1.2-4). Some cities in China,
such as Shenzhen and Shangqiu, experienced exceptionally

high annual growth rates of over 17 per cent in the 1990s.
Across Africa, rapid urban expansion is widespread, with
13 agglomerations experiencing annual growth rates of over
4 per cent. Between 2005 and 2010, Africa experienced the
highest urban growth rates in the world—an annual 3.3 per
cent average—and the pace is expected to remain relatively
high over the next 15 years. On the other hand, demographic
growth is slowing down in Asian and Latin American cities,
and this is expected to continue over the next decade.
Generally speaking, high rates of urban growth still
characterize urban change in the developing world, where the
annual average was 2.5 per cent between 1990 and 2006.40
However, that is not uniformly the case; for every 100 cities
in the developing world, 15 grew at high annual rates of over
4 per cent, compared with 2 to 4 per cent for another 32
cities. On the other hand, more than half (53 out of 100)
grew rather slowly: 1 to 2 per cent for 22 of these, and under 1
per cent for another 19. Moreover, 11.4 per cent of cities saw
both their economies and their populations regress between
1990 and 2006. Declining urban populations is a relatively
new phenomenon in the developing world, though not yet
as prevalent as in the developed world where a significant
40 per cent of cities have seen a fall in their populations.41
Demographic contraction may, however, pave the way for a new
urban trend that is starting to unfold in the developing world.

Box 1.1.1: High urban growth rates,
but Eastern Africa remains
predominantly rural
Although they can boast some of the highest urban growth rates,
East African countries remain the least urbanized in the world and
will only begin to experience an urban transition by the middle of this
century. Only 22.7 per cent of the region’s population was classified
as “urban” in 2007, with some countries featuring significantly lower
proportions. The least urbanized countries include Burundi (10.1 per
cent), Ethiopia (16.6 per cent), Rwanda (18.2 per cent) and Uganda
(12.8 per cent). It is worth noting here that countries with similar
income levels and human development indicators, such as Benin in
Western Africa and Angola in Central Africa, feature higher rates of
urbanization – 40.8 per cent and 55.8 per cent, respectively.
In East Africa between 2005 and 2010 (estimate), annual urban
growth rates range from a high of 6.8 per cent in Burundi to a low of
1.4 per cent in the Seychelles. Countries with relatively high annual
urban growth rates over 4 per cent include Eritrea, Ethiopia, Malawi,
Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda. It must be
noted that while most East African countries are expected to see
a deceleration in the growth of their urban population rates in the
next decade, a few may instead experience a surge. For instance,
having featured an annual rate of 3.9 per cent between 2005 and
2010 (estimate), Kenya’s urban population growth is expected to
accelerate to 4.2 per cent between 2015 and 2020. Similarly, projections suggest that Uganda’s urban growth rates are bound for a
significant rise, from the current 4.4 per cent to over 5 per cent in
the next decade.
However, high urban growth rates in East Africa are not anywhere
near the “tipping point” where a national population becomes predominantly urban. United Nations projections indicate that by 2030,
only 33.7 per cent of the region’s total population will be urban. For
most countries – except those already highly urbanized, such as Djibouti, Mauritius, Reunion and Seychelles – the transition will only
occur after 2040, with the exception of Mozambique, Somalia and
Zimbabwe, where it is expected by 2030.
The low rates of urbanization in East Africa result from a variety of
factors, including low industrialization, over-dependence on subsistence agriculture, inadequate or outdated land policies, lack of prourban development strategies, insufficient investment in secondary
and small cities, past colonial policies that discouraged rural-to-urban
migration, and apparent lack of political will to address the “urban
question” and turn cities and towns into engines of national growth.
Another particular aspect of the urbanization process in the least urbanized East African countries is that of “divided loyalties” – conflicts
between communal loyalty and obligations to ancestral rural land,
or to clan and family ties, on the one hand, and the need to adapt
to and participate in a modern, urbanizing world, on the other hand.
This phenomenon prevents many rural migrants from fully embracing
the city as their home or engaging with local authorities to demand
better services and rights. Consequently, many cities in the region
can be described as hosting “transplanted villagers” who are yet
to be turned into truly urban citizens whose loyalties, investments,
livelihoods and future prospects are intimately linked with the cities
where they live.

The wealth of cities

The City-Nation Nexus

Quick Facts	
1.	 Urbanization and economic growth typically
happen in tandem; however, equitable
distribution of benefits and opportunities
remains a challenge.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

2.	 Demographic expansion in cities nowadays
stems more from natural growth than ruralurban migration, including in sub-Saharan
Africa.

18

3.	 Urbanization, when accompanied by weak
economic growth, results in a concentration of
poor people in cities rather than in significant
poverty reduction.
4.	 Countries with the highest per capita income
tend to be more urbanized, while low-income
countries are the least urbanized.

Policy Points	
1.	 Cities have the potential to make countries
rich because they provide the economies of
scale and proximity that generate enhanced
productivity.
2.	 Urban centres that are economically growing
can be real poverty fighters if adequate
policies are implemented; they can also
significantly reduce rural poverty.

T

he prosperity of nations is intimately linked to
the prosperity of their cities. No country has
ever achieved sustained economic growth and
rapid social development without urbanizing.
Evidence shows that the transition from low-income to
middle-income country status is almost always accompanied
by a transition from a rural to an urban economy.1
Thanks to their superior productivity, urban-based
enterprises contribute large shares of the gross domestic
product (GDP) of nations. In some countries, such as Korea,
Hungary and Belgium, it takes only a single city to contribute
the more substantial share of national wealth – almost half
in the case of Seoul, and roughly 45 per cent in the case of
Budapest and Brussels.2 In other countries, it is a group of
cities that accounts for a significant share of national GDP. In
South Africa, for example, six major cities concentrating 31 per
cent of the total population together contribute as much as 55
per cent of national GDP.3 In both India and China, the five
largest cities contribute approximately 15 per cent of national
GDP in 2004 – roughly three times what could have been
expected based solely on their relative shares of the population.4
Cities have the potential to make countries rich because they
provide the economies of scale and proximity to make growth
more efficient. High densities in cities reduce transaction
costs, make public spending on infrastructure and services
more economically viable, and facilitate the generation
and diffusion of knowledge, all of which are important for
growth. Regardless of whether cities fuel economic growth
or are, instead, its by-product, it is indisputable that cities
have become major hubs of economic activity, both within
individual countries and as contributors to the global economy.

Table 1.2.1 and Figure 1.2.1 show the relative shares of a
group of selected cities from both developed and developing
countries in terms of land size, population and gross domestic
product (GDP) relative to the country as a whole. In all
cases, the economic output of the cities is much higher than
the corresponding land inputs. In addition, all but one of the
selected cities contribute a larger share of the country’s GDP
than their share of the total population. Guangzhou and
Brussels offer the most telling examples, with a GDP share
that is 5 and 4.4 times higher, respectively, than their share
in their respective national populations.5 The only exception
is Sydney, which produces a lower share of GDP than the
proportion of the Australian population that calls the city home.
Exclusive focus on the GDP contribution of urban areas
can be misleading, though. Rather than individual areas, it
is often clusters of cities that function as a single economic
entity and set in motion self-reinforcing, cumulative
growth patterns.6 For instance, Johannesburg, Pretoria and
the East Rand function as more of a single city-region – a
cluster of economically linked and interdependent cities
– than as three geographically separated cities. The three
have substantial geographical advantages: they are relatively
close to the largest international airport in Africa, and they
are well connected through a highway network to the ports
of Durban, Richards Bay and Cape Town as well as to
those in neighbouring Maputo in Mozambique and Walvis
Bay in Namibia. Taking this “cluster” city as a whole, its

contribution to South Africa’s GDP is greater than 31 per
cent.7 The fact that Johannesburg is host to two-thirds of all
South Africa’s corporate headquarters and 60 per cent of the
top 100 companies underscores its economic importance.8
Cities also concentrate a large share of economic activity
worldwide. When adjusting the actual GDP per capita by the
costs of living in individual cities (i.e., purchasing power parity
– PPP) and ranking them by GDP, the top 25 cities accounted
for roughly 15 per cent of the world’s GDP in 2005.9 This
share increases to around one-fourth of the world’s GDP when
the top 100 cities are included (see Figure 1.2.2). The largest
cities in the major developed economies are at the top of the
global GDP rankings, with Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Paris and London being the top six in 2005. Tokyo
alone accounts for almost 2 per cent of the world’s GDP.
The economic power of these cities is comparable to that
of many national economies. Tokyo and New York have an
estimated GDP similar to those of Canada or Spain, while
London’s GDP is higher than that of Sweden or Switzerland.
Four megacities in developing countries are currently in the top
30 GDP ranking – Mexico City, Buenos Aires, São Paulo, and
Rio de Janeiro – accounting for 1.5 per cent of the global GDP.
Fast-growing cities such as Shanghai, Mumbai, Istanbul and
Beijing are expected to move into the global top 30 by 2010.10
The larger contribution of some cities to the country’s
GDP relative to their share of the population points to the
advantages of urban areas. Specifically, cities benefit from the
efficiency gains and consumption benefits arising from location
advantages, economies of scale and agglomeration economies,
including lower prices for inputs, greater access to specialized
services, lower transaction costs, and more fluid knowledge
sharing. In turn, these advantages attract fast growing sectors
of the economy, including services and manufacturing, into
cities – in fact, urban agglomeration seems to be a prerequisite
for industrialization. The competitive advantages of cities are
even more important in developing countries, where poor
transportation and communication infrastructure in the
hinterland exacerbates the cities’ location advantages that
enable firms to access not only the larger domestic markets
within the cities themselves, but also export markets.11
Data indicates that predominantly urban regions have
a consistently higher GDP per capita than those that are
predominantly rural. On average, in 2005, those in OECD
countries generated a GDP per capita that was 57 per cent
higher than predominantly rural regions: US $30,882,
compared with US $19,623.12 The same relationship holds for
all OECD countries at the national level, with the exception
of South Korea, where GDP per capita is significantly higher
in predominantly rural regions than in urban ones: US
$23,886 and US $16,274 in 2005, respectively. This unusual
pattern reflects a two-pronged government policy: significant
subsidies stabilize agricultural production in order to maintain
food security; and expanding non-agricultural industries have
been turned into a main source of income in rural areas, in
a bid to promote economic equality with urban areas.13 In
all other OECD countries, GDP per capita is consistently

Note: Rural share of GDP is estimated based on the share of the agricultural sector, while the
urban share is estimated based on the combined share of GDP produced in the manufacturing
and service sectors. These are divided by the rural and urban population to obtain the rural
and urban GDP per capita, respectively.

higher in predominantly urban areas. The urban-rural gap
in terms of GDP per capita ranges between 15 per cent
for Japan and 210 per cent in Hungary (see Figure 1.2.3).
Whether urbanization causes economic growth or economic
growth causes urbanization, it is indisputable that urbanization
and growth go together. As shown in Figure 1.2.5, over the past
four decades countries around the world have experienced,
on average, increases in both their urban population and
per capita income. While the urban population worldwide
increased from 33 to 42 per cent between 1960 and 2000,
per capita income more than doubled over the same period.14

The data also suggests a strong empirical relationship between
urbanization and per capita income across countries.15 As shown
in Figure 1.2.6, countries with the highest per capita income
tend to be more urbanized, with at least 70 per cent of their
population living in urban areas. Likewise, the populations
of middle-income countries tend to be at least 50 per cent
urban, while low-income countries are the least urbanized.
The positive relationship between economic growth and
urbanization is also evident when countries are aggregated
by income level. As shown in Table 1.2.2, high-income
countries exhibit both the highest GDP per capita and
urbanization levels, while low-income countries are at the
other end of the spectrum, with the lowest GDP per capita
and urbanization levels.16 Likewise, those regions that
exhibit the highest levels of urbanization are also the ones
with the highest GDP per capita, as illustrated by the fact
that Latin America and the Caribbean, with the highest
proportion of urban population in the developing world,
also has a higher GDP per capita than Asia and Africa.
Looking at the sub-regions of the developing world, the
only exception to the rule is sub-Saharan Africa: although
countries there tend to be more urbanized than those in
Southern Asia, their GDP per capita is lower (36 per cent
and US $601 in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with 29 per
cent and US $647 in Southern Asia). This phenomenon,
which some authors refer to as “pathological urbanization”
(see Box 1.2.1) or “urbanization without growth” does not
really “describe what has been happening in most African
countries” 17, which like all other regions of the world feature
a normal, linear relationship between urbanization and
economic growth. As explained by Kessides, in Africa this
relationship “has simply not been sufficient to propel most
of the countries into the realm of per capita income increases
needed to overcome poverty sustainably”.18 It is expected,
however, that the relatively high economic growth rates which
several African countries have experienced these past few years
will cause proportional increases in the urban population, as
cities stand to attract more migrants not just from villages,
but from other cities as well. This trend is in line with those
in urban Europe in the latter part of the 19th century, when
the Industrial Revolution led to a surge in urban populations
and rising incomes. It was only in the early part of the 20th
century that the problems associated with rapid urban
growth – including slum proliferation and inequality – were
addressed in a significant manner to reduce overall poverty.
It is important to note that rural-urban migration is just
one of the three drivers of urbanization in today’s world,
accounting for only about 25 per cent. The other two factors
are natural population increases and reclassification of rural
into urban areas (see Box 1.3.2).19 Rural-urban migration
plays a relatively more significant role in regions with initial
low rates of urbanization, such as Eastern and Southern Asia,
sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa and the Middle East.
Conversely, it comes as no surprise that natural demographic
growth within cities is relatively more important in regions
where large parts of the population are already urban, such as
Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia.

Urbanization and poverty
Overall, the relationship between urbanization and
poverty is a positive one, as the incidence of poverty tends
to be less pronounced in urban than in rural areas. This
urban/rural divide tends to prevail across the world. Figure
1.2.7 shows the poverty rates in cities and the countryside
with respect to the national rural and urban poverty lines,
for 50 developing countries and between 1998 and 2007.20
The figure suggests that on the whole, the incidence of
poverty is more than 60 per cent higher in rural than in
urban areas. Specifically, almost half (48.9 per cent) of the
rural population in these countries is below the rural poverty
line, while less than a third (30.3 per cent) of the urban
population is below the urban poverty line. The relatively low
prevalence of urban poverty is largely a result of the fact that
the high costs of non-food items in cities are not considered
in the poverty equation. If the cost of living were factored
in, the prevalence of urban poverty would certainly rise.
At the country level, this positive relationship between
urbanization and poverty holds for all but five countries, or 90
per cent of the cases.21 In other words, the urban-rural poverty
gap is positive in 45 of the 50 countries. In countries such
as Viet Nam and Rwanda, the incidence of poverty in rural
areas is roughly 5 times higher than in urban areas. Other
countries, such as Burundi, show a small gap, as poverty is
widespread in both rural and urban areas. The exceptions are
Sri Lanka and the West Asian countries of Georgia, Armenia
and Azerbaijan, where urban areas feature a higher incidence
of poverty than rural areas. The gap is substantial in the
case of Sri Lanka, where urban poverty is more than three
times higher than rural poverty. However, the relationship
is less pronounced or negligible in the West Asian countries.

While the traditional rural-urban comparison does indeed
reveal that, as a whole, urban populations are better off
than those living in rural areas, this situation conceals some
profound differences in living conditions within urban areas –
a major dimension of the urban divide. When disaggregating
the data at the rural, urban, slum and non-slum levels, it
becomes apparent that there are remarkable similarities
between living conditions in rural areas and slums with

regard to social indicators such as health and education.22
Given the lower incidence of relative poverty in urban areas,
the overall poverty rate (urban and rural) can be expected to
decline as the share of the urban population rises – assuming
that the distribution of income within urban or rural areas
remains unchanged. Urban growth is, therefore, both positive
and necessary for rural poverty reduction. The inverse
relationship between urbanization and poverty is indeed

apparent in trendlines for both, over time and in various
regions of the world (Figure 1.2.8); this is particularly the case
in Eastern Asia, where urbanization has steadily increased and
poverty drastically declined. Cities can be real poverty fighters.
Although less dramatic, the same pattern of rising urbanization
and declining poverty is also evident in Southern Asia. On the
other hand, three regions – Latin America and the Caribbean,
North Africa and the Middle East, and East/Central Europe
and Central Asia – illustrate the dismal legacy of poverty
reduction strategies since the late 20th century. Although the
population became more urban in Latin America and the
Caribbean and North Africa and the Middle East during
the past two decades, the reduction in poverty experienced
during the 1980s came to a halt in the 1990s. A similar
phenomenon occurred in East/Central Europe and Central
Asia, where poverty increased during the 1990s as the degree
of urbanization remained largely unchanged. In sub-Saharan
Africa, a majority of the population will become urban over
the next 30 years and this “urban transition” represents both
an opportunity and a challenge. Local and central authorities
must develop sound policies and strategies to ensure that
urban areas become real engines of national economic
growth, with the potential to reduce poverty and enhance
quality of life for all; otherwise, urban growth will result in a
concentration of poor people in cities instead of rural areas,
and there will be no significant overall poverty reduction.23
Empirical evidence also indicates an inverse relationship
between the degree of urbanization and the overall incidence
of poverty in individual countries: as shown in Figure
1.2.9, countries that are more urbanized tend to feature

lower poverty rates relative to the national poverty line. The
opposite seems to be the case for countries that are little
urbanized, where the incidence of poverty tends to be higher.24
The empirical relationship between urbanization and
poverty does not imply causality – that is, urbanization
per se does not result in overall poverty reduction. More likely,
the relationship between urbanization and poverty reflects a
strong relationship between these two situations and other
factors like pro-poor policies and economic growth. Hand in
hand with economic growth, urbanization has helped reduce
overall poverty by providing new opportunities, raising
incomes and increasing the numbers of livelihood options for
both rural and urban populations. Urbanization, therefore,
does indeed play a positive role in overall poverty reduction,
particularly where supported by well-adapted policies.25
In summary, cities tend to be centres of economic power,
both within local regions and as contributors to the national
economy. Their influence results not only from their share
of the world’s population but also from their location and
economic advantages, including economies of agglomeration
and scale. The prosperity of cities usually mirrors the prosperity
of countries, as an increase in urbanization generally goes hand
in hand with higher GDP per capita, and in some countries
contributes to a decline in overall poverty at the national
level. However, cities can also be places of high inequality, as
increased prosperity often does not result in more egalitarian
distribution of wealth or income. But, does this urban divide
really matter as long as the prosperity of cities results in
poverty reduction? This important question, as well as what
causes inequality, is further explored in Part 2 of this Report.

Box 1.2.1: Is urbanization in Africa “pathological”?

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

In the past two decades, researchers, economists
and analysts have tended to view urbanization in
Africa through a prism of “abnormality” or “exceptionalism”. They have described the continent’s
rapid urban growth – averaging approximately 4
per cent per year in the 1980s and 1990s – as
“pathological” or “dysfunctional”; this suggests
that, unlike the rest of the world, urbanization in
Africa has often not been accompanied by sustained economic growth or reduced poverty. Furthermore, African countries experiencing what has
been termed “urbanization without growth” have
been diagnosed as either “failed states” or underindustrialized, agrarian economies that have been
unable to diversify or improve productivity.
While it is true that economic growth did not keep
pace with rising urban populations in several countries, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, more
recent evidence paints a different picture. A UNHABITAT review of data from 36 African countries
shows that half of the countries, including Angola,
Ethiopia, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique and Sudan,
experienced relatively high (over 5 per cent) economic growth rates in 2006 and 2007, with Angola,
Ethiopia and Sudan growing at double-digit rates of
21.1 per cent, 11.1 per cent, and 10.2 per cent,
respectively. In many of these countries, average
annual urban growth rates between 2005 and
2010 were not significantly higher than the continental average of 3.3 per cent. In fact, in South
Africa and Botswana, where more than 60 per cent
of the population is urban and which featured GDP
growth rates of more than 5 per cent in 2006 and
2007, annual urban growth rates between 2005
and 2010 (estimate) were significantly lower than
the continental average, at 1.35 per cent and 2.51
per cent, respectively. Growth in the formal economy of many African countries has been fuelled
mainly by the industrial (including construction and
mining) and services sectors, which tend to be
urban-based. Of all the economic sectors, including agriculture, the services sector has grown the
fastest in Africa since the 1990s.
Despite robust economic growth in several countries, though, approximately one-third of the 36
African countries under review have experienced
substantial shifts in population without commensurate poverty reduction. Even though just one country experienced negative GDP growth in 2006 and
2007, GDP growth per capita provides a different
perspective. One-third of the countries, including
Burundi, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Togo, featured negative GDP per capita growth rates during
2006 and 2007, with Zimbabwe experiencing the
worst at -6.0 per cent. In some countries, such as
Kenya, relatively high economic growth rates from
2003 to 2007 have been undercut by recent civil

strife and political factors, which hindered economic growth and productivity in 2008 and 2009.
Furthermore, the concerns of outside observers
have been justified by the experiences of many
African countries where high economic growth
rates have not led directly to reductions in slum
populations or urban poverty. This would point to a
pattern of “pathological” urban growth which, fundamentally, reflects a lack of political will to tackle
urban poverty in a systematic way, but can also
derive from the poor performance of policies and
programmes in many countries. As discussed in
Part 2 of this Report, development strategies and
related interventions have, to a large extent, been
dictated by powerful interest groups. In some cases social policies, including those involving donor
assistance, have proved to be extremely ineffective. High slum prevalence in many African cities
can also be attributed to structural and political failures in the distribution of public goods, as well as
to lack of human and financial resources to address
urban poverty. Against this background, economic
growth in many cases has had little impact on either poverty or inequality, or both. In other words,
sustained economic growth has not been in a position to drive the urbanization process with desirable
results. In the fastest growing African economies,
such as oil-rich Angola and Sudan, slum dwellers
constitute the majority – more than 80 per cent
– of the urban population. Poor agricultural yields
and civil war have been blamed for the high urban
and slum growth rates in these countries, as rural
migrants have flocked to cities to escape hunger or
conflict. While natural population growth in African
cities is increasingly the norm (more people are
born in cities than migrate to them), continued civil

strife and environmental crises in some countries
are still pushing rural populations to urban areas,
where the majority of the migrants end up in slums
or poorly-serviced neighbourhoods.
Although rural poverty rates tend to be higher than
those in urban areas, the gap is rapidly closing. In
Kenya, for instance, the urban and rural poverty
rates in 1997 were 49 per cent and 53 per cent, respectively. Projections for 2020 indicate that urban
poverty will account for more than 40 per cent of
total poverty in several African countries, including Benin, Cameroon, Kenya, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania. These projections suggest that rapid urbanization may lead
to a shift in the locus of poverty in Africa from rural
to urban areas, leaving cities with a larger share of
total poverty in the coming decades.
However, statistics often fail to reflect Africa’s underground economies, where the bulk of the urban
population works in the informal sector. In fact,
many African cities that may appear as “a patchwork of shantytowns, refugee camps, industrial
zones and gated residential communities” are actually clusters of economic activities that are linked
through both formal and informal networks. One
study showed that in the years 1999 and 2000,
the informal economy accounted for 42 per cent of
23 African countries’ gross national product (GNP).
Evidence from several African countries has also
shown that the informal economy keeps growing
even as the formal sector is stagnant. It is estimated, for instance, that informal activities account
for 93 per cent of all new jobs and 61 per cent of
urban employment in Africa. Although this largely
invisible economy is not in a position to propel the
continent out of poverty, it plays an important role
in Africa’s urban transformation and development.

Quick Facts	
1.	 The Millennium “slum target” has been
achieved, improving the lives of 227 million
people, but only because it was set too low at
the outset; 100 million was only 10 per cent of
the global slum population.
2.	 China and India alone achieved the global slum
target by improving the lives of 125 million
slum dwellers.
3.	 North Africa is the only sub-region in the
developing world where both the number
and proportion of slum dwellers have steadily
declined.
4.	 No single country has managed to halve
their slum populations. The more successful
(Indonesia, Morocco, Argentina, Colombia,
Egypt, Dominican Republic) reduced slum
incidence by 30 to nearly 50 per cent.

Policy Points	

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

1.	 The population of slum dwellers around the
world continues to grow at around 10 per
cent every year, intensifying the problem
worldwide.

30

2.	 Unless governments adopt ambitious, welldevised targets for their own countries and
allocate adequate budget resources, the
lives of slum dwellers will effectively remain
unchanged.
3.	 Individual countries must revise and increase
the slum target to take into account both
existing and potential new slums. This is an
essential building block if the urban divide is to
be bridged.
4.	 Countries and cities that take the slum target
seriously are increasing the prospects for
millions to escape poverty, disease and
illiteracy, and simply to lead better lives.
5.	 Countries that have managed substantially to
reduce their own slum populations give hope
to others and show that adequate policies can
bring positive change.
6.	 Improving the lives of slum dwellers is the best
way to achieve all the Millennium Development
Goals. Improving housing conditions and
providing for water and sanitation will not only
save lives among the very poor, but will also
support progress in education and health.

Slum Dwellers:

Proportions are Declining,
but Numbers are Growing

Good news on the slum target,
Millennium Development Goal 7

T

he living conditions of slum dwellers have made
bleak news for years, shedding the crudest - and
cruelest - light on the urban divide. In 2006,
UN-HABITAT reported that thousands of
people were joining the ranks of the slum population every
month in the towns and cities of developing countries, where
one in every three residents already lived in a slum.1 Along
with new data on the global slum population, UN-HABITAT
presented a “worst-case” slum scenario, in which growth rates
were projected to continue unabated with the number of
residents rising from nearly one billion in 2005 to 1.4 billion
by 2020.2
At the time, the data put the urban divide under sharp
focus and sparked fresh interest in slums. The outcome was
a series of reports and publications predicting increasingly
desperate situations for the world’s slum dwellers. Since
the growth in urban populations in developing countries is
often characterized by informality, illegality and unplanned
settlements, and is, above all, strongly associated with urban
poverty, many authors assumed that urban growth in the
poorest countries would be synonymous with slum growth.
Fortunately, though, a number of countries have, to a
significant extent, managed to curb the further expansion of
slums and to improve the living conditions prevailing there.
This suggests that the world can reduce the urban divide and
steer away from the worst-case scenario for urban growth.
Since the year 2000, when the international community
committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and associated targets, the global effort to narrow the starkest,
slum-related form of urban divide has yielded some positive
results. United Nations data suggests that the overarching
goal of reducing absolute poverty by half can be achieved,
although higher food prices in the last year may push 100
million people deeper into poverty.3 When, under Goal 7,
target 11 (as the slum target was originally known), member
states pledged significantly to improve the lives of at least
100 million slum dwellers by 2020, they could not have
known that the target would be achieved 10 years ahead of
schedule.4

Regional Trends
Many countries and regions have narrowed the urban divide
through significant reductions in both the numbers and
proportions of slum dwellers, but some are lagging behind
or, worse, are actually regressing. As shown in Map 1.3.2,
Asia was at the forefront of successful efforts to reach the
Millennium slum target between the year 2000 and 2010, with
governments in the region improving the lives of an estimated
172 million slum dwellers; these represent 75 per cent of the
total number of urban residents in the world who no longer
suffer from inadequate housing. The greatest advances in this
region were recorded in Southern and Eastern Asia, where
145 million people moved out of the “slum dweller” category
(73 million and 72 million, respectively); this represented a

24 per cent decrease in the total urban population living in
slums in the two sub-regions. Countries in South-Eastern Asia
have also made significant progress with improved conditions
for 33 million slum residents, or a 22 per cent decrease.
Only Western Asia has failed to make a contribution as the
number of slum dwellers in the sub-region increased by 12
million. This setback can largely be attributed to the conflictrelated deterioration of living conditions in Iraq, where the
proportion of urban residents living in slum conditions has
tripled from 17 per cent in the year 2000 (2.9 million) to an
estimated 53 per cent in 2010 (10.7 million).
Across Africa, the lives of 24 million slum dwellers have
improved in the last decade, representing 11 per cent of the
global effort to narrow this form of urban divide. North
Africa has made significant gains (see Map 1.3.3), with
improved conditions for 8.7 million. In sub-Saharan Africa,
though, the proportion of the urban population living in
slums has decreased by only 5 per cent (or 17 million); as for
the future, data suggest persistent challenges as growth rates
remain high for both urban and slum populations (estimated
at slightly less than 4 per cent on an annual basis). Every year,
10 million more people are added to the urban population
of sub-Saharan Africa; approximately one-third of these, or 3
million, move to “formal” urban areas and act both as agents
and beneficiaries of formal urban and economic growth.
The remaining two-thirds, or 7 million, live in informal
settlements or slum conditions. Of these, only 2 million can
expect to lift themselves out of the slum conditions where the
other 5 million will remain confined on the wrong side of the
urban divide.
Some 13 per cent of the progress made towards the global
Millennium slum target has occurred in Latin America and
the Caribbean, where 30 million people have moved out of
slum conditions since the year 2000. In proportional terms,
the reduction is 19.5 per cent. This leaves Latin America
lagging behind North Africa for improved slum conditions,
while remaining far ahead of sub-Saharan Africa, where the
slum-induced urban divide remains stark (Map 1.3.4).
On a global scale, the overall outlook is cause for optimism.
The fact that an additional 227 million urban dwellers have
gained access to improved water and sanitation as well as
to durable and less crowded housing shows that a number
of countries and cities are taking the slum target seriously.
This enhances the prospects for millions of people to escape
poverty, disease and illiteracy, and to lead better lives thanks to
a narrower urban divide.

UN-HABITAT slum indicators
A slum household consists of one or a group of individuals living under
the same roof in an urban area, lacking one or more of the following
five amenities: (1) durable housing (a permanent structure providing
protection from extreme climatic conditions); (2) sufficient living area
(no more than three people sharing a room); (3) access to improved
water (water that is sufficient, affordable and can be obtained without
extreme effort); (4) access to improved sanitation facilities (a private

toilet, or a public one shared with a reasonable number of people);
and (5) secure tenure (de facto or de jure secure tenure status and
protection against forced eviction). Since information on secure
tenure is not available for most countries included in the UN-HABITAT
database, however, only the first four indicators are used to define slum
households, and then to estimate the proportion of the urban population
living in slums.

Slum Dwellers: Proportions are Declining, but Numbers are Growing

According to UN-HABITAT estimates, between the year
2000 and 2010 a total 227 million people in the developing
world will have moved out of slum conditions. In other words,
governments have collectively exceeded the Millennium
target by at least 2.2 times.
Not only have slum dwellers experienced significant
improvements in their day-to-day lives, but millions have
also ceased being slum dwellers under the UN-HABITAT
definition (see Box below). Another reason to rejoice is
that all regions in the developing world have contributed
to this success, even though some countries have been more
successful than others.
While the world has reason to celebrate this welcome overall
dent in the urban divide, there is no room for complacency.
More than 200 million slum dwellers do enjoy better living
conditions today than they did 10 years ago, but their absolute
number in the developing world is not on the decline, quite
the contrary: the number of slum dwellers in the developing
world has risen from 767 million in the year 2000 to an
estimated 828 million in 2010 (see Table and Map 1.3.1).
This means that 61 million new slum dwellers have been
added to the global urban population since the year 2000.
Current UN-HABITAT estimates confirm that the progress
made on the slum target has not been enough to counter the
growth of informal settlements in the developing world. In
this sense, efforts to reduce the number of slum dwellers and the urban divide at its most unacceptable - are neither
satisfactory nor adequate, especially when considering that
50.6 per cent of the world’s population - or 3.49 billion - now
live in urban areas.5

instability and conflict have deteriorated basic
service provision and shelter conditions in cities,
resulting in a high prevalence of slums.
The same holds in Iraq and Lebanon, with refugees and displaced persons compounding the
situation. Elsewhere in Western Asia, Yemen
features the highest proportion of people living
below the national poverty line, at 41 per cent;
65 per cent of households are classified as slum
dwellers, and 26.4 per cent suffer from multiple
shelter deprivations.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, Guatemala,
Haiti, Nicaragua and Bolivia feature the highest
proportions of slum households. In Haiti and Bolivia,
more than half of these suffer from multiple shelter

MDG Progress in Individual Countries
Some countries have made substantial progress and are
clearly moving ahead not only in slum reduction but also
in slum prevention. In absolute numbers, China and India
have improved the lives of more slum dwellers than any
other country, having together lifted no less than 125 million
people out of slum conditions between the year 2000 and
2010 (estimate) (see Figure 1.3.1).
In this resolute effort to bridge the urban divide over
the past decade, China has recorded the most spectacular
progress in the world, with improvements to the day-today conditions of 65.3 million urban residents who were
living with one or more factors of shelter deprivation. In
proportional terms, China’s urban slum population fell from
37.3 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 28.2 per cent
in 2010, a 25 per cent relative decrease (see Figure 1.3.2).

economic growth, China has managed to improve living

conditions through economic reforms and modernization
policies that have used urbanization as a propelling force
of national growth. Pro-growth policies, with targeted propoor dimensions, have generally resulted in a reduction in
the number of slum dwellings. More significantly, targeted
programmes directed at old villages within the boundaries of
expanding cities and newly developed slums (which provide
cheap housing for the more than 8 million migrant workers
who flock to the cities every year) have mixed both regulation
and development mechanisms to prompt modernization - and
have met success. A particularly successful strategy has been
facilitating access of slum dwellers to more than 20 million
new and affordable housing units through government equity
grants (as a mortgage instrument). These procure leases on
cheap housing built by property developers, who are given
preferential tax rates as an incentive for the development of
affordable homes. On top of this, a new tier of self-governance
seems to also have emerged in the new housing estates, with
residents electing committees to oversee and manage urban
safety and security, environmental conservation and the needs
of young and elderly people.6
Like China, India has been successful in improving the
lives of slum dwellers, having helped 59.7 million of these
out of dire conditions since the year 2000. Slum prevalence
fell from 41.5 per cent in 2000 to an estimated 28.1 per
cent in 2010, a relative decrease of 32 per cent. India has
taken up urban poverty alleviation and slum improvement
as important components of its urban development policies
through four specific strategies: (1) enhancing the productivity
of the urban poor by building skills and providing access to
micro-credit; (2) improving the living conditions of the poor
through provision of basic services and in-situ development
of slum settlements; (3) providing security of tenure to poor
families living in unauthorized settlements and improving
their access to serviced low-cost housing and subsidized
housing finance; and (4) empowering the urban poor
through community development and encouraging their
participation in decision-making.7

decade by over a third. Haiti, Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala
and Peru achieved reductions ranging from 21 to 27 per
cent. Brazil managed to reduce its slum population by 16 per
cent. Other countries in the region have been less successful,
achieving only negligible progress toward the Millennium
target and a narrower urban divide.
Latin America’s four most populated countries - Argentina,
Colombia, Mexico and Brazil - account for 79 per cent of
the region’s estimated improvements in the lives of slum
dwellers. Among these, Argentina and Colombia have
proved the more successful, reducing by two-fifths their slum
population thanks to improved housing and better access
to water and sanitation. As it emerged from the economic
crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, Argentina managed
to improve the lives of nearly five million people residing in
slum neighbourhoods, significantly reducing the prevalence
of invasiones (as slums are known locally). In Colombia, an
estimated 3.7 million slum dwellers have benefited from welltargeted slum upgrading and prevention strategies, lowering
slum prevalence from 22.3 per cent in the year 2000 to an
estimated 13.5 per cent in 2010. Mexico made fair progress
with improved conditions for five million slum dwellers
in the last decades, as slum prevalence dropped from 19.9
per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 14.4 per cent in
2010. Brazil, the world’s 10th largest economy, was able to
improve the living conditions of an estimated 10.4 million
people between the year 2000 and 2010, as slum incidence
regressed from 31.5 to 26.4 per cent. The main factors behind
Brazil’s success include economic and social policies that have
improved incomes for poor urban households; a decreasing
population growth rate and slowing rural-urban migration;
the development of low-income housing policies that subsidize
construction material costs, sites and services, and provide for
slum upgrading and land tenure regularization; new social
housing and urban infrastructure projects; the creation of
a Ministry of Cities; and the adoption of a constitutional
amendment safeguarding citizens’ right to housing.9

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

After China and India, the most significant improvements
in slum conditions in Asia were recorded in Indonesia, Viet
Nam and Turkey. In South-East Asia, Indonesia improved the
lives of 21.2 million slum dwellers, a 33 per cent proportional
decrease (from 34.4 per cent of the urban population in the
year 2000 to an estimated 23 per cent in 2010). Turkey scored
as the best-performing country in Western Asia, reducing its
proportion of slum households by slightly less than one-third,
from 17.9 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 12.4 per
cent in 2010. Another country that managed to narrow the
urban divide was Viet Nam, where slum incidence dropped
from 48.8 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 33.7 per
cent in 2010 - a 30.9 per cent decrease. This is commensurate
with poverty reduction over the same period,8 and it is worth
noting here that Viet Nam has also made significant progress
on most of the other Millennium Development Goals.
The more successful developing countries are found in
North Africa. Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia have achieved
the most substantial reductions in the proportions of people
living with shelter deprivations. In Morocco, an estimated 2.4
million people moved out of slum conditions over the past 10
years, reflecting a 45.8 per cent reduction in slum prevalence
between the year 2000 (24.2 per cent) and 2010 (an estimated
13 per cent), thanks to strong political leadership, clear targets
and adequate budget resources. Egypt reduced its proportion
of slum dwellers by 39 per cent, as slum prevalence fell from
28.1 per cent of the urban population in the year 2000 to an
estimated 17.1 per cent in 2010, in the process improving
living conditions for five million people. Such significant
narrowing of the urban divide in Morocco and Egypt alone
accounted for two-thirds of North Africa’s progress.
Among other major regions of the world, Latin America
and the Caribbean has made relatively good progress on
the slum target. However, aggregate figures conceal the
region’s heterogeneity. Argentina, Colombia and Dominican
Republic, the most successful countries in the region, were
able to reduce their proportions of slum dwellers in the last

BUT OTHERS ARE ONLY “RECLASSIFIED” VILLAGES
ford public services. Efforts must also ensure that
durable, properly sized land and housing is affordable
and accessible to poor families so that they can also
afford health care, education and other essential
services.

The prevalence of slum households varies dramatically across cities of the developing world. In
some, a relatively small percentage of households
experience shelter deprivations, or many experience only one barrier to adequate housing. In
other cities, a majority of households live in dwellings that lack two or more basic shelter amenities, threatening the health, safety and well-being
of residents.
Slums in the cities of many sub-Saharan African
countries have become notorious for the extent
and intensity of their deprivations, and yet living conditions for people in housing classified as
“slums” are not uniformly alarming. Indeed, the divide between slums and more conventional urban
environments seems so narrow as to be relatively
easy to bridge - if only policymakers recognized
the opportunity and acted accordingly. Indeed, in
a number of sub-Saharan African cities, some of
the living conditions that prompted concern in the
past are undergoing noteworthy improvement; in
some places, slum households now are only one
or two basic amenities short of “adequate” housing. In Southern Africa, countries like Namibia and
Zimbabwe feature the relatively low slum concentrations that can also be observed in middle-income countries of Asia and Latin America and the
Caribbean. In the Southern Africa sub-region, it
could take a simple programme targeting housing

or sanitation to help many families out of slums,
enabling them fully to enjoy urban life with all their
basic shelter needs met. In South Africa, for example, 3 out of 10 urban homes are “slum households”, and as many as 22 per cent of households
suffer from only one shelter deprivation - primarily
lack of improved sanitation (10 per cent) or of sufficient living area (9 per cent).
Because no universal pattern of shelter deprivations or types of slums is evident across the cities of the developing world, there is no universal
prescription for slum improvement. In all of the
cities where the urban landscape is dominated by
slums, improving the lives of slum dwellers first
requires the implementation of macro-economic
programmes that can lift households from deprivation to adequate living standards, providing
for the missing elements in their environments:
housing infrastructure and finance, improved
water, improved sanitation, or durable housing
units with adequate living space. However, these
macro-level programmes must be associated
with micro-level schemes, including micro-credit,
self-help, education and employment. Housing
services may be available, but families will use
them only if they are affordable. Moreover, urban
infrastructure projects, when focused on slum
upgrading, should include economic development
and employment programmes if families are to af-

Planning for growth can be particularly difficult
where “cities” are actually just agglomerations
of contiguous settlements that feature the same
densities as those of more typical urban areas, but
are administered independently. Such fragmented
urban areas may not provide the infrastructure
and economic activities that make cities liveable
and viable. In some places, even areas where rural activities are predominant can be classified as
“cities” the moment they meet certain population
thresholds. In Mali and Madagascar, for example,
any place with a population of 5,000 inhabitants or
more qualifies as “urban”. The reclassification of
a location from rural area to “city” or “town” can
imply the presence of administrative institutions,
such as a city council in charge of planning, land
allocation and provision of basic services; however, development of such much-needed amenities as sewerage systems and housing schemes
to ensure access to adequate dwellings often
does not follow, leaving small cities and towns as
deprived as villages or rural communities. Clearly,
creating “urban” places without adequate infrastructure for the resident population densities is a
recipe for slum cities.

Slums are often viewed as the result of poor management of demographic growth on the part of
major cities, but cities of all sizes struggle with
the inability to provide adequate affordable land
and housing and the extended water supplies and
sanitation facilities needed to serve expanding
populations. Slums can be easier to improve in
smaller than in larger cities, as small cities often
feature fewer social, cultural and economic barriers to urban development. In small cities, developing master plans and engaging in urban planning
with the participation of families and communities
is often more straightforward than in large cities,
and institutions can be more easily coordinated to
implement services. In cities of all sizes, improving the lives of slum dwellers and bridging the urban divide depends on increased development of
non-agricultural sectors, services and industries
for sustainable urbanization, providing access to
well-paid jobs, formal land and housing policies
as well as structured credit.

Slum target reached, but the numbers keep growing

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

The year 2010 marks the halfway point towards the deadline
for the “slum target”. In their efforts to improve the lives of
at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020, the governments
of the world have already collectively exceeded the target
by more than two times. Part 2 of this Report shows how
improvements in housing can also have an impact on access
to health, education and job opportunities for those living in
slum neighbourhoods.
Over the past 10 years, the proportion of the urban
population living in slums in the developing world has
declined from 39 per cent in the year 2000 to an estimated
32 per cent in 2010. And yet the urban divide still exists,
because in absolute terms the numbers of slum dwellers have
actually grown considerably, and will continue to rise in the
near future. Therefore, the fact that the world as a whole has
reached the Millennium slum target 10 years in advance does
not mean that efforts to improve the lives of slum dwellers
should slow down or altogether stop. Rather, the fact that the
target was reached this early makes it quite clear that it was
simply set too low.
In the developing world between the year 2000 and 2010,
the urban population is estimated to have increased by an
average of 58 million per year. During the same period, the
absolute number of slum dwellers is reckoned to have increased
by nearly half this number (28 million) every year. UNHABITAT estimates that in developing countries, 22 million
people have been lifted out of slum conditions every year over
that decade, through slum upgrading or prevention.

This means that an average of 6 million people became slum
dwellers every year. These estimations show that nearly half of
the urban growth in the developing world can be attributed to
slum expansion (48 per cent) and a significant proportion of
it is improved over time (38 per cent), but still about 10 per
cent of this informal growth remains in deprived conditions
every year.
Simple projections extrapolating data from the previous
decade show that by 2020, and short of drastic action to curb
current trends, the slum population worldwide is likely to
grow annually by 6 million every year, or another 61 million
people, to reach a total of 889 million by 2020.
New slum estimates presented in Table 1.3.1 show that
today, nearly a third (32.7 per cent) of the urban population in
developing regions live in the inadequate housing conditions
that are a major aspect of the urban divide. In particular,
the projections for slum reduction in sub-Saharan Africa,
where approximately 61.7 per cent of urban residents are
slum dwellers, are as not as optimistic as for other regions
of the world. The precarious nature of the development
pathway of sub-Saharan Africa appears clearly in a number
of trends that have to do not just with slums but also with
other development and urban divide indicators such as infant
and maternal mortality, employment and hunger. Despite the
efforts of some countries and cities to expand basic services
and improve housing conditions in slum areas, inaction by
others has prevented overall progress from keeping pace with
a rapidly increasing urban population. In the past decade, the
number of urban residents in the sub-region increased by some
100 million, slightly more than half (55 million) of whom
were new slum dwellers, while another 16 million moved from
the “slum dweller” to the “urban non-slum resident” category.
This means that while the proportion of the urban population
living in slums underwent a moderate reduction (from 65 per
cent in the year 2000 to an estimated 61.7 per cent in 2010),
the actual slum population increased in absolute numbers by
five million every year. The data provides no evidence that this
pattern, and the urban divide that comes with it, will change,
and it is likely that nearly half of the growth in sub-Saharan
Africa’s urban population will take place against a background
of poverty and deprivation between now and 2020.
In Benin, Ethiopia, Malawi and other countries that
rank among the lowest on the Human Development Index
compiled by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), slum prevalence is expected to remain at a very
high 70 per cent. The future is not looking bright for conflictaffected countries in sub-Saharan Africa, either: in Central
African Republic and Côte d’Ivoire, the proportion of
slum dwellers has increased by around one-tenth. The most
conspicuous case of slum population increase was observed in
Zimbabwe, with a surge (from 3.3 to 17.9 per cent) resulting
from massive forced evictions in 2005. These have added to
the numbers of people living in overcrowded conditions, and
a deteriorating economy has also had severe effects on the
country’s urban poor.

Box 1.3.3: Women bear the brunt of problems associated with slum life
The vast Kibera settlement in Nairobi receives
much media attention as one of the largest,
most densely populated slums in Africa, but
there are surprisingly few comprehensive studies
with reliable statistics relating specifically to the
women who live there. Much of the documentation
about women in Kibera is based on case studies,
interviews and qualitative analysis.
Kibera is a vast slum located approximately seven
kilometres southwest of Nairobi’s city centre. A
large concentration of women live there in what
can easily be described as the worst conditions
slums have to offer. The slum is characterized
by severe poverty, poor access to clean water,
overflowing open sewers, huge heaps of rubbish,
overly crowded mud houses, constant threat of
eviction, and widespread criminality, delinquency
and unemployment.

Indeed, research by the Centre on Housing Rights
and Evictions (COHRE) found that: “Informal
settlements in Nairobi are … often home to
thousands of women who were driven by inlaws out of their rural and urban homes and land
upon the death of their husbands. In two separate
missions to Kenya, as well as through research on
women’s inheritance rights in sub-Saharan Africa,
COHRE found that family pressure, social stigma,
physical threats and often extreme violence
directed at the widow force her to seek shelter
elsewhere.”
The study reinforces findings from numerous
others showing that widows are particularly
vulnerable to eviction because of customary and
traditional practices in sub-Saharan Africa that
override international commitments, such as
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women. Such practices
often compromise the rights of Kenyan widows to
keep their land and housing when disputes with
in-laws arise. Property grabbing from widows
whose husbands have died of AIDS is also
reportedly widespread and is one of the factors
that push women to migrate to Kibera.

Because of their low incomes, these women
have few housing alternatives when or if they
are evicted. There is also some evidence to
suggest that single, unmarried mothers in
informal settlements such as Kibera have the
poorest choice in housing since many landlords
are unwilling to rent to them, believing them to be
unreliable tenants.
The burden of women’s domestic roles in Kibera
also puts them at more of a disadvantage
when basic services like water, sanitation and
electricity are lacking. Like women in many
parts of the developing world, those in Kibera
are usually responsible for water collection and
management of waste in the home. Long queues
of women waiting with rows of yellow jerrycans
are a common sight in the slum. Up to 85 per cent
of women in Kibera draw water from private and
community-owned water kiosks.
As in other slums where sanitation facilities are
poor or non-existent, going to the toilet at night
or in the early morning is a considerable security
concern for women. Because they have to venture
down narrow, unlit alleyways, many would rather
use a plastic bag (the so-called “flying toilets”)
rather than braving the dark and the inherent risk
of rape and sexual harassment.
Compared with men, who are more likely to
secure work outside the slum, women spend
more time around the home and are more likely

than males to take care of household waste.
In doing so, they are exposed to environmental
hazards such as breathing in harmful fumes
from the burning of rubbish, which add to the
health risks they already experience by cooking
indoors with charcoal, kerosene or firewood in the
absence of electricity or cheaper fuel.
Even if women do not get sick themselves,
their unpaid labour when caring for people with
diarrhoea (leading killer of children under 5 - and
malaria, both of which are exacerbated by lack
of improved sewerage) takes time away from
education or income-generating activities.
The Kenya Water for Health Organization estimates
that the average household in Kibera comprises
seven people, and that many households
are female-headed. A 10-by-10 square foot
dwelling for seven people is indicative of severe
overcrowding and its attendant problems, such
as lack of privacy, ease of disease transmission
- especially respiratory infections - and increased
risk of “negative social behaviour patterns”, such
as domestic violence and child abuse. The cycle
of violence continues outside the home as well:
poverty often pushes girls in slums to engage in
risky sexual behaviour or prostitution in exchange
for food, shelter, gifts, or cash. As a result, HIV
infection in the slum remains extraordinarily high,
with estimates as high as 20 per cent - more than
twice the national average.

Slum Dwellers: Proportions are Declining, but Numbers are Growing

Although men in Kibera also suffer from problems
associated with slum life, numerous studies on
informal settlements in the region suggest that
women bear the brunt of problems brought on
by inadequate housing and insecure tenure.
Unequal power relations between women
and men generally leave Kibera women at a
disadvantage in areas such as accessing land,
property and other productive resources, and
securing remunerated work.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

North Africa is the only sub-region in the developing world
where both the number and the proportion of slum dwellers
have been steadily declining since the year 2000. Despite
an urban growth rate of 2.4 per cent10 (or an additional 2.2
million urban dwellers every year) over the past decade, the
share of slum dwellers in the sub-region fell from 20 per cent
to an estimated 13.3 per cent over the same period, or about
2.9 million in absolute numbers. This substantial reduction
in the urban divide can be attributed to effective government
policies for slum upgrading and prevention.
Asian cities are host to an estimated 61 per cent of all the
slum dwellers in the developing world. In Southern Asia, the
poorest sub-region, more than one-third (35 per cent) of the
urban population experiences at least one shelter deprivation
as defined by UN-HABITAT. The sub-region also features
the highest incidences of infant mortality and other social
problems in Asia.11 Fifty-three per cent of the slum dwellers
in Southern Asia, or 103 million people, are concentrated in
India, the most populated country in the sub-region. Despite
India’s substantial reduction in slum prevalence, projections
are that the slum population in Southern Asia will still grow
by some half million per year, totaling 200 million by 2020.
This is even more likely as economic growth rates are slightly
declining in India.12 In Bangladesh, slum prevalence remains
very high at 70 per cent. Regional spillovers from the global
financial crisis are also likely to cut into government revenues
and concomitant abilities to invest in the delivery of housing
and basic services that are essential to narrowing the urban
divide.
South-Eastern Asia features the second-highest rate of
slum prevalence in the region (an estimated 31 per cent in
2010). For all the achievements of countries like Indonesia,
Viet Nam and, to some extent, the Philippines, where slum
growth has decelerated significantly, other social indicators
such as maternal mortality remain unacceptably high13 in the
sub-region as a whole. This is primarily a result of conditions
prevailing in Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic
and Myanmar, where slum prevalence is high and development
indicators point to low quality of life. Improvements in the
lives of slum dwellers take longer in South-Eastern Asia; by
current trends and short of drastic action, the number of
residents in slum areas is to grow by slightly more than 2
million every year, reaching 109 million by 2020. It is also
likely that urban poverty, and the urban divide, will increase
in some of the South-Eastern Asian emerging economies
that have been severely affected by the collapse in demand
for consumer durable goods and the deterioration of global
financial conditions; both of these could result in more
victims of shelter deprivations in the coming years.
In Eastern Asia, 28.2 per cent of the urban population
dwell in slums. More than 90 per cent of Eastern Asia’s slum
dwellers, or 171 million, live in China. In fact, China is
home to a full one-fifth of the world’s slum population - the
same as the country’s share in the global population. Thanks
to China’s own significant achievements, Eastern Asia as a
whole has reduced slum incidence by an estimated 25 per

cent. However, in view of ongoing rapid urban growth, it
is anticipated that the number of slum dwellers in the subregion will continue to increase by a total 30 million over the
next 10 years, reaching 219 million by 2020. In countries
with liberalized open economies and a high dependence on
external demand, such as Korea, unemployment and poverty
may increase as a result of the global financial crisis, making
the conditions of those already living with shelter deprivations
even worse.
The proportion of slum dwellers in Western Asia should
be relatively low by 2010, at an estimated 24.6 per cent of
the urban population. In terms of slum prevention, however,
the sub-region has made little progress, owing to deteriorating
living conditions in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan. The slum
population in the sub-region has grown by more than half
since the year 2000 (from 23 million to 36 million), as a
consequence of ongoing political turmoil, a related increase
in the refugee population, and disruptions in the delivery of
basic services and housing. The implications of the region’s
instability are also evident in other Millennium Development
Goal indicators, such as the high proportion of underweight
children under 5 and the high maternal mortality rate - two
indicators on which Western Asia has made little progress
compared with other developing regions.14 Against this
background, Turkey stands out for having reduced by slightly
less than one-third its slum population and improved the
lives of nearly 3.5 million people over the last 10 years; no
other country has contributed more to MDG compliance
in Western Asia. Turkey has achieved this by systematically
legitimizing self-built housing, allowing for in-situ upgrading,
and providing public transport and basic service infrastructure
to informal settlements in the largest cities. In recent years,
however, forced evictions and “urban renewal” strategies in
some Turkish cities have replaced informal housing with
large-scale estates that have resulted in the displacement
of the poorest residents.15 If the Western Asia sub-region
remains engulfed in conflicts and various forms of instability,
it is likely that the existing urban divide, as reflected in high
numbers of slum dwellers, will be there to stay, growing by
around 24 million to reach 48 million in the next 20 years.
Latin America and the Caribbean experienced a significant
(20 per cent) reduction in the proportion of slum dwellers
in its urban population over the last decade. However, slum
incidence remains relatively high: 23 out of 100 urban residents
in the region live in tugurios, favelas or campamentos, as the
precarious settlements are locally known. The region is quite
heterogeneous in terms of human development indicators
and slum incidence. Haiti, the poorest country in the region
and one of the poorest in the world, has a slum prevalence
of 70 per cent. Bolivia and Nicaragua similarly feature very
high slum prevalence, with nearly every other urban resident
living in informal neighbourhoods that lack one or more
basic services. Approximately one-third of the total urban
population in Peru and Guatemala live in slums, compared
with roughly one-quarter in Argentina and Brazil. Elsewhere
in the region, slum incidence is low in Colombia, Dominican

Republic and Mexico, with less than 15 per cent of the urban
population living in slums; the lowest proportions are found
in Chile and several Caribbean countries, where the urban
divide is less pronounced.
Latin America exhibits the greatest inequalities in the
distribution of welfare and wealth in the developing world.
However, between 2002 and 2006, the region achieved
significant social and economic progress. Generally speaking,
poverty and unemployment have been reduced; in some
countries, income gaps have narrowed and job numbers
increased, underlying the current positive trend in the region.
According to the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean, poverty decreased by more than 4 per cent
between 2002 and 2006.16 The current global financial crisis
and the 2008 food crisis may reverse some of these trends,
and could particularly affect health and education services
for the very poor. The potential effect on slum indicators

and the urban divide is difficult to estimate, but the trends
of the past two decades suggest that the slum population in
Latin America and the Caribbean will, like Southern Asia’s,
continue to grow by half a million people every year, reaching
120 million by 2020.
Slums: The need for a higher goal and a more
realistic target
Because of the many cross-currents behind urban,
demographic and policy realities, another 172 million
people have become slum dwellers even as, 10 years ahead
of the 2020 deadline, the world collectively exceeded by a
wide margin the 100 million reduction target set under
Millennium Development Goal 7, target 11. The number of
urban residents living in slum conditions is now estimated at
some 828 million.

Slums have only on occasion proved to be what
most public authorities wished they would: a
transient phenomenon, which growth and higher
incomes would eliminate over time. In too many
cities today, all-too visible slums remain blind
spots for policymakers - caught as they are
between token gestures, clearance or mass
eviction, or administrative “pass the buck”. The
odd attempt at institutional response and reform
typically founders on lack of support, funding or
coordination. Still, municipalities in a number of
countries (representing about one-third of those
known as “developing”) have managed to reduce
the absolute and relative numbers of slumdwellers among their populations.

46

How did they do it? The successful
governments took the responsibility for slum
reduction squarely on their shoulders, backing
commitments with bold policy reforms, and
preventing future slum growth with equitable
planning and economic policies. Recent
policy evidence collected by UN-HABITAT in
44 successful countries suggests that slum
reduction takes a combination of five specific,
complementary approaches: (1) awareness and
advocacy; (2) long-term political commitment;
(3) policy reforms and institutional strengthening;
(4) implementation and monitoring; (5) and
scaling-up of successful local projects.
Awareness and advocacy. For local
authorities and other stakeholders, awareness
requires slum monitoring systems and indicators
to collect information and analyse trends, like
those that have been successful throughout Viet
Nam, Brazil and Indonesia. Advocacy involves
disseminating messages on improved living
conditions for slum dwellers, as governments

in Brazil, India and Mexico have done. Civil
society organizations can also encourage political
commitment and champion the views and
rights of slum dwellers and the poor in general
- either as watchdogs like Réseau Social Watch
Bénin that monitor Millennium Development
Goals and poverty reduction strategies, or as
partners in government-funded programmes, like
Mexico’s Hábitat y Rescate de Espacios Públicos
(Reappropriation of public space). Organizations
like Shack/Slum Dwellers International on
occasion perform both an advocacy and an
executing role.
Long-term political commitment. Over the
past 15 years, consistent political commitment
to large-scale slum upgrading and service
provision to the urban poor has enabled China,
India, Turkey, Dominican Republic, Colombia,
Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia to reduce and
stabilize slums. Other countries, including Ghana,
Senegal and Argentina have fairly recently
stepped up action, and yet others have begun
to gather the necessary political support for land
and tenure policy reforms, including Burkina
Faso, Senegal and Tanzania.
Policy reform and institutional
strengthening. The policy reforms required
for slum upgrading and prevention involve
housing, land and infrastructure provision and
finance. Indonesia, Nicaragua and Peru have
integrated large numbers of urban poor into
the legal and social fabric; other countries, like
India, have deployed major pro-poor reforms
and programmes for land and housing provision
or are adopting more inclusive approaches.
Costa Rica, Ecuador and Colombia look to avoid
relocations and instead work on settlements in
situ, improving existing living conditions. Most
of the more successful countries - including
Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa
and Turkey - look beyond the housing sector
and fight slums as part of broader-ranging urban
poverty reduction strategies. Policies have tended
to shift from entitlement to co-participation,
where financial viability and down-payments
condition access to public subsidies for both new
housing and improvements. Creation of a Human
Settlements Ministry gives higher visibility and
continuity to the cause as demonstrated in
Burkina Faso. Municipal decentralization through
community-based consultation mechanisms is
another avenue that has succeeded in Cambodia,
Malawi and Zambia.

Implementation and monitoring. Countries
that performed well on the Millennium slum
target (including Indonesia and South Korea)
deployed transparent and pro-poor policies
backed up by adequate human and technical
resources. Others, such as Colombia, Chile,
the Philippines and South Africa, also trained
urban planning and management professionals
and involved them in housing and basic
service delivery programmes. The most
successful countries (China, Viet Nam, Chile,
Sri Lanka and Peru) coordinated slum policy
implementation between central regional and
municipal authorities and the private sector.
Other countries set themselves national targets:
Cambodia (100 slum communities upgraded
every year); Chile, Brazil, Morocco and Thailand
(all of which enacted clear slum targets and
benchmarks as part of urban poverty reduction).
Indonesia uses results-based monitoring and
satisfaction surveys.
Scaling-up. Replication and scaling-up of
successful, local one-off or pilot slum-upgrading
projects have served Brazil, Mexico, Colombia,
South Africa, Sri Lanka and Indonesia well with
measurable impacts on national indicators
of slum growth. As originally modest-scale
programmes were upgraded in Brazil, Egypt,
Nicaragua and Turkey, the private sector and
civil society became involved, or the schemes
benefited from additional funding for replication
and mainstreaming into government policies. In
Burkina Faso and Senegal, reforms started in the
1980s in the capital city and expanded into largescale physical and tenure upgrading schemes
for irregular settlements across the country.
Other countries, including China, Chile and South
Africa, engaged in large-scale public subsidies to
the housing sector, in a bid to reach the poorest
groups and meet the rising costs of social
housing. In most cases, success mobilized huge
domestic (and, on occasion, external) resources
to promote innovative strategies, including for
slum prevention.
Policy analysis shows that on top of a
combination of these five elements, success
on the Millennium slum target involves proper
coordination between cohesive, well-designed
and adequately resourced centralized
interventions on the one hand, and local
authorities on the other hand.

Slum Dwellers: Proportions are Declining, but Numbers are Growing

When the international community adopted the
Millennium Declaration and implicitly endorsed the
“Cities without Slums” target in the year 2000,17 experts in
development agencies thought that 100 million was both a
significant number and a realistic target within 20 years. By
2003, though, when UN-HABITAT - the agency in charge
of monitoring the “Cities without Slums” target - made a
first estimate of the global slum population, it appeared that
100 million represented only about 10 per cent of that total,
which in 2001 stood at over 900 million.
Even if the Millennium target was low and somehow
poorly defined, as it failed to specify what a “significant
improvement” in the lives of slum dwellers would entail, it
was welcome at the time insofar as it provided the set figure
and deadline that had been missing in the Habitat Agenda
(1996). The Millennium Declaration also came as the first
clear commitment by the international community to address
an explicitly urban issue, in the process raising the profile of
cities and slums on the global agenda.
In 2003, UN-HABITAT, together with expert groups,
developed a set of five indicators of deprivation (see Box
p.33) in order to monitor and measure improvement in
slum conditions. Unfortunately, unlike other Millennium
Development Goals, the slum target was not set as a
proportion, such as halving the proportion of people living on
less than one US dollar a day, or reducing by two-thirds the
under-5 mortality rates18 with reference to a specific baseline
(in this case, the year 1990). Instead, the slum target was set
as an absolute number, and for the world as a whole. This
makes it difficult, if not outright impossible, to set countryspecific targets. A more effective alternative could have been,
for instance, for every country to halve the proportion of slum
dwellers in the urban population between the year 2000 and
2020. As the target stands, instead, governments do not know
the numbers of slum dwellers whose conditions they must
improve as part of the global target of 100 million. Clearly,
this target has diluted responsibilities and hindered a number
of governments from making serious commitments. Further
adding to the unambitious nature of the target is its extended
2020 deadline, instead of 2015 for all other Millennium
Development Goals.
Looking ahead to 2020, there is no question that the
world has proved that it can collectively achieve a slum
target that will narrow the urban divide by making a real
difference to urban populations. Without any doubt, urban
poverty and slums can be reduced, and the urban divide with
them. Governments and local authorities know what to do.
However, success requires a collective, medium-term effort
on the part of all member States. Even though the target was
low and easily achievable, progress has been made in various
countries. From a practical as well as a symbolic point of view,
this first achievement is eminently meaningful for all those

Countries that have been performing well so far must
maintain or increase efforts to improve the living conditions
of slum dwellers, while providing adequate alternatives to
prevent new slum formation. Those governments that are
falling behind in slum reduction must bring radical changes
to their attitudes and policies vis-à-vis slums and urban
poverty at large.19
In this respect, a multi-pronged policy response to the
persistent challenge of slums is a key target in its own right,
and one that has the potential to influence the achievement
of other Millennium Development Goals. Improving housing
conditions and providing for water and sanitation will not
only save lives among the very poor, but it will also support
progress in education and health. This first step out of poverty
will be another, major one across the urban divide.
Policymakers around the world must bridge the urban
divide at the regional, national, local and city levels, Policies
must focus on those countries and regions facing the greatest
development challenges in slum reduction: sub-Saharan
Africa and Western Asia. Other areas and countries in need of
special attention are those which, for all their overall progress
toward the slum target at the national level, are still faced with
huge spatial inequalities in some regions and cities. Finally,
policies must also focus on those cities which, although they
are doing relatively well, still feature large pockets of poverty
where people remain marginalized. It is increasingly apparent
that failure to set and meet a more ambitious slum target will
jeopardize the achievement of other MDGs.20 Only political
will, adequate policies and the right technical choices can
effectively tackle slums, which represent the most unacceptable
face of the urban divide.

Slum Dwellers: Proportions are Declining, but Numbers are Growing

involved. From a practical perspective, the success of the
better-performing countries gives hope for others; it conveys
a clear message that positive results are within reach. It shows
that for those countries lagging far behind, this is the time
for action. It is time to define a reasonable target, formulate
appropriate policies, set up strategies and procedures that are
clear, concise and easy to follow, and to dedicate significant
financial and human resources to effective results.
From a symbolic point of view, the success of some countries
is showing the world that it is possible to reduce urban poverty.
It is also showing which countries are honouring their pledge
to meet the slum target and which are failing to “keep the
promise” - a promise that is not only about numbers, but,
more importantly, about people: the 828 million people living
in deprived housing conditions, without improved water or
adequate sanitation, often in dilapidated dwellings without
sufficient living space or secure tenure.
The current global financial climate poses a risk that
some advances in slum upgrading and prevention may be
reversed. Another risk is that some gains can be undone by
government inaction or poor responses that do not take
population growth into account. Progress in improving
the lives of slum dwellers will depend largely on the way
governments address slums as part of the broader agenda of
reducing urban poverty and inequality.
The world has another 10 years to make further progress on
the slum reduction target by the 2020 deadline. Governments
must recognize that 100 million slum dwellers was a minimum
threshold, not a ceiling. Together they must revise and raise
the target to a number that takes into account both existing
and potential new slums. This is an essential building block if
the urban divide is to be bridged, if only over time.

The Urban Divide

Overview and Perspectives

Quick Facts	
1.	 Fragmentation of society is reflected in clear
differences in the way space and opportunities
are produced, appropriated, transformed and
used.
2.	 Economic and social exclusion typically results
in cultural and political exclusion.
3.	 A divided city exacerbates inequalities
and contributes to the stratification of the
population into a social hierarchy marked by
exclusion; ethnic minorities are often finding
themselves in the same category as the poor
and unempowered.
4.	 Further partitioning the city are divisive factors
like fear, anxiety and insecurity that contribute
to partitioning further the city.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Policy Points	
1.	 Inclusive policies for cities should
acknowledge the dynamics of the urban divide
and support informal business institutional
arrangements as well as affordable delivery of
land and housing.
2.	 Residents can gradually realize their individual
city rights through access to better services,
including health and education, jobs and
opportunities. Freedom of expression, equal
opportunities for business development,
recognition of cultural rights and adequate
housing are all equally important.
3.	 Strategies for inclusiveness must be based on
a clear and cogent representation of the way
the four dimensions of equality – economic,
social, political and cultural – can be integrated
concurrently into the day-to-day lives of the
population.
4.	 The “right to the city” encapsulates the four
dimensions of equality, which, combined, will
guarantee inclusiveness.

Divided spaces and opportunities

C

ities are more often than not divided by invisible
borders. These split the “back” from the “front”;
or the “higher” and “lower” areas, as the urban
divide is known colloquially in many parts of
the South. These man-made fractions often run along a spatial
and social continuum, reflecting the only difference between
their respective populations – socio-economic status.1 Closer
assessment of the urban space in many cities of the developing
world unambiguously exposes the fragmentation of society,
with clear differences in the way space and opportunities are
produced, appropriated, transformed and used. Some areas
feature significant infrastructure, well-kept parks, gardens
and up-market residential areas. In contrast, other areas are
characterized by severe deprivation, inadequate housing,
deficient services, poor recreation and cultural facilities,
urban decay and scarce capital expenditures. These tangible
differences in access come as symptoms of the intangible,
yet enduring divisions in society that apportion unequal
opportunities and liberties across all urban residents.
In diverse urban landscapes, sharp contrasts abound across
neighbouring streets, buildings, public spaces, gardens,
markets or offices. In places, these urban components merge
and blend into one another; in others, they are separated by
walls, doors, symbolic features or geographic factors such as
topography, rivers or lakes. Whether differentiated spaces
are contiguous or separated, they add to any social gaps and
deepen divisions across the city.
Cities as diverse as Nairobi, Buenos Aires, Johannesburg,
Mexico and Rio de Janeiro are similar in that pockets of wealth
and poverty co-exist in close proximity, sometimes just one
or two blocks from one another. In Mumbai, a city of stark
contrasts, skyscrapers face makeshift roadside settlements and
the largest slums in Asia. In other cities, wealth and poverty
are more clearly demarcated. For instance, in the northern
neighbourhoods of Quito, poverty affects fewer than 2 per
cent of the population, while in the barrios to the south, the
proportion is close to 95 per cent.2 Examples such as these
highlight the large disparities between better-off minorities
and the many poor, which are also reflected in different degrees

only 18 per cent female.5 In many cities of the developing
world, women are less educated than men; but even where
women have achieved higher education levels, their incomegenerating capabilities remain the same as, or even inferior to,
those of men. For instance, in the metropolitan area of San
José, Costa Rica, women earn, on average, 20 per cent less
than men, despite the fact that they have a higher proportion
of college degrees.6
These divisions are reinforced by spatial and socio-economic
differences within a city, illustrating the various degrees of
access made available by private-sector suppliers of goods and
services. From Port-au-Prince to Ibadan to Nairobi to Dhaka,
erratic power supply affects poor neighbourhoods more than
affluent areas. Blackouts, lack of adequate transportation and
inferior educational and health facilities for the urban poor are
all clear symptoms of a divided city, where middle-class and
rich households are better served simply because they can pay
or they have the capacity to negotiate the provision of services
and facilities for their specific neighbourhoods. In many cities,
public facilities predominantly used by the poor are described
as overcrowded and badly managed by poorly paid and
unmotivated staff, combining waste of resources with little
focus on results. In contrast, privately owned and managed
schools, universities and health centres generally feature better
equipment, more qualified staff and more advanced facilities
that can only be afforded by the middle and upper classes.
In Mumbai, for instance, half of slum neighbourhoods have
no primary schools.7 In Port-au-Prince, the disparity in
enrollment rates at primary level is significant: 59 per cent of
children from poor households are enrolled, as opposed to 79
per cent of those from better-off households.8 Such tangible
divisions in one and the same city create new social lines of
divide and reinforce those already separating the privileged
from the disadvantaged; this is the case in Port-au-Prince,
with its separate schools for the gran nèg, or the rich, and for
the malheureux, or the underprivileged.

The Urban Divide – Overview and Perspectives

of access to cultural facilities, public goods, transportation and
open spaces in most cities in the developing world.
Social segregation also transpires in economic statistics,
with sharp differences in incomes across neighbourhoods and
districts within one and the same city. For instance, in one of
the wealthiest neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires, average per
capita income is 1,400 pesos (or US $370), or three times
the average 371 pesos earned by the poorer residents. Such
disparities are also reflected in land values in the Argentinean
capital: the cost of one square metre in the rich neighbourhood
is 116 per cent higher than in the poorer one.3
Amartya Sen has amply demonstrated that it is incumbent on
development strategies to pool and mobilize skills and abilities
across the whole spectrum of society. This is the reason that
the urban divide as a concept cannot be defined exclusively
in terms of fragmented space and socio-economic disparities.
Since a sustainable city requires engagement with all segments
of the resident population, the social divide must also be taken
to involve the unequal opportunities across social categories,
age groups and gender regarding such resources as access to
knowledge, technology and gainful employment that may
hinder such effective engagement. Large sections of society are
frequently excluded on grounds of predetermined attributes
over which they have no control at all (such as gender, race,
ethnicity, age) or little control such as where they live (slums
vs. rich neighbourhoods) or what they own (income and
social status); however, this narrow perspective overlooks the
actual and potential contributions of marginalized groups
to building cities and nations, and therefore can only delay
progress toward sustainable and inclusive development.
Various forms of exclusion continue to marginalize vast
amounts of human capital that is only waiting to be mobilized
for the sake of sustainable cities. In New Delhi, for example,
52 per cent of men were employed in 2006, as opposed to
only 9.4 per cent of women.4 Likewise in the same year, 82
per cent of the total labour force in Chittagong was male and

Social and cultural divides

The divide has inter-generational consequences for society

Social divisions can permeate interactions amongst
individuals even in the absence of significant ethnic, racial or
other factors of segregation. Fresh divisions constantly emerge
and become entrenched; patterns of social inclusion or
exclusion preserve benefits for specific social segments based
on their physical location, shared interests or other criteria.
More often than not, economic and social exclusion result
in cultural and political exclusion as well. On top of the
features mentioned above, a divided city is also one that fails
to accommodate poorer residents, regardless of the cultural
richness they might lend to the city as a whole. Hip-hop
groups in cities throughout Africa and the Americas, samba
schools in São Paulo and tribus urbanas in Quito, for example,
represent vital aspects of youth culture, but they remain on
the margins of society, typically creating messages about, and
communicating only with, members of their own self-selected
groups. Though their voices may communicate important
truths about the cultural realities of large populations in cities,
such groups often remain excluded from, and marginalized
by, the urban mainstream.
Urban segmentation can also result from institutionalized
divisions of space and social belonging, such as the specific
form of citizenship formalized in China’s “Houku”, or
certificate of urban residence. At the other end of the range
of divisive factors are the intangible feelings of fear, anxiety
and insecurity that contribute to partitioning Rio de Janeiro
into safe and “no-go areas”, or that designate zones de droit
and non-droit in Port-au-Prince, or those that signal “nolaw neighbourhoods” in Mexico City. The urban divide not
only generates stigma, but to some extent also feeds on it.
In cities in Asia, Africa or Latin America, some spaces are
known for what they lack, as in the “barrios sin domicilios”, or
neighbourhoods without addresses. Symbolic dividing lines
can also refer to the history of a city: the “flooded district”, or
the “burnt area”, often conspicuously devoid of the amenities
and resources common to less damaged areas.

Slums are the face of a divided city. The divisive nature of
any city finds its graphical reflection in numbers such as the
proportion of slum dwellers to the overall population, or the
degrees of deprivation in slums. In some places (“cities with
slums”), informal settlements are located in one part of the
city, with the better-off neighbourhoods in another. In that
sense, a certain degree of homogeneity can be found in the
residential areas of an otherwise heterogeneous city. A good
example of this is Greater Mumbai, where the slum population
in the western suburbs is as high as 43 per cent, whereas in the
city proper it is only 17 per cent. A similar pattern features
in New Delhi District, where 3.4 per cent of the population
lives below the poverty line, whereas in the North West
District, this proportion is more than 30 per cent.9 A slum
area is typically associated with reduced numbers of schools,
clinics and other public and private amenities. In La Paz for
instance, mothers from slum areas are three times more likely
not to receive prenatal professional care than those from nonslum areas. This shows quite clearly that in a vital area like
reproductive health, unequal access to services can have fatal
consequences for mothers and children in a divided city: in
Bolivia’s capital in 2005, the probability of dying before the
age of 5 for slum-born children was 1.38 times higher than
for those born in non-slum areas.10
It is apparent, therefore, that low incomes and
multidimensional deprivations increase risks and exacerbate
the overall vulnerability of the poor. The partitioning of urban
and social space not only derives from the historical partition
of wealth and poverty, but is also a result of pronounced,
enduring intergenerational inequities. Indeed, children of
impoverished parents face a broad range of risks: malnutrition,
lack of educational opportunities and resources, and greater
incidence of diseases than their better-off counterparts,
coupled with lower access to proper health care and lower
life expectancy. Underprivileged children are also faced with
unequal opportunities when it comes to the social and cultural
expression of their specific identities, aspirations and feelings
within society. They are frequently relegated to the second or
third ranks in the urban hierarchy of tangible and intangible
amenities or benefits. For instance in Bogotá, up to one-third
of the housing stock in the underprivileged municipality of
Usme is located in environmentally hazardous areas.11 In
Nairobi, more than 200 informal settlements housing more
than half the population are crammed into a tight space
that represents only 5 per cent of the city’s residential land.
Similarly in Dhaka, 34 per cent of available space is planned
for allocation to 4.4 million upper- and middle-income people
outside the city centre, compared with only 4 per cent for
4.5 million low-income residents. This uneven distribution of
space, and the associated poverty, interfere with the exercise
of equal rights within the city – the primary reason being that
a substantial portion of the population is faced with restricted
access to employment and income, on top of other obstacles
to the development of their abilities and their opportunities
to live a better life.

A divided city not only exacerbates inequalities, it also
contributes to the stratification of the population into a social
hierarchy marked by exclusion. In the Peruvian city of Oruro,
the Andean population – Quechua-speaking, predominantly
female and illiterate, and with a high probability of becoming
parents in adolescence – is systematically excluded and
marginalized. In Jaipur, India, the “Schedule Casts” and
“Schedule Tribes” that represented only 12.5 and 3.4 per
cent, respectively, of the city’s residents in 2008, accounted
for as much as 53 per cent of the overall slum population.12
Undoubtedly, the high concentration of socially marginalized
groups among slum residents is an indicator of the urban
divide in any city. Ethnic minorities are finding themselves,
more often than not, in the same category as the poor and
unempowered. In the metropolitan region of São Paulo, 4.4
per cent of the population over 15 years was illiterate in 2004.
From this universe, illiteracy among the white population was
only 3.4 per cent, compared with 6.6 per cent among the black
or brown population. In a gender perspective, male illiteracy
among the white population was 2.5 per cent, compared
with 4.1 per cent for females; in contrast, among the black or
brown, 5.7 per cent of males were illiterate compared with 7.4
percent for females. It is worth noting that because of unequal
access to higher education, in the same year 20 per cent of
whites had college degrees, as opposed to only 5.9 per cent of
blacks or browns.13

Inclusive cities: A positive approach to the urban divide
The urban divide involves a range of negative factors that
are an integral part of the transformative process cities are
undergoing, especially in the developing world. Still, divided
cities should not necessarily be thought of as a negative
phenomenon. This evolving, multi-dimensional process calls
for a more nuanced understanding of city development. For
example, slums play a fundamental role in capital formation
in cities in the developing world, and also demonstrate
substantial economic potential. In New Delhi, up to one-third
of investment in housing is accounted for by slum dwellers.14
Similarly, informal sector activities today contribute as much
as 80 to 90 per cent of all new job opportunities in Latin
America.15 A positive development strategy calls for the
transformation of informal activities in order to create more
productive enterprise clusters.
The urban divide also incidentally creates human capital in
the form of social and cultural practices and arrangements that
allow people to save money, share resources, build businesses
and create opportunities in mutually beneficial ways. These
include initiatives such as community social funds, music and
art groups that provide education and cultural expression, as
well as informal institutional mechanisms that promote service
delivery to the marginalized. Recognition and promotion of
the economic potential of slums, or of social and cultural

initiatives that reflect the creativity of society, require a holistic
approach – one that enables all segments of the population to
participate in the economic growth and prosperity of cities
in a collective effort to promote long-term, sustainable urban
development.
An inclusive city, as defined for the purposes of this report,
is one that provides all residents – regardless of race, ethnicity,
gender or socio-economic status – with adequate housing
and decent basic services, and facilitates equal access to
social amenities, opportunities and other public goods that
are essential to the general and environmental well-being of
everyone (social inclusion).
An inclusive city upholds citizens’ rights and liberties,
and promotes social and political participation for the sake
of better-informed and more democratic decision-making
(political inclusion).
An inclusive city is one that fosters economic development
by way of equal opportunities for business and access to
employment, and promotes pro-poor economic policies
(economic inclusion).
An inclusive city promotes social integration and celebrates
diversity. It values people’s cultural rights, recognizing the
human capital of all segments of society, which it strives to
enhance through promotion of creative artistic expression
and heritage activities (cultural inclusion).

In this definition, residents’ environmental rights come
under the dimensions of social and cultural equality, since
they address the intergenerational aspects of individuals’
rights to live in safe and sound environments.
Against this background, municipal efforts to design and
implement strategies for inclusiveness must be based on a clear
and cogent representation of the way the four dimensions
of equality – economic, social, political and cultural – can
be integrated concurrently into the day-to-day lives of the
population. Residents can gradually realize their individual
city rights through access to better services, including
health and education, jobs and opportunities. Freedom of
expression, equal opportunities for business development,
recognition of cultural rights and adequate housing are all
equally important. Cities are the places where partnerships can
be forged, constructive debates can be held, and negotiation
and consensus can take place in a collective effort to promote
development.16
Therefore, it is for committed and proactive local
governments to build new relationships and alliances with
central and state/provincial authorities. Inclusive policies for
cities should acknowledge the dynamics of the urban divide;
in this respect, they should focus more particularly on any
positive components that could be integrated to formal
municipal norms and practices, such as the informal economy,
social capital and informal institutional arrangements,
including affordable land delivery and housing systems, etc.
Only through explicit and deliberately inclusive schemes
and procedures will it be possible to identify the locally
appropriate, innovative and high-leverage actions and policies
which government, civil service and major institutions can
deploy to set in motion self-reinforcing processes that will
overcome the urban divide.17

If the four dimensions of equality – social, political,
economic and cultural – are to be turned from a mere
conceptual paradigm into reality, they must be implemented
within a rights-based framework, and one that is easy to
enforce. Short of this, the prevailing patterns of exclusionary
development, selected benefit-sharing, marginalization and
discrimination will continue unabated in cities. Moreover,
entrenched types of socio-economic behaviour such as rentseeking and patronage will also persist unchecked (as would,
more generally, any challenge to what is known to economists
as “Pareto optimality”, through promotion of opportunities
for a few at the expense of others).
Such a rights-based framework is predicated upon three
requirements, though:
•	 Cities must develop a vision that integrates everyone.
•	 Cities must put forward plans and implementation
mechanisms that are adequately monitored and can be
revised depending on outcomes.
•	 Cities must set up new institutions, or improve and
strengthen existing ones, in order to ensure that they are
inclusive, accountable and efficient.

If met, these three requirements would, along with others,
guarantee that a city provides the framework that integrates
the dreams, aspirations, freedoms and rights of its entire
population.
The “right to the city” encapsulates the four dimensions of
equality, which, combined, will guarantee inclusiveness. The
fundamental principle of the right to the city is that human
rights are interdependent and indivisible. This calls for the
simultaneous achievement of all human rights for all residents
in any city. This, in turn, means that all human rights – political,
economic, social, and cultural – must receive equal priority in
city governance, planning, management and implementation.
The right to the city should also encompass the rights to selfdetermination and freedom of assembly and organization, and
the right to development (social, political, cultural, spiritual
and economic), both individual and collective. Endorsement
and implementation of a strong human rights-based approach,
therefore, is the only way to preserve and uphold the dignity
of all urban dwellers while addressing the multiple violations
and problems which millions in cities around the world are
facing today.
The right to the city is not to be viewed as yet another
legal concept; rather, it represents a dynamic and pragmatic
combination of the multiple human rights to which urban
dwellers are entitled, and that they want fulfilled. The concept
FIGURE 2.1.1: the right to the city

and implementation of the right to the city must be grounded
in the basic, universally recognized human rights principles
of non-discrimination, indivisibility, gender equality, gradual
realization, non-retrogression, subsidiarity, solidarity and
cooperation (see Chapter 3.1). With its implicit universal
ambit and egalitarian underpinning, the right to the city
suggests that special attention must be given to any individuals
or groups – including gender – in a situation of vulnerability;
the notion also strongly if tacitly subsumes responsibility and
sustainability as core principles.
Cities for all in the developing world
An inclusive city, as defined in this report, addresses
economic as well as social, political and cultural equality
across all segments of society. The notion of inclusiveness
as comprising these four dimensions derives from Sen’s
“capabilities” perspective.18 This perspective stresses how
important it is to view economic opportunities in conjunction
with all other forms of political, social and cultural rights
in societies that work together to build up “capable” social
capital in developing countries. Only when the four forms of
opportunities converge can they usher in optimal conditions
for production of the human capital required to enable
sustainable development.

Box 2.1.1: Policy Analysis on the Inclusive City: Survey methodology
To a significant extent, cities were selected
based on availability of “hard” indicators (such
as Gini coefficients, gross domestic product per
capita, labour structure, etc.); in a next step,
this quantitative data was combined with qualitative information provided by individual expert
groups (for their perceptions on the various
variables). Prior to the focus group meeting,
every group prepared a background document
for their respective city. These reports analyzed
the laws, regulations, policies and actions that
have contributed to make cities more inclusive,
specifying which stakeholders had brought
about the positive changes. This Report quotes
from a number of these expert background
papers in order better to reflect both perceptions of local realities, and understanding of the
“inclusive city” concept.

In 2009 UN-HABITAT conducted a policy assessment on inclusive urban policies in 27 cities in the
developing world: Africa (7 cities), Asia and Latin
America and the Caribbean (10 cities each). The
analysis was carried out by expert focus groups
in every city. Each group was comprised of some
15 experts from community associations, nongovernmental and other civil society groups, the
media, lawyers, urban planners, municipal officials and the business sector.
The questionnaire sent out to the 27 city-specific
focus groups took in the four dimensions of the
“inclusive city”, including the local institutional
and organizational capacities associated with
them. The assumption behind the survey was
that the “right to the city” encapsulates the four
dimensions of equality which, combined, bring
about inclusiveness.

UN-HABITAT tested the basic assumption behind
the survey against the expert group answers to the
questionnaire. Descriptive statistical analysis was
combined with econometric techniques in order
to understand the correlations and associations
between various aspects of inclusion/exclusion
and policy interventions. The econometric models
informed the substantive sections of Part 3
(“Bridging the Urban Divide”) of this Report and
guided policy analysis. The results of the survey
questionnaire were analyzed against UN-HABITAT
quantitative data, the background reports from
every city and other relevant information, in order
to make sure that progress towards inclusive
cities could be attributed to policy decisions and
related actions. Additional policy research was
conducted through literature and Web searches,
in order to shed more light on the causality of
policy changes.

The Economic Divide
Urban Income Inequalities

Quick Facts	
1.	 Economic development tends to go hand in
hand with more equitable income distribution,
except in Latin America (where income
inequality is stark), Eastern Europe and CIS
(where income inequality is low).
2.	 In the developing world, the concentration
of inequalities is higher in urban than in rural
areas, except in Latin America.
3.	 The magnitude of urban economic inequality,
or the severity of the economic divide, is not a
function of city size.
4.	 Overall the economic urban divide remains
sharp; it is slightly decreasing in Latin America
and is increasing moderately in Asia. Trends
are mixed in Africa, and transition countries are
becoming less egalitarian.
5.	 The stark rich-poor divide is most noticeable
in African and Latin American cities. In both
regions, the gap is often extreme compared
with cities in Asia, Eastern Europe and the CIS.

urban areas is a matter for socioeconomic
policy and structural reforms.
2.	 In developing countries, the more unequal
the distribution of income or consumption in
urban areas, the higher the risk that economic
disparities will result in social and political
tension.
3.	 Highly unequal income or consumption
patterns in cities in the developing world point
to institutional and structural failures, as well
as to broader economic problems such as
imbalanced labour markets or a lack of propoor policies.
4.	 Even when measured in strictly economic
terms, inequality can point to several types of
urban deprivation, such as lack of basic public
services like water and sanitation, some of
which are directly linked to the Millennium
Development Goals.

Global and city trends in
income inequality

A

ny full understanding of an inclusive city requires
a multidimensional assessment framework.
Such a framework must, indeed, account for
practical social, economic, political and cultural
opportunities, as well as the interdependencies among them.
A wide variety of measures is used to gauge the economic and
social condition of the world’s cities, and the most frequently
used measurements of the economic dimension of the urban
divide are income and consumption inequalities.
Inequality is usually measured on a national scale, but
attention is increasingly paid to general urban and cityspecific inequalities. As a further step in the research into
urban inequalities presented by UN-HABITAT in the
previous (2008/9) edition of the State of the World’s Cities
report, this chapter identifies and measures income and
consumption inequalities in a larger sample of cities from
both developed and developing countries, based on updated
data. It reviews ongoing trends and recent changes in the
urban divide as measured by economic inequality, including
some of the causal factors. For the purposes of this report,
UN-HABITAT has analyzed Gini coefficients for both
income and consumption at the general urban level, and,
where possible, for specific cities.
Two related cautionary points about UN-HABITAT data
must be stressed here. First, income inequality cannot be
mistaken with poverty: notionally at least, countries can be
so broadly well-off, or poor, as to feature minimal inequality
(see below under “The more equal cities”). Second, Table 1
presents groupings of countries that correspond to specific
Gini coefficient brackets and that in no way whatsoever can
be understood as rankings. The import of these groupings
is to suggest that the more income inequality, the higher
the potential for social and, ultimately, political tension.
This potential is mitigated by the institutional and other
arrangements that prevail in any particular location. Such
institutional arrangements (such as welfare) typically tend
to be stronger in developed than in developing countries.
Across all countries, though, a broader definition of these
arrangements also includes provision of services such as
health care, education, housing and basic facilities, etc.;

access to these can be unequal within individual cities, with
the potential of enhancing or mitigating equality as measured
in pure economic terms.
When measured in terms of consumption (household
expenditures) instead of income, high Gini coefficients also
denote unequal access to basic goods, which may act as a
hindrance to poverty reduction strategies and achievement
of Millennium Development Goals. Consumption-based
Gini coefficients are not immune from perverse effects and
can reflect some type of deprivation instead of “more equal”
access to urban services. For instance, poor households in
slum settlements typically spend relatively high proportions
of their low incomes on water when, for lack of alternatives,
they buy it from street vendors at a multiple of the prices
charged by water distribution utilities. More generally, both
income and consumption inequalities are linked to broader
economic factors like labour markets, capital investment in
public services, lack of pro-poor policies, etc. Further potential
distorting factors originate with economic and other patterns.
The services sector features a very wide range of income
levels, from the highest in any given city or economy to the
lowest available in the formal sector (cleaning, catering, waste
disposal). The informal economy similarly features a broad
range of incomes, which at the top of the range can both
be very substantial and go unreported for tax and statistical
purposes. Corruption and fraud are two further, unreported
distorting factors that are more likely to affect mid- to toprange incomes. Finally, urban dwellers in the middle to top
income brackets typically tend to consume more imported
products, including food, than those on low incomes.

The economic urban divide across the
world: An overview
Developed country cities: Inequality is relatively low
In general terms, income inequalities in developed countries
are low. Little is known, however, about inequalities at the
urban level, as available data is generally not disaggregated
to metropolitan areas or individual cities. The exceptions are
Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States of America.
Information on Gini coefficients in developed, highly
urbanized nations is generally provided on a nationwide scale.
Based on this data, national degrees of income inequality in
developed countries range from a low Gini coefficient of 0.23
in Denmark and Sweden to a high of 0.385 in Portugal.
Very low degrees of inequality are found in countries with
Gini values under 0.3, which is the average for 27 selected
developed nations that report nationwide Gini values. All
countries in this category are European and include (in order
of ascending Gini values): Denmark, Sweden, Luxemburg,
Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland, France, Belgium,
The Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and
Germany. The low degrees of inequality reflect the regulatory,
distributive and redistributive capacity of European welfare
states.1 Relatively low degrees of inequality that still exceed
the sample average for developed countries (between 0.301
and 0.385) are found in some other European countries such
as Spain, Greece, Ireland, United Kingdom, Italy, Poland and
Portugal (in ascending order), and also in Australia, Canada,
Japan, New Zealand and the United States of America.

Box 2.2.1: Measuring inequality: The Gini index
The term “inequality” has many different meanings. In this report, it is used primarily to describe how an indicator of economic well-being
is distributed over a particular population.
The Gini index is the most widely used summary measure of inequality. It measures the
distribution of either income or household
consumption expenditures as a ratio between
0 and 1, where 0 indicates perfect equality (a
proportional distribution of resources), and 1 indicates perfect inequality (where one individual
has all of the income or other resources and no
one else has any).
Since income is split between consumption and
savings, income-based are always higher than
consumption-based Gini coefficients, and savings accumulation, or lack thereof, is a major

determinant of wealth or poverty. For instance,
in 2003 the Gini coefficient in Addis Ababa was
0.560 for expenditure and, 0.612 for income.
The Gini coefficient can also be used to estimate other non-income inequalities, such as in
health, education, assets and access to infrastructure.
The meaning of the Gini index can be understood in terms of the “income gap” created
by unequal resource distribution. For example,
when the Gini coefficient is 0.47 – which is the
case in the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas in the United States
of America – it means roughly that the poorest
20 per cent of the population (the fifth quintile)
earns 3 per cent of the total income, whereas
the wealthiest 20 per cent (first quintile) earns
50 per cent of the total income.

The measurement of household income and
consumption inequalities is subject to different approaches in different countries. Some
countries – such as India, Mozambique and
Togo – base their inequality estimations on
household expenditure rather than income
because the statisticians responsible for
reporting inequality data presume that survey questions about consumption patterns
will produce more accurate results and less
suspicion than those about earnings. Other
countries – such as South Africa, China and
Brazil – base their inequality estimates on
income because they assume that household reluctance to disclose earnings will also
extend to expenditure. Still others, like Sri
Lanka, assess income inequality using both
income and expenditure.

Altogether, income inequalities at national level in developed countries increased between the mid-1980s and 2005.2
Growth in nationwide income inequality has been particularly stark in Poland and Germany, both of which experienced
increases of up to 17 and 10 per cent, respectively, between
the year 2000 and 2005 – the most significant rises in income
inequality of all of the developed countries under review.
Computations based on OECD data3 for 25 developed nations, however, show that the average Gini value changed by
less than 1 per cent between the year 2000 and 2005. Some
countries have even experienced a 4 to 7 per cent decline in
Gini values in recent years, particularly the United Kingdom,
Greece and Spain.
From a policy perspective, analyzing urban-level Gini
coefficients is fundamental to understanding and addressing
urban poverty. Yet, for all their wealth of information on
urban indicators and data, developed countries typically
do not report city-specific Gini coefficients, particularly in
Europe. Those that are available for specific metropolitan
areas or cities suggest that nationwide aggregates do not
always accurately reflect disparities in general urban or cityspecific incomes. For example, the national Gini coefficient
for Canada in the mid-1990s was 0.283, whereas the value for
the country’s urban areas was 0.36, indicating a higher degree
of inequality in cities than in rural areas. Likewise, Australia
reported a national Gini coefficient of 0.317 in the year
2000, but the value for the major cities was slightly higher,
at 0.332 in 2001. The most surprising variations between
national and city-specific Gini data are found in the United
States of America, where around 2005 the national coefficient
stood at 0.381, but exceeded 0.5 in many major metropolitan
areas including Washington, D.C., New York City, Miami

and others. These values are comparable to the average Gini
coefficients of cities in selected Latin American countries,
where income inequality is particularly steep (see Map 2.2.1).
When comparing national aggregates with city-specific
values, it is clear that huge variations can be found within
one and the same country. Even in highly urbanized societies,
national Gini coefficients conceal income inequalities at the
sub-national level.
Developing countries: Wide differences in income
inequality in urban areas across regions and countries
Income inequalities are generally greater in developing
than in developed countries. In the developing world,
disparities between urban and rural areas are often also quite
stark; consequently, national and local Gini values must be
disaggregated to provide an accurate picture of the disparities
in each environment. The following review of developing
countries delves into general urban as opposed to city-specific
inequalities. Whereas in developed nations, Gini coefficients
are based only on income, in developing countries the
calculations are based either on income or consumption
(see Box 2.2.1).
The overall pattern that emerges from a review of the
expanded UN-HABITAT database on urban income
inequalities in developing countries features values that differ
significantly across regions, countries and cities, as well as a
persistence of such differences over time. Table 2.2.1 illustrates
the breadth of urban Gini coefficients based on income across
selected developing countries. Five distinct groups emerge
from the analysis, ranging from “low” to “extremely high”
income inequality.

The developing world encompasses Africa, most of Asia, and
Latin America and the Caribbean; the review in this chapter
also includes those transition countries in Eastern Europe and
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for which
urban-level Gini coefficient data based on income is available.
Since most of the countries in Asia and Africa base their Gini
coefficient estimates on consumption instead of income, they
are not included here.
Low inequality: Countries in this bracket feature urban Gini
coefficients under 0.299. Their urban areas generally feature
broad provision of basic services and the social and redistributive policies that allow for an equitable income distribution.
Only Eastern European and CIS countries exhibit low degrees
of urban income inequality, likely owing in part to the influence of their former Socialist regimes with their strong social
institutions, safety nets and strict controls on wages. Belarus is
where urban income inequality is at its lowest, followed by Romania, Kyrgyz Republic, Bulgaria, Armenia, Hungary, Albania,
Kosovo and Serbia. In several countries in this “low inequality”
bracket, income inequality and poverty are increasing, though,
probably because of the post-Socialist erosion of public institutions, the abrupt opening-up of weak economies and declining
gross domestic product, among other factors.
Relatively low inequality: In this bracket, urban Gini coefficients range between 0.300 and 0.399, just below the international alert line of 0.4 above which inequalities may have
serious negative political, social and economic consequences for
societies if not properly addressed. These countries are divided
evenly between those with Gini coefficients under 0.34 (China,
Poland and Lithuania) and those with values higher than 0.34
(Algeria, Georgia and Tajikistan). Countries in this bracket typically feature healthy economic expansion, a degree of political
stability and relatively homogenous societies with only narrow
income and consumption disparities across social segments.
Relatively high inequality: This corresponds to Gini
coefficients between 0.400 and 0.449. This bracket comprises
a mix of countries from four regions: Africa, Asia, Eastern
Europe and the CIS. In Africa, the urban areas of Cameroon,
Uganda and Côte d’Ivoire feature the lowest income-based
Gini values, owing to recent policies that have strengthened
institutions and redistributive mechanisms against a
background of economic growth. In Asia, on the other hand,
cities in Viet Nam and Nepal, and to a lesser extent Malaysia,
exhibit relatively high income inequality with increasing
urban Gini coefficients. In Eastern Europe, the highest urban
Gini coefficient is to be found in Moldova (0.400). In the
CIS, cities in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Russia stand out
for their high degrees of income inequality compared with
the sub-region’s average (0.334). Some recent evidence points
to increasingly pronounced income inequalities in Russia
in the recent past, resulting from growing unemployment,
higher cost of living and an erosion of the redistributive
institutions.4
High inequality: In this bracket, urban Gini coefficients
range between 0.450 and 0.499 – above the threshold where
city and other public authorities should address inequality as

a matter of urgency. Most of the cities in this bracket are in
Latin America and the Caribbean.5 General urban Gini values
in El Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela, Panama, Peru, Costa Rica,
Paraguay, Mexico, Honduras and Bolivia are all high, although
just under the region’s average (0.505). In Asia, inequality is
high in the urban areas of the Philippines and Thailand. In
this bracket, inequalities are approaching dangerously high
levels; if the current trend continues, challenging conditions
in many cities could discourage capital expenditure and lead
to sporadic protests and riots. High income inequality is often
linked to weak labour markets, inadequate capital investment
in public services and lack of pro-poor social programmes.6
Very high inequality: This is the bracket where Gini
values ranging from 0.500 to 0.599 point to institutional
and structural failures in income distribution. Again, the
majority of countries in this bracket are in Latin America
and the Caribbean, a region where urban areas have been
characterized by high income inequality for many years. In
some African countries, urban income inequalities are also
becoming dangerously high, particularly in Nigeria, Kenya,
Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. In Asia, Sri Lanka is the only country
where urban areas feature very high income inequalities, with
a Gini coefficient of 0.55 – far higher than the region’s average
of 0.416.
Extremely high inequality: Whereas the urban areas in
several countries in this review have experienced very serious
income inequalities in recent years, only a few fall into the
“extremely high” bracket where Gini coefficients reach as
high as 0.600 or more. Such extreme values often result from
dysfunctional labour markets, sluggish economic growth,
structural problems of wealth distribution and institutional
failure that reflect long-standing patterns of inequality. All the
countries in this group are in Southern Africa, with urban
areas in the Republic of South Africa featuring the highest
degree of income inequality in the world (as measured by
Gini coefficients).
The magnitude of consumption inequalities in urban areas
Recent estimates show that in Africa’s urban areas (see
Map 2.2.2), Togo’s stand out as the least unequal, with a
consumption Gini coefficient of 0.31, or one-third below
the continent’s average urban Gini value for consumption
(0.45). If anything, though, this relatively equitable income
distribution reflects the almost uniform degree of poverty that
characterizes Togo’s urban areas. This stands in sharp contrast
with the low degree of inequality prevailing in Scandinavian
cities, which instead reflects strong distributional institutions.
Other countries where consumption-based Gini coefficients
for urban areas are below Africa’s average include Morocco,
Egypt, Mauritania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central
African Republic and Ethiopia, in ascending order (see Figure
2.2.1). Serious distributional problems are found further south
in Malawi and Namibia, with “very high” Gini values (0.52
and 0.58, respectively) denoting that consumption largely
remains concentrated in a small segment of the population.

When comparing income inequality in the urban areas of
countries in brackets 1 and 2 in Table 1 – those with “low”
and “relatively low” Gini values – with the extent of the
urban divide in countries appearing in brackets 3 to 6 – from
“relatively high” to “extremely high” urban income inequality
– it is clear that economic development somehow goes hand
in hand with broader income distribution. In general terms,
countries with low Gini coefficients belong to high-income
groups, except for some in Eastern Europe and the CIS
(bracket 2) that are classified as moderate-income countries.
On the other hand, high Gini coefficients are widespread in
countries ranging from medium- to low-income levels, and
particularly in poorer countries in Asia and Africa.
This relationship between higher development and broader
income distribution holds in all of the countries in the UNHABITAT sample; the only exception is Latin America and the
Caribbean, where GDP per capita is significantly higher than
in the other countries with very unequal incomes. As shown in

Figure 2.2.3: Urban Gini coefficient by Region and National

Income inequality and level of development

Figure 2.2.3, countries in Latin America are clustered high on the
Y axis, denoting high Gini coefficients, and around the middle of
the X axis, denoting moderate per capita GDP. This relationship
is even more obvious when compared with Eastern European
countries featuring relatively similar GDPs per capita to those in
Latin America, which is much more unequal.
Figure 2.2.3 also shows that most of the countries are
noticeably clustered according to the Gini-based bracket that
reflects their degree of inequality. For instance, countries in
brackets 1 and 2 (“low” and “relatively low” income inequality
in urban areas) are located at the lower right quadrant of the

The Economic Divide – Urban Income Inequalities

The consumption-based Gini values for the urban areas of all
these countries are above the region’s average as measured by
the sample, with Namibia’s coefficient exceeding that average
by as much as 30 per cent.
By comparison, household expenditure in Asia’s urban areas
is relatively less unequal. On this count, Indonesia features
the lowest Gini value in the whole region (0.328) and is
closely followed by Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, whose
urban areas all exhibit Gini values under the Asian average of
0.379. The distribution of household expenditures in urban
Sri Lanka and Cambodia is more unequal, with Gini values
of 0.43. This suggests unequal access to basic goods that may
hinder poverty reduction strategies, even against a background
of economic growth.

in brackets 5 and 6 (“very high” and “extremely high” income
inequality) appear in the top left quadrant (high Gini values
and low GDP). Malaysia, Botswana and South Africa are
interesting exceptions, with a GDP per capita significantly
higher than other Asian and African countries in bracket 5,
which are characterized by moderately unequal distributions
of income.

The concentration of inequalities is higher in urban than
in rural areas.
Nationwide averages of inequality conceal differences across
rural and urban Gini values, as well as among degrees of
inequality across cities. In most countries, the average income
gap between urban areas is greater than the average difference
between national income and rural income. Exceptions are
Morocco, Lesotho, Central African Republic, Cameroon and
Botswana, where the total national Gini coefficient is higher
than the Gini coefficient for the urban areas overall.

is substantially greater in urban than in rural areas in general.
Exceptions include Algeria, Sierra Leone, Central African
Republic, Botswana and China, where inequality is slightly
higher in rural areas. In Asia and Africa, inequalities are
growing faster in urban than in rural areas. Latin America
and the Caribbean is the only region in the developing world
where indices of income inequality in both urban and rural
areas are almost identical.7 In Latin America, the historically

unequal allocation of land in rural areas has combined with
ineffective redistributive policies in urban areas to reinforce
ingrained patterns of inequality. The land distribution patterns
established under Spanish colonial rule have institutionalized
latifundia and hacienda estates where indigenous people
were forced to work in indentured servitude; subsequent
agricultural modernization favoured large companies over
individual smallholder farmers, further marginalizing
indigenous agriculturalists. This historical, path-dependent
process was further consolidated under military dictatorships
and structural adjustment policies, and tackling this combined
legacy today is quite a challenge for land reform policies.
In urban areas, redistributive policies such as basic service
delivery and cash transfers have failed to make a deep and
lasting impact on either urban or rural poverty.8
Regional trends in the economic urban divide
In the previous edition of this report, UN-HABITAT
showed that inequality has increased since the 1980s,
particularly in transition and some emerging economies.
New information shows more mixed results on developing
countries: Latin America and the Caribbean has made
some progress in recent years; Africa shows no clear pattern
of increase or decrease of inequalities and Asia exhibits a
moderate overall increase. However, a closer examination of
changes in urban Gini coefficients per region shows specific
differences, which are reviewed in the next section.

Latin America and the Caribbean: A slight narrowing in
the divide

Africa: Mixed shifts in the economic urban divide
Trends in the economic divide in Africa’s urban areas are
mixed, or so suggests the sample in the UN-HABITAT
survey of Gini coefficients for various periods. Among the
13 countries under review, eight showed lower values (if only
marginally for some) and five featured moderate to significant
increases. The region’s urban areas, and in sub-Saharan
Africa in particular, retain the highest degrees of poverty
in the world, together with the highest prevalence of slum
populations in urban areas. In African urban areas, progress
in poverty reduction has been rather slow overall, and these
mixed results in the distribution of income and consumption
can only point to the hope of future improvements.
According to recent national surveys on income and
expenditures conducted in selected African countries, the
most significant reductions in Gini values in urban Africa
took place in Côte d’Ivoire between 2002 and 2008, and

Asia: The economic urban divide is widening
Asian countries are characterized by low to moderate degrees
of income and consumption inequality overall (see Map 2.2.3).
With the exception of the 1997/8 financial crisis, economic
growth in Asia has been robust over the past two decades, more
than doubling in real terms from 2.7 per cent to 5.8 per cent
between 1990 and 2007.9 As a result, average incomes have
increased in almost all Asian countries, and poverty has fallen
nearly everywhere in the region, with the exception of Bangladesh.
In the urban areas of seven Asian countries, Gini
coefficients have been rising, compared with decreases in
five other countries. Nepal, one of the few Asian countries
that has undergone an economic recession in recent years,
features the most significant increase, with its urban Gini
coefficient soaring from 0.26 in 1985 – at the time, one of
the lowest in the world – to 0.43 in 1996. In updated (2007)
data, the Gini coefficient at country level was still high as
economic conditions remained unfavourable.10 Mongolia
provides a variation on the same theme: the country’s urban
consumption-based Gini coefficient rose some 16 per cent
from 2003 to 2006 – an annual increment of about 5 per cent
– which was twice the rate of its economic growth during that
period, pointing to a need for more effective redistribution
policies. In the early years of the 21st century, China has also
experienced remarkable and sustained economic growth that
has contributed to lifting millions of people out of poverty;
yet at the same time, income inequalities have been increasing
in both urban and rural areas. According to UN-HABITAT

The Economic Divide – Urban Income Inequalities

In general, urban inequality in Latin America and the
Caribbean is declining, although it remains quite high. An
analysis of income distribution trends in 17 selected countries
in the region shows that in nine countries urban Gini
coefficients have fallen slightly from around 1999 to around
2006. Nicaragua recorded the most significant decrease in its
Gini coefficient, which dropped by approximately 10 per cent
as the country experienced a moderate economic recovery
between the year 2000 and 2005, with annual GDP growth
improving to about 4 per cent.
The next best performing countries in the region were
Brazil, Chile, Panama and Peru where income-based Gini
coefficients narrowed during this period by 7.4, 6.5, 5.6, and
5.4 per cent, respectively. In Honduras, Mexico and Paraguay,
Gini coefficients dropped by a range of 4.6 per cent to 3 per
cent. Argentina stands out as a basket case: from 0.54 in 1999,
its Gini coefficient had risen to 0.58 by 2002 in the aftermath
of a severe economic crisis; a robust recovery ensued with five
consecutive years (2003-2008) of over 8 per cent annual real
growth in GDP, which by 2006 had reduced the Gini value
to 0.52.
However, in the urban areas of five other Latin American
countries (Uruguay, Guatemala, Colombia, Costa Rica and
Dominican Republic), income inequalities have slightly risen
or remained stable, regardless of economic growth rates above
the region’s average.
The recent improvement in economic conditions in
various countries across the region has resulted in a narrower
income gap between rich and poor. However, the current
financial and food crises are likely to hamper the chances for
sustained economic growth in the coming years, and short
of appropriate pro-poor policies, inequalities may rise again,
instead of declining further.

in Uganda between 2003 and 2006, when the respective
coefficients decreasing from 0.51 to 0.44, and from 0.48 to
0.43, respectively. Côte d’Ivoire experienced this significant
narrowing in the economic urban divide even as annual GDP
growth rate was rather poor (under 1 per cent), reflecting
the civil strife in the country at the turn of the century. In
contrast, the significant decline in income inequalities in
Uganda coincided with annual growth rates of around 6 per
cent – which goes to show that economic growth does not
necessarily go hand in hand with increasing inequalities. This
is the case in a few other African countries: Benin, Rwanda
and Tanzania all managed to reduce urban consumption
inequalities in a dynamic economic environment where GDP
growth ranged between 4 and 6.5 per cent.
In the urban areas of several other African countries, the
economic divide as measured by Gini coefficients has increased,
signaling a widening gap between rich and poor in terms of
access to basic resources. Burkina Faso, Egypt and Ethiopia
have seen their urban consumption Gini coefficients increase
by 7.8, 13.2 and 11.8 per cent, respectively. In Zambia,
too, urban income inequality has increased by 8.2 per cent,
pushing the country into the “extremely high” inequality
bracket – even as Zambia’s GDP grew at an annual rate of
about 5.5 per cent between 2003 and 2006. In Mozambique,
consumption inequalities have widened only marginally.

data, income inequality in China’s urban areas (as measured
by Gini values) grew from 0.23 in 1988 to 0.32 in 2002, and
has continued to rise. Though still relatively low, these Gini
values represent a 39 per cent increase over the period.
In urban Viet Nam, income inequalities increased by 17 per
cent between 1993 and 2002 against a background of rapid
economic growth. In urban Bangladesh in the 1990s, inequalities in consumption increased by an even steeper 20 per cent,
compared with 9 per cent in India and 6.3 per cent in Pakistan
in the early 2000s. In India, the widening economic urban divide came in sharp contrast to annualized GDP growth of over
5 per cent in the early 2000s. India provides an apt demonstration of the practical implications of the difference between
income-based and consumption-based Gini coefficients. The
country compiles urban Gini coefficients based on consumption only (i.e., excluding savings, namely, assets), which in this
case minimizes the extent of urban economic inequalities.11

2,000

4,000 Kms

The increasing share of the top 1 per cent of income-earners in
India’s total national income points to an even steeper surge in
income inequality, especially since the early 1990s.12
In the urban areas of five other Asian countries, the economic
divide has narrowed in recent years, as reflected in income- or
consumption-based Gini coefficients. Sri Lanka recorded the
sharpest decline between 1990 and 2006: a drop of 11.3 per
cent, or an annualized decline of -0.7 per cent. In the meantime
in the country at large, Gini values also fell (from 0.62 in 1990
to 0.55 in 2006). These improvements in both general urban
and nationwide values coincided with a period of sustained (4.9
per cent) economic growth, but the degree of consumption
inequality remains high (at 0.43), suggesting that the benefits
of overall prosperity are not as broadly distributed in Sri Lanka
as they could be. Malaysia, Cambodia and the Philippines are
the three other Asian countries where the urban economic
divide narrowed in recent years.13

National averages tend to conceal any substantive
differences between inequalities in a country’s urban areas
overall and those in specific cities. The disparities between
the urban rich and the urban poor as measured in terms of
income and consumption distribution in specific cities vary
considerably across developing regions, with the stark richpoor divide most noticeable in African and Latin American
cities, as suggested earlier. In both regions, the gap is often
extreme compared with cities in Asia, Eastern Europe and the
CIS, where the degree of inequality remains relatively low.
Using an expanded dataset of city-specific Gini coefficients,
UN-HABITAT has calculated simple averages for regions
based on 109 cities selected for their noteworthy variations.
The 37 African cities in the sample display the highest average
Gini coefficient (based on income) of all regions, at 0.581.
Next come the 24 selected Latin American cities, with an
average Gini coefficient of 0.528. Taken together, the 30
selected Asian cities feature a comparatively low degree of
income inequality, as measured by a Gini coefficient of 0.384.
This average is just below the 0.40 threshold, above which
inequality is considered unacceptably high. Among the cities
in the sample, those in Eastern Europe (8) and the CIS (10)
feature the lowest average Gini values and, presumably, the
greatest degrees of equality, at 0.298 and 0.322, respectively.
(Figure 2.2.5).14
Indices of income inequality aggregated at the national
urban level differ from the averages of the selected cities.
Although a clear pattern fails to emerge, the averages of
city-specific Gini coefficients in Africa and Latin America
are higher than those for the two regions’ aggregated urban
Gini value, whereas in Asia, Eastern Europe and the CIS, the

As for measures of the economic divide based on
consumption rather than income, general urban or cityspecific data are available only for countries in two regions:
Africa and Asia. Urban Africa consistently shows much
higher degrees of inequality than Asia, based on both
consumption and income. Even though, as might have been
expected, values for consumption are lower than for income,
here again Africa remains characterized by high degrees of
inequality, with Gini coefficients of 0.394 for the average
of 49 selected cities and towns, and 0.45 for urban areas

in 15 countries. Asia similarly exhibits lower inequalities in
consumption, with an average Gini value of 0.326 for six
selected cities and 0.379 for urban areas in seven countries.
The most unequal cities
Of all the cities in the UN-HABITAT sample, Buffalo City
(East London), Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni (East Rand),
among other South African cities, are the most unequal in the
world, with extremely high Gini coefficients of 0.71 or more.
They are followed by the Brazilian cities of Goiana, Fortaleza,
Belo Horizonte and Brasilia: all of these feature income Gini
coefficients above 0.60, making them the most unequal cities
in Latin America and the most unequal in the world after
South Africa (Figure 2.2.7).
Colombian cities such as Bogotá, Barranquilla and Calí,
and Lagos in Nigeria, top the list of those where the urban
economic divide is at its sharpest, alongside Chiangmai and
Udonthani in Thailand,15 all of which feature income Gini
coefficients above 0.55 (which is considered “very high”
inequality). They are closely followed by some cities in
Argentina (Catamarca and Buenos Aires), Chile (Santiago and
Chillan) and Ecuador (Quito), all of which record income
Gini values between 0.55 and 0.51.

The Economic Divide – Urban Income Inequalities

converse is true. Variations between inequalities at the city
and urban levels are notable in Africa, Latin America and
Asia: while the average Gini coefficient for individual sampled
cities in Africa stands at 0.581, its collective equivalent for the
region’s urban areas overall is 0.539, a difference of 4 per cent
(see Figure 2.2.5 and 2.2.6). In Eastern Europe and the CIS,
variations between these two types of average are negligible: in
Eastern Europe, for instance, the city-specific income-based
Gini coefficient is 0.298, compared with 0.306 for its general
urban equivalent. These variations confirm the assumption
that national trends cannot account for what is happening
in every city or sub-region in the same country, because the
factors of inequality are determined by history and culture,
and are largely influenced by local policies and actions.

73

Box 2.2.2: Measuring inequality: Sources and types of data
In the 2008/9 edition of this report, UN-HABITAT drew from a relatively large dataset of Gini
coefficients for 94 cities in 47 countries, and an
additional 68 countries with data aggregated
at the national urban level. For the current report, UN-HABITAT has expanded its dataset to
city-level data for 119 cities in 61 countries;
national-level urban data for 72 countries; and
sub-regional data for 216 predominantly urban
states, provinces and districts in 15 countries.
In total, the enlarged UN-HABITAT database
includes data on income and consumption distribution in a total 90 countries. The database
has also been updated. Urban inequalities at
the national or city level are calculated in the
current report from data collected between
1988 and 2008. The previous report cited data
from 1983 to 2005.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Roughly 57 per cent of the Gini coefficients
presented in this report are based on income,

74

and the remaining 43 per cent on consumption.
For the purposes of analyzing inequalities, estimates for income and consumption have been
systematically separated. Data on Gini coefficients is derived from of a mix of sources. The
Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean has compiled Gini coefficients
for UN-HABITAT at the urban, rural and selected city levels, based on data from household
surveys and census information from 1989 to
2007, and calculating two or three points in
time, where possible. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific has produced Gini coefficients through a
similar arrangement, calculating the values at
the national, provincial or state, urban and city
levels based on various sources, including national surveys, census data and special surveys
that were conducted by the national statistical
offices in selected countries in different years.

Other highly unequal cities stand out as more isolated cases,
with values well above the national average. They include (in
decreasing order): Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Maseru, Mexico
City, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong and Port-au-Prince,
all featuring Gini coefficients above 0.52, which ranks as
“very high”.
For all these cities, the Gini coefficients are based on income.
When values are based on consumption expenditures, they
are invariably lower. Addis Ababa, with a Gini coefficient
of 0.56,16 and Maputo and Casablanca, both with Gini
coefficients of 0.52, feature the highest values in the world
for consumption-based inequality. There can be little doubt
that if data on income distribution in Maputo, Casablanca or
other similar cities were available, it would show even greater
degrees of inequality.
The most equal cities
The cities in the broader, updated UN-HABITAT sample
returning lower Gini coefficients than those reviewed above
are more likely to offer more equitable environments, with
adequate housing and affordable basic services. Still, this
does not mean that measuring economic equality in a city
will reveal whether it affords residents all of the opportunities
of an ideal equitable city. The Gini coefficient may be the
most widely used measure of how equitable a city is, but as
an indicator it suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) the
Gini coefficient fails to capture the proportion of a country’s
population that is poor, and (2) it does not measure the noneconomic dimensions of an equitable or egalitarian city, as
described above. The Gini method is a useful measure of a
fairly narrow kind of inequality, which is the difference in
income (or consumption) of a typical individual from the
incomes of those right above and below them; but clearly,

UN-HABITAT complemented the set of Gini coefficients for the region with information from
the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank
and the national statistical offices and planning
units of various governments, as necessary.
Gini coefficients for cities and urban areas in Africa have been collected from various sources,
as there is no central depository of such data
in the region. UN-HABITAT approached national
statistics offices, ministries of finance and planning and other government departments involved in poverty reduction and country strategy
papers, including the International Monetary
Fund and the South African Cities Network.
UN-HABITAT calculated Gini coefficients for the
small cities and towns in the Lake Victoria Region in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya based on
its own urban inequality surveys. Such surveys
were also conducted by UN-HABITAT in Addis
Ababa, Casablanca and Dakar.

income inequality tells only part of the story of inequality in
any given place.
Among UN-HABITAT’s sample of cities, Jakarta,
Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Lomé, Freetown, Dar es Salaam,
Phnom Penh, Bissau and Dakar stand out as the most egalitarian
in the developing world, as measured by consumption-based
Gini coefficients (with a range of 0.27 to 0.37).
The problem is that the “most equal” developing-world
cities in the UN-HABITAT sample are in fact “equally poor
cities”, as they feature similar distribution of consumption
expenditures across rich and poor. However, all these cities
fail to provide water, sanitation or housing to all residents, and
they feature some of the highest incidences of slums in their
respective regions. The “most equal cities” in the sample also
perform poorly on various social indicators. In Bangladesh,
for example, Chittagong and Dhaka – with consumptionbased Gini coefficients of 0.29 and 0.31, respectively – suffer
from high rates of under-5 mortality, reaching 97 deaths per
1,000 children at urban level nationwide and up to 130 in
the most deprived slum settlements. In Dakar, a city with
relatively low consumption inequality (0.37), the literacy rate
among women was 63 per cent in the year 2000, compared
with 90 per cent for men; this combined into a female-tomale literacy ratio of 0.7, reflecting a marked gender disparity
in the Senegalese capital. Likewise, in Jakarta and Dar-esSalaam, overall literacy rates for women stand around 94 per
cent, but in slums and the most deprived areas they drop to
63 and 50 per cent, respectively.
Another feature of the “equally poor” cities in the UNHABITAT sample is that economic growth proceeds at
different paces. Some are dynamic and growing fast; others are
experiencing slower paces of development. As they continue
growing, though, cities must fulfil two related duties for
the sake of their populations: (1) they must ensure that any

progress toward more egalitarian distribution of consumption
is going to remain over time, and (2) they must enhance
economic and social opportunities for the poor, women and
other vulnerable groups, in the process reducing the systemic
social deprivations that prevent certain segments of society
from achieving the benefits of an egalitarian city.
A review of income-based coefficients in the UN-HABITAT
sample shows that Beijing is the “most equal” city in the
world, with a Gini value as low as 0.22 in 2003. It is followed
by Benxi, (0.29) and several other Chinese cities including
Shanghai, Baoji and Xian, which all boast Gini coefficients
below 0.37. Several cities in Jordan are also characterized by
very low income Gini coefficients (between 0.31 and 0.35),
including Amman, Jerash, Ajloun, Irbid, Zarqa, Mafrq,
Balga, and Madaba.17 Hanoi in Viet Nam and Caracas in
Venezuela also feature relatively low income inequality, with
Gini coefficients below 0.39.
Where and how is the economic urban divide decreasing?
A review of recent trends in inequality conducted by UNHABITAT bears only on a limited sample of 48 cities for
which data is available: 19 in Africa, 22 in Latin America and
only seven in Asia. It must be stressed here that the results
depict only general patterns, but can nevertheless point to
potential drivers of change.18
In 27 out of these 48 cities, Gini coefficients are seen to
decrease, though to a very small extent in some cases. In 11
of those cities – eight in Africa, two in Latin America and

one in Asia – the decrease in Gini coefficients is significant
(by more than 1 per cent per year), ultimately changing by
more than 10 per cent. Over the period recorded in the UNHABITAT sample, inequality actually increased in 21 cities.
Of these, significant increases of more than 1 percent per year
were notable in five cities in Africa, two in Latin America and
two in Asia.
In the Ethiopian cities of Awasa, Bahir Dar and Jimma, Gini
coefficients based on consumption declined substantially (by
21 per cent, 10 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively) between
1994 and the year 2000. Several factors may have been at
play behind these reductions in consumption inequality:
access to education, health services, nutrition, and water and
sanitation have improved throughout the country, on top of
significant development in infrastructure, roads, power lines
and telecommunications.19 A recovery in food production
in the mid-1990s, coupled with relatively strong economic
growth, may have significantly reduced poverty for many
households, especially in places most affected by recurrent
droughts.20 It also appears that expenditures on housing
have not significantly affected consumption distribution, as
rents paid to kebeles – the smallest administrative units or
associations of residents – in Awasa, Bahir Dar and Jimma
may have experienced a lower increase than the Ethiopian
capital of Addis Ababa in recent years (Figure 2.2.9).
Elsewhere in Africa, urban economic inequality has also
declined in Accra, Ghana, by a significant 16 per cent between
1987/8 and 1992, and in Dakar the household level Gini
coefficient declined by 9 per cent (0.458 to 0.419) between

share of social spending on the country’s white population
decreased from 55 per cent in 1975 to 33 per cent in 1990,
17 per cent in 1993, and 9 per cent in 1997. By 1997, racebased spending allocations were roughly proportionate to
each group’s share of South Africa’s population.23
In Latin America and the Caribbean, several Brazilian cities
have recently (between 2005 and 2007) experienced significant
declines in their income Gini coefficients, including São
Paulo (18 per cent), Rio de Janeiro (12 percent) and Brasilia
(6 per cent). Decreases in income inequality in these cities are
concomitant with those in overall urban Gini values in Brazil,
which fell from 0.63 in 1999 to 0.60 in 2004 and 0.58 in 2007.
The gradual drop in the Gini coefficient can be attributed in
part to three well-documented factors: demographic trends,
education policy and social protection. Declines in the size
of Brazilian families and improvements in family dependency
rates and access to education have helped reduce inequality.
In the early and mid-1990s, universal admission to primary
schooling and reductions in the rates of grade repetition led
to a drop in the Gini coefficient by about 0.2 points per year
from 1995 onward. Direct government cash transfers to
households through the Bolsa Familia programme have also
reduced income inequality, and increases in other forms of
social protection, such as an increased minimum wage, have
led to a further decrease of 0.2 Gini points per year.24 These
well-designed and targeted social policies have stimulated
aggregate demand and consumption, enlarging the domestic
market, which in turn spurred further increases in income
and purchasing power (see Figure 2.2.10).25

The Economic Divide – Urban Income Inequalities

1994/5 and 2001/2. In Dakar, the changes can be associated
with rapid economic growth and Senegal’s intensive emphasis
on infrastructure development, which generated jobs and
promoted self-employment. Remittances from abroad have
also been a significant source of income for Dakar’s poor
households. According to a 2008 study by Senegal’s Ministry
of Economy, remittances amounted to 500 billion CFA Francs
(about US $1.1 billion) in 2007, a figure that has remained
relatively stable in recent years. Cash transfers go primarily
into household expenditures and investment in property. It is
estimated that without these international transfers, poverty
in Senegal would affect 53 per cent of the population, or 16
per cent more than with remittances.21
In South Africa, the cities of Mangaug, Tshwane (Pretoria),
Johannesburg, and Cape Town experienced moderate (3 to 5
per cent) reductions in Gini coefficients between 2001 and
2005. This largely reflects significant economic and social
improvements, particularly the introduction of a social
(minimum) wage and subsidized rates in basic service delivery,
education and housing.22 Since 1994, the government of
South Africa has effectively been redistributing wealth and
welfare resources, spending public funds and deploying social
programmes to bring about a more equitable distribution
of public goods among the population. Back in 1975, the
government’s share of social spending on the country’s black
population was only 28 per cent, compared with 55 per cent
on the white population. The share of social spending on
the black population increased to 51 per cent in 1990, 67
per cent in 1993, and 80 per cent by 1997. In contrast, the

In which cities are income inequalities growing and why?
The most significant increases in Gini coefficients in the
UN-HABITAT sample cities have occurred in Colombia,
where measures of income inequality climbed by 24 per cent
in Bogotá between 1991 and 2005, 10 per cent in Calí and
4 per cent in Medellín between 1991 and 1998. Three welldocumented factors can account for the increases in income
distribution in Colombian cities. First, the informal sector
has led in new job creation, in the process demonstrating
that the formal economy is not in a position to accommodate
Colombia’s growing workforce. According to estimates by
the International Labour Organization, eight out of every
10 jobs created in the 1990s were low-quality jobs in the
informal economy.26 Second, wage discrepancies in Colombia
are becoming much more significant between skilled and
less-skilled workers, with better-skilled workers earning
increasingly more. Similarly, wages of college graduates
relative to high school graduates in Colombia increased by 21
per cent between 1991 and 1995, and similar gaps have been
recorded between workers who had graduated from secondary
school and those who had not.27 In Colombia’s manufacturing
sector, the wages of non-production or white-collar workers
increased in relation to production or blue-collar workers;
overall, differences in occupation accounted on average for
15 per cent of labour income inequality in the 1990s.28 Third,

increases in private investment, exports, capital inflows and
currency overvaluation have resulted in greater inequality in
Colombia. However, in recent years, the economy has grown
by more than 6 per cent annually, and increased government
social spending (in the form of subsidies to the poor) has
helped to offset increases in income inequalities that might
result from economic prosperity.
Income inequalities also increased in Mexico City by 7 per
cent (from 0.52 to 0.56) between 1992 and 2005. Among
other factors, the rise in the city’s Gini coefficient reflects
declining trade union affiliation and falling real minimum
wages coupled with a shift in trade that has resulted in higher
wages for more qualified workers. In Argentina, Buenos Aires
experienced rising inequality (around 5 per cent) from 1990
to 2005, a period marked by macro-economic stabilization
policies, more open international economic flows, deregulation
and structural reforms, including privatization. This 15-year
trend was characterized by the closure of manufacturing
firms, layoffs in privatized companies and widespread
unemployment, which culminated in the 2000/1 economic
crisis. Recovery materialized only around 2003, but had no
clear influence on overall socioeconomic conditions until
2005.29
In Africa, the most significant increases in inequality in
recent years have occurred in Addis Ababa, where the Gini
coefficient for consumption rose by 24 per cent between

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Box 2.2.3: Income inequality and city size
Economists have long supported the idea that
inequality is a natural consequence of urban
growth and development. As a country’s population becomes more and more urban and both
the labour force and the productive sector shift
from more equitable traditional and agricultural
activities to less equitable modern, industrial
activities, inequalities are expected to increase
until aggregate incomes rise to a point where
all members of society reach a common standard of living. Recently, economists have applied this concept to cities of various sizes, arguing that income inequality increases as city
size grows, or that large cities tend to feature
higher income disparities (as measured by Gini
coefficients) than smaller ones. However, what
may be evident in the developed world has not
been observed in the South.
Based on an expanded database of cityspecific Gini coefficients and a larger sample
that includes small and intermediate cities in
developing countries, UN-HABITAT has identified wide variations in Gini values across the
city size spectrum. For example in a large city
like Hong Kong, the Gini coefficient stands at

0.53, compared with only 0.22 in China’s capital Beijing. In Jordan, the small cities of Jerash
and Irbid feature low Gini coefficients (0.31),
or nearly half those of similar-sized Monoregala
and Rathnapura in Sri Lanka.
One of the most significant findings in this analysis is that average Gini coefficients for small,
intermediate and large cities in the sample
are quite similar, and no clear trend emerges
whereby large cities are “more unequal” than
smaller ones, or vice-versa. The poor relationship found between city-specific Gini values
and population size challenges the previously
accepted view that narrow wage distributions
(i.e., low Gini values) are a defining feature of
small and intermediate cities while larger ones,
as the typical hosts to both highly paid workers (with advanced technical and professional
training) and poor immigrants, naturally feature
much broader income disparities. On the contrary, UN-HABITAT surveys of urban inequalities
in 17 towns around Lake Victoria in East Africa
found Gini coefficients similar to, or higher than,
those in the capital cities of their respective
countries. For instance, the consumption-based

Gini coefficient for Bukoba, with a population of
about 100,000, stands at 0.34, the same as for
Dar es Salam. Likewise, the Kenyan towns of
Migori and Kisii feature income Gini coefficients
of 0.558 and 0.631, respectively, compared
with Nairobi’s 0.58. Clearly, city size is not necessarily – nor even evidently, according to UNHABITAT’s analysis of urban settlements in the
developing world – a determinant of inequality.
Cites and countries can feature such drastically
different cultural and political histories, policies
and paths to development that it is not possible
to establish a direct relationship between city
size and the distribution of income.
This is why city authorities and policymakers
must be well aware of the particular ways in
which their cities are growing and changing
over time. Improved living conditions for lowincome and middle-class residents, and bridging not just the economic but also social, racial
and cultural divides through redistributive policies, conscious urban planning and subsidies
for housing and other needed amenities, would
all go a long way toward building economically
integrated communities in cities of all sizes.

the year 2000 and 2003; and in Abidjan, where the Gini
coefficient increased by 21 per cent between 2002 and 2008.
Significant increases in consumption inequality were also
recorded in the Ethiopian cities of Dessie and Dire Dawa
(11 and 8 per cent, respectively), and in Maputo, capital of
Mozambique, where consumption-based Gini values rose by
18 per cent between 1996 and 2003. While the proportion
of people in Mozambique living below the poverty line fell by
15 per cent nationwide between 1996 and 2003, growth in
consumption has been much faster for better-off than poorer
residents, clearly suggesting that economic growth in Maputo
may not be as equitable as in other parts of the country.30
The high degree of consumption inequality in Addis Ababa
can be attributed to a combination of factors, particularly the
enduring effects of the policy choices made under the country’s
structural adjustment programme, with its lifting of subsidies
on basic services, public expenditure cuts, tax reform and
credit restrictions, all of which contributed to the persistence
of poverty and inequality, particularly in the capital city.31
The economic and political transition in the country has
brought increased capital expenditure that is more beneficial
for people with relatively better skills and high initial asset
accumulation, most of whom are located in the capital city.32
Gradual deregulation of social housing in the hands of kebeles
has resulted in a disproportionate increase in housing rents for
the urban poor in Addis Ababa.

All unequal cities are not so in the same way
UN-HABITAT data and analysis confirm that urban
income inequalities take different forms across different cities
and carry a variety of dimensions with them. It frequently
happens that the income-based Gini coefficient for a city does
not reflect the “bundle of commodities and services” available
to residents; this has led an increasing number of countries
to adopt consumption or household expenditure as a more
accurate benchmark of inequality. Cities, and countries such
as India, that make various subsidies available to low-income
groups tend to feature lower consumption inequality, as they
enable people to access basic goods for free or at reduced rates.
Similarly, Canadian cities tend to be less unequal than those
in the United States, as Canada maintains a range of social
policies that target the poor and the vulnerable.
At times, inequalities in urban incomes conceal other types
of divides, or fail to capture achievements in public service
delivery or literacy. UN-HABITAT data shows that while
Brazilian cities generally tend to experience extremely high
degrees of income inequality, they fare better than highly
unequal cities in poor African countries when it comes to
access to piped water and sanitation. For instance, in 2007,
even though Brazil’s capital city Brasilia featured a very high
(0.60) income Gini coefficient, 90 per cent of the population
had access to piped water and 85 per cent to sanitation.

For all its relevance as an indicator of wealth distribution, income
inequality is not sufficient to describe what is actually happening in a community, or how that community might change for
better or worse. Focusing on income inequality and overlooking
other social, cultural and political indicators of well-being is to
see only one side of the picture.
A consensus is emerging among academics and policymakers
that inequality is multidimensional and cannot be viewed solely
through the prism of income. It is now generally accepted that
human beings can have access to a variety of assets, freedoms
and opportunities, besides income, on which they can rely not
just to survive but also to express their social and other identities. More often than not, these forms of social capital are not
reflected in economic surveys, which are more concerned with
earned income figures for various groups. Surveys also fail to
capture “the hidden economy” of households, such as unpaid
labour or in-kind and cash assistance from relatives and friends.
The various dimensions of “wealth” are fundamental to Amartya
Sen’s concept of “entitlements” and the “capabilities” approach
to development, which holds that the quality of an individual’s
life should be measured not by their income, but by the rights
and freedoms s/he enjoys.

segregation. ©Andrew F. Kazmierski/Shutterstock

For many people in the United States, moving up from the lowest economic ranks to the
middle class, and from the middle class to the
top income echelons, is becoming increasingly
difficult. The richest 1 per cent of households
now earns more than 72 times the average
income of the poorest fifth of the population,
and 23 times that of the middle fifth. In just
one year, between 2005 and 2006, the richest 1 per cent of the U.S. population increased

The United States has more cities with a Gini
coefficient of 0.50, or higher than any other
wealthy country. Gini coefficients based on
2006 data for 247 American cities with populations over 100,000 range from 0.35 to 0.57.
Forty cities feature Gini coefficients above
0.50, indicating high income inequality due to
poverty and racial segregation, post-industrial
economic restructuring and combinations of
inner-city decline and suburban sprawl.
In “the other America”, poor black families and
the chronically unemployed are clustered in
ghettos, lacking access to quality education,
secure tenure, lucrative employment and political power. Higher inequality often corresponds
with greater segregation, especially for black
residents. The most unequal city, Atlanta,
Georgia, has the third-highest degree of black
segregation, followed by New York City, Wash-

ington, D.C, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami (all
with Gini coefficients above 0.52).
In Chicago, discriminatory mortgage lending and
public housing development from the 1960s
onward conspired to isolate many low-income
black families in the central city. Lack of affordable housing outside the city centre, coupled
with high unemployment and poor education,
has further undermined social mobility and economic advancement. In Washington, D.C., the
vast majority of black residents live on the eastern side of the metropolitan area, far from the
economic prosperity, wealth, job growth, and
quality schools now concentrated in the west.
Earning power and income prospects depend
on a geography of opportunity, i.e., access to
good-quality institutions, decent housing and
amenities that foster good health and prosperity. Even where standards of living are high,
the marginalization and spatial segregation of
specific groups creates cities within a city: distinctly deprived areas that further reinforce unequal opportunities and the distance between
abject poverty and affluence.

On the other hand, Ethiopia’s capital city Addis Ababa also
featured a very high Gini coefficient (0.612) in 2003, but only
two-thirds of the population had access to piped water and
only 44 per cent to adequate sanitation. While these numbers
show that near-universal access to services does not necessarily
result in lower income inequality, they also demonstrate that
measures of income inequality do not necessarily capture
those determinants of quality of life that are associated with
social indicators like health and well-being.
In some cities, significant income inequality is often closely
related to other types of inequalities. With its relatively high
consumption Gini coefficient of 0.64 in 2006, Lagos is among
the most unequal cities in sub-Saharan Africa. This is reflected
in shelter indicators such as living area and sanitation, as well
as in high unemployment rates among males. Nearly twofifths of Lagos residents live in overcrowded housing, and
a quarter have no access to adequate sanitation. The city is
also unable to provide jobs for its growing population, with
40 per cent of males and 12 per cent of females unemployed
in 2006. On the other hand in Mexico, income inequality
in Guadalajara is relatively low compared with other Latin
American cities, and this situation happens to be matched
by healthy shelter and social indicators; residents enjoy near-

universal access to safe water and sanitation, and almost all
are literate.
Surprisingly, slum prevalence or “ghettoization” may or may
not influence income inequality in any particular city. In some
of the most unequal cities in Latin America and the United
States, for instance, it is only a relatively small proportion of
the population that lives in slums or urban ghettos, and yet
inequality remains high. In those cities where poverty and
wealth are concentrated in specific areas, income inequality
measures may also fail to capture important dimensions of
the urban divide. For instance, Simi Valley, California, on
the outskirts of Los Angeles, enjoys a relatively low degree
of income inequality (with a Gini coefficient of 0.37)
because it is a relatively homogenous and wealthy “bedroom
community”, whose members are isolated from impoverished
or less wealthy communities within the city of Los Angeles.
Washington, D.C., on the other hand, is significantly more
unequal (0.537), which is reflected in the spatial division
of the U.S. capital by both wealth and race factors, with its
significant, and largely poor, black and Hispanic communities
concentrated in certain areas. The same pattern can also be
seen in New Orleans, with large pockets of wealth amid
populations that suffer from endemic poverty.

Box 2.2.6: Corruption feeds income inequality
Corruption and income inequality deprive
communities and the poor not only of material wealth, but also of opportunities and livelihoods. Generally defined as the misuse of public office for private gain, corruption can take
the form of “grand corruption”, when legislative and executive bodies implement economic
policies for the benefit of a small segment of
the population; “legislative corruption”, when
under lobbyists’ influence lawmakers favour
specific interest groups; and “bureaucratic corruption”, when officials seek bribes.
All types of corruption take advantage of structural deficiencies in the political, judicial and
economic institutions of developing countries
that are already stacked against the poor. 
Empirical research into the causal relationship
between corruption and income inequality
suggests that it would take only a 10 per cent

decrease in corruption to increase GDP growth
by 2.8 per cent in Africa, 2.6 per cent in Latin
America and the Caribbean, and 1.7 per cent
in OECD and Asian countries. Africa is where
corruption is most detrimental to economic
growth, and Latin America where the phenomenon most deeply affects income equality. Researchers infer that a one-standard-deviation
decrease in corruption would lower the Gini
coefficient of income distribution (on a 0 to 1
scale) by 0.05 point in the OECD area, 0.14
point in Asia, 0.25 point in Africa, and 0.33
point in Latin America.
Corruption has pervasive social and economic
consequences, and policymakers’ failure to
tackle these as part of broader efforts to promote equity and equality only encourages a
vicious cycle of interrelated increases in both
corruption and income inequality. Corruption
stymies economic growth and therefore can

affect income distribution, economists have
shown; sociologists have found that the reverse
is also true: income inequality can increase corruption if the phenomenon is considered as acceptable behaviour in an unequal society.
Corruption makes public spending less efficient, especially in vital welfare and education
areas. In Uganda, only 13 per cent of central
government spending on some educational
programmes reached its destination between
1991 and 1994.
Specific policies, or attempts to strengthen
financial and legal monitoring schemes, are
not enough to tackle corruption; also required
are quick and efficient prosecution of offenders
and anti-poverty, redistributive policies. Targeting corruption without addressing its systemic
counterpart, inequality, may doom anti-corruption efforts to failure.

The Economic Divide – Urban Income Inequalities

The Spatial Divide

©Bernd Decker

Marginalization and its
Outcomes

Quick Facts	
1.	 The urban spatial divide is more than the
physical expression of income inequalities
among households; it is also a by-product of
inefficient land and housing markets.
2.	 A spatial poverty trap occurs when physical
distance to the city centre (and the associated
benefits and opportunities) turns into social
distance.
3.	 The poverty trap involves a combination of
six factors: poor job opportunities, living
conditions and social interactions; and high
rates of gender disparities, social exclusion
and criminality.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

4.	 Schemes and policies to reduce social
disparities have been reported in only onethird of the African, Asian and Latin American
countries under review.

82

5.	 Inequality in all its forms is detrimental to
any society, and when it becomes excessive
inequality poses a danger to social stability and
sustained economic growth.

Policy Points	
1.	 Absence of policy coordination between or
within national and local government constrains
cities’ ability to meet the requirements of urban
development and to deploy strategies that
mitigate spatial inequality.
2.	 Social policies should not be devised
exclusively as nationwide programmes if they
are effectively to address the determinants of
spatial inequality in cities and, more generally,
the urban divide.
3.	 More gender-specific schemes, like maternity
and childcare benefits, vocational training,
protecting women’s rights at the workplace,
and micro-credit are required if women are to
be lifted out of the spatial poverty trap.

The spatial dimension of inequality:
The poverty trap

I

nequalities in cities are not only about income and
consumption expenditures; they also reflect entrenched
patterns of urban development and ownership of
physical space. Whereas cities in the developed world
tend to facilitate social and economic mixing by encouraging
diverse land uses, providing various types of housing (social,
low-income, middle class), and developing transportation
systems that facilitate urban mobility, numerous cities of the
South are characterized by stark segregation between rich and
poor. Socioeconomic clustering in cities of the developing
world is a consequence of limited service and transportation
infrastructure, coupled with lack of housing choice. The poor,
unable to afford land or shelter in the limited areas of the city
that are fully serviced, have access only to the least desirable
and most densely developed spaces. The rich, on the other
hand, can invest in private housing on secluded properties,
often paying for their own water systems, electricity generators
and road maintenance.
Income inequality effectively restricts available options
when it comes to choosing the best residential location based
on factors such as proximity to jobs, schools and institutions;
neighborhood preferences and housing types; access to credit
opportunities and economic incentives; and other factors.
While income inequalities are a main dividing factor between
different social areas, the spatial inequalities visible in so many
cities are also an outgrowth of broader-ranging processes
of urban development, governance and institutionalized
exclusion of specific groups.
As discussed in Chapter 1.3, the separation between rich
and poor takes many forms in the cities of the developing
world. In some, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, large
numbers of slum households are clustered in specific areas
that dominate the cityscape, and can represent as much as
80 per cent of all urban neighbourhoods. This is the case,
for instance, in Bangui, Central Africa Republic; N’Djamena,
Chad; Niamey, Niger; and the cities of Addis Ababa, Maputo
and Luanda. In other cities, such as Kathmandu, Almaty,
Managua, Guatemala City and Cotonou, to name just a few,
poor neighborhoods hosting a mix of slum and non-slum
households are clearly visible at the periphery of the city, in

the decaying urban centres, or in scattered “slum islands”
in the interstices of formal, fully serviced settlements. The
spatial divide in such cities constitutes more than the physical
expression of income inequalities among households; it is also
a by-product of the inefficient land and housing markets that
force non-poor and middle-income households to reside in
slum areas for lack of better alternatives.
When slum areas are physically isolated and disconnected
from the main urban fabric, residents become cut off from
the city, often enduring longer commuting times and higher
transportation costs than they would if their neighbourhoods
were more integrated into city systems. Residents of such
settlements find themselves facing problems related not
only to low incomes or shelter deprivations, but also to
the social distance between themselves and those who have
greater access to the opportunities and amenities of the city.
Combined, the physical and social distance between poor and
rich neighbourhoods represents a spatial poverty trap marked
by six distinct challenges:
Severe job restrictions. Opportunities for work around
slum settlements in remote areas may be restricted, leaving
residents vulnerable to unemployment. For example, in
Mexico, 20 per cent of workers spend more than three hours

commuting to and from work every day. Long-distance
commuting is exacerbated by inefficient and costly public
transport systems, which add to the fragmentation of the
urban economy and further divide the urban space, to the
detriment of slum dwellers.
Gender disparities. Evidence shows that women from
isolated slum areas are effectively forced to work closer to
home than men because of the variety of risks they may face,
such as exposure to crime and difficulty in accessing transport.
Women often also need to be closer to home than men to care
for family members and carry out household responsibilities.
In the Sanjay slum in Delhi, for instance, 75 per cent of men
have been found to work within 12 kilometres of their homes,
whereas 75 per cent of women worked within a radius of
only 5 kilometres of home, showing how their employment
opportunities are restricted.
Worsening living conditions. Spatial mismatches between
job location and place of residence can leave more remote
slum-dwellers little alternative but to spend the night in
public spaces, squat in temporary units devoid of adequate
services, or share houses in overcrowded conditions. In Rio
de Janeiro, some workers sleep on beaches during the week,
saving commuting time as well as transportation costs that

consume at least 20 per cent of their wages. Similarly in
Dhaka and Mumbai, slum-dwelling workers are often found
sleeping on the pavement, travelling home only for weekends
and holidays.
Social exclusion and marginalization. In neighbourhoods
with poor connections to the city, permanent access to health
and education facilities is difficult, not only on account of
physical accessibility, but also because of the costs and time
involved in transportation. In Mumbai, for instance, 50 per
cent of slums have no access to primary schools, a percentage
that is even higher in the informal areas on the outskirts of the
city. In Chittagong, the number of kindergarten schools for
relatively well-to-do households is on the increase, while many
children in distant slums have almost no access to education.
Lack of social interaction. Physical segregation in terms
of distance, time and costs reduces the opportunities for
members of different income groups to interact. As a result,
social capital in its various forms is built only among the
poor, or based on other affinities such as ethnicity. In such
conditions, the positive effects of social capital are neutralized,
because interaction among unemployed people for instance,
does not increase employment opportunities. In those distant
and isolated neighbourhoods that effectively function as
spatial poverty traps, it is more likely that social interaction
can eventually encourage crime, as a strong sense of rejection
can lead to anti-social behaviour.
High incidence of crime. When confined to remote
locations, slum dwellers are also penalized by reduced access
to the various opportunities the city has to offer. Longdistance commuting in dark, underserved areas increases the
risk of crime. The poor are more defenceless than other social
groups and often rank among the prime victims of urban
crime. However, they also rank among the perpetrators. In
São Paulo, for instance, the number of homicides in some
isolated neighbourhoods has been reported to be more than
five times as high as in the safest districts.
The survey conducted in 2009 by UN-HABITAT in 27 selected cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America points to some
of the fundamental policy roots of spatial inequality. (See
Chapter 2.1 for the survey methodology.) In the absence of policy
coordination between national, local or other tiers of government, cities are clearly constrained in their ability to meet the
requirements of regional development and to deploy strategies
that would mitigate spatial inequality. The survey shows that
in cities in Latin America, both national and local authorities
were involved in urban policy initiatives, while in Asia and
Africa, national policies were predominant without commensurate regional or local implementation at the city level.
Another important factor behind policy dysfunction
is that social policies are often formulated as national
programmes, with little if any consideration for local
conditions or geographical scope, in the process overlooking
regional asymmetries and specific needs. When determined
solely at national level, social policies ignore the specific
spatial inequalities that must be addressed in the congested

and highly competitive urban and regional environments.
Regarding social disparities, only fewer than 35 per cent of
all respondents to the UN-HABITAT questionnaire reported
that schemes were in place to reduce them in African, Asian
and Latin American cities. Respondents also reported that
such urban public services or goods as waste collection,
recreation facilities, public parks and free spaces were largely
unavailable in all three regions. Inter-regional comparisons
show that Latin America fares significantly better than the
other two regions, although the level remains quite low.
On gender equality, UN-HABITAT survey returns
suggest that apart from setting minimum percentages for
female employees in the public and private sectors, all other
gender-specific schemes (maternity and childcare benefits,
provision of specific skills and vocational training, protecting
women’s rights at the workplace, micro-credit facilities) are
largely lacking in all three regions, with fewer than 25 per
cent of respondents reporting that any of these were in place,
particularly in remote and isolated slum settlements. Moreover,
the incidence of policy initiatives in support of informal sector
employment – either through job enhancement or legalization
of certain informal sector activities – was, again, found to be
very low in all three regions.
The central role played by economic inclusiveness may be
best understood from a contrarian perspective: economic
exclusion automatically tends to drive individuals out of the
social, political and cultural spheres, resulting in a “capabilities”
constraint.1 In this process, the poor are made poorer by the
other forms of marginalization they are subjected to, and are
excluded from those opportunities that help create capabilities
of any kind in the first place. As the survey findings for
Bogotá demonstrate, poverty acts as a major hindrance to any
effective “right to the city”.
The interrelationships between the economic and other three
dimensions of inclusiveness (or otherwise) are such that, over
time, social, political and cultural exclusion tend to undermine
the very possibility of equal economic opportunities. Countries
and cities are subject to changing historical factors that make
their development path-dependent, and they are challenged
by internal factors that only add to divisiveness. These include
divisions based on racial, ethnic, religious and other political
allegiance factors. Despite efforts to provide an equal basis
for all individuals in society in the three regions (through
the national constitution, affirmative action laws and other
such regulatory measures), enforcement of these rights seems
to be weak and tends to reinforce various forms of exclusion
over time. UN-HABITAT survey findings clearly show this
to be the case. Over the past two to three decades, public
authorities in the three regions under review have largely
failed to deploy the sustainable policies required to reduce the
urban divide on a scale commensurate with their respective
urban growth rates. Even more importantly, survey returns
on average point to a clear lack of coordination between (in
most cases) national policies and (in some instances) the local
level as well as to poor concerted action to address the spatial
divide which, in many cases, turns into a poverty trap.

UNIFEM’s Progress of the World’s Women 2008/9
report notes that owing to women’s limited decision-making power within the household, their
relationship to the public sphere or to markets is
often mediated by men. This means that women
may not be in a position to make important decisions about what services the household should
prioritize, as they are often under pressure to
favour the needs of males over those of others
in the family. Women’s lack of agency in the
household has severe consequences with regard
to their access to services such as health care
and education.
Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1999 and 2005 showed that more than
half of married women in sub-Saharan Africa and
South Asia had no say over decisions regarding
their own health care. In both regions, women
also wielded little decision-making power over
daily household purchases. Moreover, more
than 40 per cent of married women in both subSaharan Africa and South Asia reported that they
were not allowed to visit relatives when they

Stark differences have been noted, however,
between married women in South Asia and others in the eastern part of the continent. Married
women in East Asia are among the most emancipated in the developing world. Surveys show
that large numbers in this region not only make
final decisions regarding their own health care,
but are almost completely in charge of what to
purchase for the household and what to cook
for dinner. While this may reflect gender-based
roles in which women are expected to carry out
domestic chores, women in this region also exercise control over other aspects of their lives.
Unlike their sisters in South Asian countries such
as India, Afghanistan and Pakistan, more than
90 per cent of women in this region do not need
their spouses’ permission to visit relatives.

ing water can involve walking long distances
for long stretches of time. Recent research on
sub-Saharan Africa suggests that women spend
some 40 billion hours a year collecting water –
the equivalent of a year’s worth of labour by the
entire workforce in France. Capital expenditure
on access to water provision for households
would release substantial amounts of women’s
time on a day-to-day basis, opening up fresh
opportunities, including self-improvement. Similarly, when women have little say if any in their
own health care, they are in no position to make
important decisions about the number of children
they should have or whether or not to use contraception. In extreme cases, it may also mean that
they are likely not to get treatment when they
need it, and are therefore vulnerable to debilitating injuries and early death. Similarly, women’s
lack of decision-making powers in other areas
concerning the household, including children’s
opportunities, hardly puts them in a good position to make sure their children go to school or
receive adequate nutrition.

At a much more fundamental level, lack of a
voice when deciding which services to prioritize
has serious consequences. For instance, in most
societies, women are in charge of domestic
chores, such as washing, cleaning and cooking.
When access to water is limited or non-existent,
it is for women to ensure that their families have
enough water for drinking and bathing. Retriev-

Since any country’s development is intimately
linked to how well or badly its female population
is faring, it is clear that women’s low status within the household is severely hampering progress
in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa – the two
regions that have consistently been rated by the
United Nations as the world’s poorest with the
worst health, education and shelter indicators.

chose. The notion that women “rule the roost”
was evidently not borne out by DHS statistics,
which further showed that one in five women in
sub-Saharan Africa did not even have the final
say over what food to cook.

The Spatial Divide – Marginalization and its Outcomes

Most household surveys fail to capture any differences in access to services, or control over
resources, among members of the same household. This comes in stark disregard of the fact
that intra-household inequalities are increasingly
recognized as detrimental to the social and economic advancement of women.

The intangible dimensions of spatial inequality

of income.3 The proportion of people living in extreme poverty
in Brazil – one of the world’s most unequal countries with
a Gini coefficient of 0.566 – is relatively low (4.2 per cent)
compared with other middle-income emerging economies;
still, poverty incidence remains linked to skin colour and area
of residence. In 2005, poverty levels were three times higher in
rural areas than in cities, and were particularly severe among
Afro-descendents. Brazil’s 2007 National Monitoring Report
indicates that blacks represented 73.5 per cent of the poorest
10 per cent of the population, although they contributed less
than 8 per cent of the population.
Still in Brazil, many black and indigenous children remain
out of primary school, and 7.5 million people still live in
extreme poverty.4 In some cities, socially marginalized groups
are heavily concentrated in slums, and therefore suffer most
from lack of access to decent shelter and opportunities; this is
especially the case when their neighbourhoods are located far
away from the city, and the long commutes penalize them in
terms of cost and time. In the Indian city of Jaipur, for instance,
underprivileged (“scheduled”) castes and tribes5 contribute 61
per cent of the slum population, although they represent only
a combined 16.1 per cent of the total city population.6
Results of the 2009 UN-HABITAT survey show that in all
the 27 selected cities in the three regions under review, those
places where the urban poor and slum dwellers earn a living
are systematically excluded from mainstream economic, social,
cultural and political programmes and initiatives. When asked
to rank the most vulnerable groups in their respective cities for
the purposes of the UN-HABITAT survey, experts reckoned
that along with the disabled and the elderly, slum dwellers
and the urban poor were the most vulnerable in terms of
exclusion. The economic marginalization of the urban poor
was further evidenced by the reported length of their daily
commutes: an average one to two hours one way, amounting
to nearly four hours a day.

Spatial inequality reaches beyond physical space constraints
to include “inequality space”. This specific component has
a different effect across social categories such as women and
children, ethnic groups and races, the elderly and the disabled.
On the whole, these groups have been largely overlooked
in policy discourses on inequality, and not just in urban
contexts. For example, until recently, most household surveys
failed to capture the inequalities women have to face up to
within the household. Although the surveys collected data on
gender-disaggregated indicators, such as literacy among boys
compared with girls, they did not adequately reflect girls’ or
women’s lack of access to other resources and opportunities.
Updated data in Demographic and Health Surveys shows that
intra-household inequalities often take the form of a lack of
decision-making power among women in the household.2 A
large proportion of women in South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa, for instance, have no final say in decisions regarding
their own health. (See Box 2.3.1.)
Household surveys often fail to capture other aspects of
“voicelessness” in women’s conditions, such as whom to marry
and when, especially where arranged marriages are the norm.
While gender inequality is generally understood as a central
dimension of general inequality, social scientists have been
struggling to integrate these dimensions into mainstream data
collection methodologies, partly because of the difficulties
inherent in collecting and measuring such data. Similarly,
income inequality measures often fail to reflect racial and ethnic
differences in access to resources. Research in India, Indonesia,
Mexico and Tanzania shows that although in general the poor
systematically receive lower quality health care than the rich,
the situation is often worse for ethnic minorities. In Mexico,
for instance, indigenous groups were shown to receive worse
health care from both public and private providers, regardless

How other deprivations reinforce the spatial divide
in Figure 2.3.5, poverty reduction in all regions is closely
associated with average annual growth in per capita income.11
The most remarkable example is that of East Asia, where
high growth over the past three decades (thanks to pro-poor
policies) has brought about substantial reductions in poverty,
reducing the percentage of the population living on US $1.25
or less from 78 per cent in 1981 to 17 per cent in 2005.
Conversely, those regions with stagnant or weak economic
growth and without clear pro-poor policies have failed to
achieve significant reductions in poverty: in sub-Saharan
African countries, the percentage of the population living on
US $1.25 a day has remained almost constant at around 50
per cent over the past three decades.12
Far from being yet another significant, specific phenomenon,
inequality should clearly become a central focus of development
policies. Inequality is as much about social justice, political
freedom and cultural expression as it is about economic
opportunities, which, in turn, determine income, wealth and
social standing. Failure to account for the social, political,
cultural and economic dimensions of exclusion and inequality
results in a distribution of opportunities that is predetermined
by unfair criteria, and only manages to entrench exclusion in a
systematic way, to the detriment of urban growth.
Findings from the 2009 UN-HABITAT survey point to
a strong correlation in the three regions between economic
exclusiveness on the one hand, and social, cultural and
political equality on the other. Figure 2.3.6 illustrates the
four aspects of inclusiveness along a spectrum ranging from
“not inclusive at all” (0 on the X-axis) to “highly inclusive”
(4 on the X-axis). While, as expected, no city was found to
be fully inclusive (rating 5), none was totally exclusive either
(rating 1). Most were concentrated between ratings of 2
(low inclusiveness) and 4 (high inclusiveness). As one would
expect, a large number of the cities were given a rating of 3
(denoting partial inclusiveness) for most or all four dimensions
of inclusiveness. It must be stressed here that the specific
ratings for Chittagong, New Delhi, Abuja, Dakar, Mombasa,
Oruro and Port-au-Prince indicate that the four dimensions
are inter-related. Therefore, beyond a confirmation of the
central role of economic inclusiveness, this goes to show its
interrelations with other forms of equality – and the need for
cities to provide opportunities for all types of inclusiveness.

The Spatial Divide – Marginalization and its Outcomes

A significant body of literature on income distribution
provides evidence that inequalities are detrimental to any
society in terms of social stability and economic inefficiency.
High-income groups in feudal or monopolistic economies
may, for instance, protect themselves from free competition
by buying political influence, in the process distorting
markets and making democratic governance institutions less
accountable. Highly unequal societies are also associated with
reduced social mobility.
Whatever the various combinations of the six factors behind
the poverty traps outlined above, they militate in favour of
a shift in emphasis – one from inequalities in outcomes to
inequalities in opportunities. This shift is critical to any proper
understanding not just of equality outcomes in any given
city, but also, and more importantly, of the root causes of the
urban divide. In turn, shifting the emphasis from outcomes to
opportunities enhances the importance of inequality on both
normative and instrumental grounds. On normative grounds,
inequalities of opportunity are deemed unethical from the
point of view of social justice, as they are determined by
morally irrelevant circumstances. On instrumental grounds,
inequalities of opportunity are deemed important from an
efficiency perspective, as they can have negative repercussions
on economic performance.7
The potential negative impact of unequal opportunities is
also important with regard to poverty reduction, particularly
in developing countries. Whatever the trend in economic
growth, the more unequal the distribution of income and
the less the poor stand to benefit, in accounting terms.8
Inequality might also be linked to persistent poverty even
in growth scenarios: evidence shows that greater land-related
and educational inequality reduces income growth for the
poorest quintile about twice as much as that of all quintiles.9
These dynamics might highlight the positive relationship
between poverty and inequality across countries, as shown
in Figure 2.3.4. Specifically, countries with greater income
inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) tend to
feature higher incidences of poverty relative to respective
national poverty lines.10
To the extent that inequality can slow down growth as it
introduces inefficiencies in the allocation of resources, it can
also have an indirect effect on poverty reduction. As shown

The Opportunity
Divide

When the “Urban Advantage”
eludes the poor

Quick Facts	
1.	 Globalization can stimulate economic growth in
cities and, with proper redistributive policies,
help alleviate poverty. However, it can also
exacerbate the urban divide.
2.	 About 85 per cent of all new employment
opportunities around the world occur in the
informal economy.
3.	 Young people in slums are more likely to
work in the informal sector than their non-slum
peers. Despite some advantages, informal
employment ends up trapping slum-dwelling
and other low-income young people in
perpetual poverty.
4.	 Among people living in poverty in the
developing world, employment opportunities,
whether formal or informal, are skewed in
favour of young men, who are twice as likely to
find gainful employment as young women.

Policy Points

1.	 The particular ways cities are planned,
designed and built says much about what
is valued there, and the control of planning
processes can help or hinder the development
of opportunities for all.
2.	 “World class city” strategies are a legitimate
way of taking advantage of globalization, but
they should include a sustainable, inclusive
dimension that also benefits the poor.
3.	 Large-scale, labour-intensive infrastructure
and urban improvement works could provide
gainful employment to the poor while granting
them their fair share in the “urban advantage”.
These labour-intensive programmes are to be
combined with vocational training and skill
development activities.
4.	 Continued emphasis on expanding
opportunities for girls and young women will
be an essential requirement if the Millennium
Development Goals are to be met in cities.

Weak institutions

I

n every country in the world, access to the “urban
advantage” and distribution of the related benefits in
terms of opportunities, employment, services, etc., is
determined by various organizations and institutions
– including, crucially, the formal land and labour markets as
well as public utilities. The problem in developing countries
is that most of these institutions are weak or dysfunctional,
exposing them to undue influence from, or capture by, vested
domestic or foreign interests. In some cities, necessary public
institutions are lacking altogether, in which case essentially
private vested interests fill the void and act as substitutes for
institutions that would otherwise prioritize the interests of
society at large. In both situations, the markets for land, basic
services and labour are skewed in favour of private interests,
enabling these to claim more than their fair share of the
benefits of the “urban advantage”. In this process, young slum
dwellers, particularly women, are deprived of the formal,
secure livelihoods that could lift them up and out of the
dire socioeconomic outcomes associated with the informal,
insecure conditions in which they are forced to live.
Inequitable and divisive land and planning policies
Institutional capture by interest group factions or other
coalitions in the developing world results in the apportionment
to only a select few of opportunities that should be shared
by all. The particular ways cities are planned, designed and
built says much about what is valued there, and the control
of planning processes can help or hinder the development of
opportunities for all. While urban planning has the potential
to promote urban harmony and bridge the urban divide
through an equitable distribution of city amenities, it has
too often been used as an instrument of exclusion. Indeed,
powerful members of society have used “master planning” to
capture land and provide infrastructure, manipulating land
use patterns in favour of the gentrification of entire areas in
cities. In the process, massive displacement has taken place
to make room for highways, skyscrapers, luxury compounds
or shopping malls, to the detriment of the habitats and
livelihoods of the poor. This is a worldwide phenomenon. The
bulldozing of the vibrant slums of Maroko, Lagos, has led to

including pockets of severe poverty. Such dispossession and
housing distress also fuel the rise in homelessness as entire
families find themselves forced to live on the streets for lack
of better alternatives. These conditions deny poor people the
benefits of the urban advantage and have serious implications
particularly for women’s safety, health and access to education
and employment opportunities.
An especially divisive aspect of urbanization has been the
recent rapid expansion of gated communities and other
protected enclaves of wealth. As more and more tracts of land
and civic services are monopolized by those with the most
resources, urban amenities are systematically denied to residents
with lower incomes. In Shanghai, for example, the advent of
gated communities has given the better-off an opportunity to
set up what are seen as “civilized” communities away from the
perceived “uncivilized” and much-stigmatized underclass of
rural immigrants.1 In São Paulo, too, gated communities have
increasingly given the upper class an opportunity to withdraw
into their own enclaves, inevitably creating a contrast between
the safe and familiar inside and a “threatening” and “unknown”
outside.2 This trend is particularly evident in Dubai, a de facto
if overstretched gated community rooted in commercial
interests, which was deliberately built as a “global city” in a
bid to attract upper-class investors and residents from all over
the world. Behind the facade of luxury, though, lies a dire dayto-day reality for thousands of Filipino, Indian and Pakistani
immigrant workers who are barred from local citizenship (and
related rights), housed in camps on the periphery in extremely
precarious conditions, and subject to extensive working hours
as well as tight and heavy social control.
On top of spatial segregation, gated communities and
protected enclaves of wealth also result in social and economic
segregation, and even outright social exclusion. In South
Africa, for example, the persistence and even expansion of
gated communities is seen as the continuation of “apartheid
geography”, which continues to separate the rich and poor
from each other, creating an environment of exclusion that
militates against the much-lauded post-apartheid goals
of social mixing, integration and inclusion.3 Exclusive
developments create a barrier to interaction among people
of different ethic groups, races, religions, cultures, and
classes, inhibiting the construction of social networks that
allow for social mobility and economic development.4 It also
happens frequently that gated communities interfere with
efficient urban management and civic functions by limiting
access to high-quality schools, health-care centres, libraries,
parks and other amenities. In some cases – in Johannesburg
and Pretoria, for instance – public facilities located in the
vicinity of gated developments have also been enclosed,
forcing non-residents to negotiate controlled access points
in order to benefit from those collective services as part of
their daily routines. Moreover, public transport to enclosed,
exclusive communities may be limited or unavailable; this is
all the more deplorable as businesses within these communities
frequently rely upon low-wage workers who live elsewhere, and
therefore force them to find alternative means of transport if any.

The Opportunity Divide – When the “Urban Advantage” eludes the poor

the displacement of 300,000 residents; the government-led
destruction of Harare and Bulawayo (known as “Operation
Murambatsvina”, or “drive out trash”) has been associated
with large numbers of arrests and killings, as well as
ransacking and the dislocation of more than 700,000 people;
and in Shanghai, deliberate gentrification of neighbourhoods
between 1991 and 1997 led to the relocation of 1.5 million
people, the same number as those displaced by Rangoon’s
tourism-oriented makeover.
On top of displacing the poor, these self-serving planning
policies also fail to provide adequate low-cost housing
alternatives, making them all the more inequitable. Such
government- and market-induced actions force millions to
live in unsuitable, insecure conditions, often characterized
by a lack of basic services and serious health threats. Public
authorities further exacerbate the housing crisis through
failures on four major counts: (1) lack of land titles and
other forms of secure tenure; (2) cutbacks in funds for social
housing; (3) lack of land reserves earmarked for low-income
housing; and (4) inability to intervene in the market to
control land and property speculation. Furthermore, urban
renewal and redevelopment efforts sometimes result in the
demolition of homes and relocation of thousands to areas
which, being far removed from livelihood opportunities, result
in further impoverishment for those already on low incomes.
Ironically, the very “renewal” that often comes associated with
goals as “cities without slums” can contribute to the urban
divide, with all sorts of inequalities in both opportunities
and outcomes. In many cities around the world, renewal
and redevelopment have caused a most visible burgeoning
of slums and inadequately serviced informal settlements,

91

“Global” vs. local urban advantage
As reflected in the limited resources available for good
schooling, health and other facilities, unequal opportunities create “minorities in the marketplace”, whose individual
members are automatically excluded from a wide range of the
outcomes associated with economic growth and globalization
– including demand for a skilled and healthy labour force.
Moreover, markets are not as transparent as one would assume
and benefits do not trickle down in any automatic way, if at
all. In most cases, government intervention is required if opportunities and benefits are to be fairly apportioned across the
population. In many cities of the developing world, globalization imposes an unfair pattern of dispensation, whereby those
already well placed – such as government officials and the political and economic elites – benefit the most.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Privatization of basic services

92

Basic services make a significant contribution to the
“urban advantage”, and together with employment feature
high among the aspirations of those who move to cities in
search of a brighter future. Economic liberalization has added
further momentum to an ongoing trend toward privatization
of basic utilities, including water, electricity and sanitation.
In developing countries, private interests have often filled the
gap left by public authorities and their inability to provide
affordable access to such basic commodities as water, often
putting them out of financial reach of the most vulnerable
and marginalized segments of society. Privatization of basic
services (including through public-private partnerships) is
questionable when it fails properly to consider specific criteria
for access by the poor (such as preferential rates or subsidies).
Globalization can stimulate economic growth in cities and,
with proper redistributive policies, help alleviate poverty;
however, globalization can also exacerbate the urban divide.
Those at the bottom of the economic scale may actually
end up poorer, because while their incomes may not have
decreased, the gap between them and the rich has widened
at the same time as prices of basic services and facilities are
becoming more expensive with privatization. As stressed in
Chapter 2.5, environmental equity is an essential determinant
of health and mortality, especially for the urban poor. This is
why access to basic services like water and sanitation plays
a crucial role in poverty reduction and the improvement
in slum-dwellers’ living conditions, as mandated under the
Millennium Development Goals.
From a human rights perspective, critical evaluations of the
recent privatization of basic services have drawn three major
lessons:
1.	By its very nature, privatization is increasingly forcing
public authorities (both central and local) to become more
profit-oriented in the provision of essential services. Among
developing nations, where a significant proportion of the
population lives in poverty, many segments of society are
in no position to guarantee sufficient or adequate rates of

return to the shareholders of the private companies now
providing basic services. Therefore, unless the rates charged
by those utilities are subsidized in some way or another,
already underprivileged people will likely be forced to
forego basic services altogether.
2.	Private corporate entities place strong emphasis on profit
generation and cost recovery, which often has the effect of
fragmenting service scope and delivery. If no potential or
actual user can pay the full price for the new services, the
project may become financially unsustainable.
3.	Private operators are accountable to investors rather than
to the communities they serve. Of particular concern
are the growing incidences of unethical practices by
private suppliers and other institutions that aggressively
push for increased privatization. The need to strengthen
participatory monitoring mechanisms could not be more
acute, since privatization is extremely difficult to reverse
once effective.5
Displacing the urban poor to create “world-class” cities
In the developing world, global economic forces have led
to fierce competition among conurbations to become “worldclass” cities, namely, cities that generate high rates of profitability through provision of high-quality international financial,
professional and business services. Major cities are jockeying
for “world-class” status at the same time that the demonstrated effects of global economic flows and international policy
constraints appear to be rather mixed. Global economic investment creates new and unprecedented sources of wealth,
offering the promise of reduced poverty and broader access
to basic services; however, the fact remains that, within cities,
extreme poverty persists in a significant way. The raw numbers
of people enjoying better, more secure conditions, with access
to potable water, improved sanitation and sustainable livelihoods have increased as a result of economic prosperity and
redistributive policies; but some of the policy prescriptions
that have been imposed on developing country governments
to promote their integration into global economic flows are
not necessarily oriented to redistribution. Instead, they tend to
restrict government involvement in the provision of adequate
resources and services that are often of critical importance to
large majorities of their populations. Economic liberalization
is one of the factors behind the continuing deterioration in
the education, health, housing and related services on which a
majority of the urban poor depend.
Against this background of persistent inequality, aspiring
“world-class” cities take advantage of the improvements in
global connectivity that have facilitated a dramatic expansion
in cross-border networks and flows of goods, services and
finance.6 Some new world-class cities are emerging – or are
scheduled to emerge – in the developing world in such specific
areas as science, technology, financial management, and
knowledge. These cities often find themselves at the core of
new mega-regions, city-regions or urban corridors, attracting
both capital expenditure and workers (see Chapter 1.1). As

Laws and administrative policies
The persistence of discriminatory legislation, such as
anti-vagrancy and anti-beggary laws, combines with other
methods – interpretation of criminal law, anti-squatting laws,
misuse of anti-terrorist laws, new surveillance strategies and
“zero-tolerance” policies – to add to the marginalization of
vulnerable groups, such as the homeless, and even openly
turn them into declared targets. For example, India’s Bombay
Prevention of Beggary Act 1959 is routinely used to round
up the homeless, even when they are gainfully employed. For
municipal authorities, the problem also has to do with budget
constraints and choices. In Buenos Aires, the Municipal
Housing Institute had to cut its budgetary allocation by
nearly four from 519 to 120 million pesos (US $137 to 32
million) in 2009; concomitantly, over the past five years, the
city’s municipal security (i.e., police) budget has undergone a
tenfold increase.9
Today, various urban areas in developing countries suffer
from unemployment rates that are similar to those experienced
in the cities that were most severely affected by the Great
Depression in the United States of America.10 The only
difference is that in the developing world, the prospects for
cities to solve the unemployment issues they face in the short
or medium terms are poor, making these problems chronic.
For instance, Johannesburg reported unemployment rates of
33 per cent in 2005 and 30 per cent in 2007,11 which are
higher than those in Chicago when the city bore the brunt of
the depression in the 1930s. Local and national governments
together can design a number of programmes and schemes to
open up opportunities for all. This can include cash transfers,
support aid programmes and targeted social interventions
or specific support to the labour market in order to generate
jobs. In this section, we refer more specifically to employment
creation, as opposed to the other redistribution alternatives
that are addressed in Chapter 3.3 of this Report.

The Opportunity Divide – When the “Urban Advantage” eludes the poor

part of broader growth and development strategies, aiming
for world-class status makes sense for cities: such efforts
demonstrate entrepreneurial capacity, creativity, ambition
and a political determination to enhance a city’s potential.
However, problems consistently arise when ambitious
projects and policies are deployed at the expense or even to
the detriment of the poor, without authentically engaging
them in decisions that affect their lives.
This report argues that short of a sustainable vision, there
can be no inclusive cities. A sustainable vision, almost by
definition, combines optimism, ambition and innovation,
but it must also be realistic and holistic, encompassing all
segments of the city population. Some of the grand plans for
“world-class” cities are exclusionary, tending to overlook poor
and marginalized populations from the design stage through
the final outcome. In other cases, though, planning has taken
into account the whole urban population from inception,
deliberately ushering in a more equitable, spatially integrated
city. For instance, the “Kuala Lumpur City Plan 2020”
prioritizes not just economic prosperity and environmental
quality, but also social equity. The plan is shaped by social
concerns and aims to make the city more inclusive.7 Likewise,
the “Joburg 2030 Vision” scheme that was first developed
in 2001 has since been revisited, with the “Growth and
Development Strategy 2006 (“Joburg GDS”), to integrate
some dimensions of social and economic inclusiveness that
had been overlooked early on. As it stands now, the Joburg
GDS stresses the need for more extensive opportunities for
all in the economic sector, in a bid to address any remaining
inequalities that have been identified. The new city vision
clearly states that “…the benefits of balanced economic
growth will be shared in a way that enables all residents to
gain access to the ladders of prosperity, and where the poor,
vulnerable and excluded will be supported out of poverty to
realize upward social mobility…”8

Employment: A mis-shared urban advantage

94

In the dreams of all those who move there, cities foster the
healthy development of children and young people, providing
easier access to education, health care and employment than
is available in rural areas. As they soon find out, though,
not all who grow up in cities benefit from this other major
component of the “urban advantage”, because no city offers
all children and young people a single, undivided urban
condition.12 Cities can generate and intensify the kind of
social exclusion that denies most of the up-and-coming
generation and other marginalized groups the benefits of
urban life, particularly against a contrasted background of
unprecedented urban growth and increasing poverty and
inequality. Indeed, these two opposite trends can be found to
coexist within the confines of a single city.
Developing and developed countries alike face an
employment crisis, but the causes are different. While in
developed countries, the scarcity of jobs is a consequence of
the recent financial and economic crunch, in the developing
world unemployment is endemic and the global financial
crisis is only making it even worse. In most developing
countries, the working-age population is growing much
faster than new, gainful employment opportunities. Most of
these countries are experiencing an “employment transition”,
with more and more people seeking non-agricultural work,
and mainly in urban areas. This is part of the general
industrial trends in Africa, Asia and Latin America as they
move to manufacturing-based economies, while those
countries that had already reached that stage are moving
toward high technology and services. Some cities and regions
(for instance, Bangalore and New Delhi in India) are moving
straight from agriculture-based to high-technology and
services provision without any significant manufacturing

transition to speak of, contrary to the established historical
pattern. Unconventional or not, though, these economic
transitions come as a major socio-economic challenge for
urban areas, insofar as they have been unable to generate
sufficient numbers of durable job opportunities in the
manufacturing or service sectors that could provide gainful
employment to people migrating from rural areas. In a sharp
contrast to the North, urbanization in many developing
countries has taken place without commensurate increases
in productive employment or increases in agricultural
productivity that could sustain rural areas while feeding
cities at more affordable prices for all.
In addition to the endemic job crisis, most developing
countries have had to deal with the consequences of the
financial and economic crisis that since 2008 has caused
significant labour market deterioration in all parts of the
world. The risk is that this deterioration may, in turn, trigger
serious social and political tension in a number of countries.
In a recent analysis, the International Labour Organization
(ILO) suggested that the crisis might be much deeper
and broader, and might last much longer, than initially
anticipated.13 However, the pace and nature of its impact varies
quite significantly across regions and countries depending on
economic structure, policy constraints and other specificities.
Some countries are more vulnerable than others, particularly
those where people on low incomes are heavily dependent
on remittances from abroad. From a more general point of
view, the ongoing crisis is likely to reverse any modest gains
many developing countries had been making lately in terms
of growth, poverty reduction and job creation. The resulting
significant effects may outlast the crisis.

Girls and young women living in poverty in cities consistently face steeper challenges than their male peers. ©Jacob Silberberg/Panos Pictures

Even before the global financial crisis began to affect
the developing world, data on urban young people’s
access to education and livelihoods showed that against a
general background of persistent deprivation and endemic
unemployment, the benefits of the “urban advantage” eluded
some specific groups, and women in particular. Girls and young
women living in poverty in cities consistently face steeper
challenges than their male peers when it comes to acquiring
the knowledge and skills they need to live healthy, productive
lives. Continued emphasis on expanded opportunities for girls
and young women, therefore, will be an essential requirement
if the Millennium Development Goals are to be met in cities.
Young slum dwellers are more likely to have a child, be
married or head a household than their counterparts in nonslum areas – a phenomenon that acts as a further challenge to
female access to the “urban advantage”. The majority of young
female slum dwellers tend to bear children at an earlier age
than their non-slum counterparts: this is the case in Uganda,
where six out 10 young women living in slums have a child
or are married, or twice as many as in non-slum communities
(by comparison, 34 per cent of young Ugandans in slum areas
head a household, compared with 5 per cent of those in nonslum areas.) In many places, young women serve as unpaid
carers of children or other family members.
All these situations combine to make young women
particularly likely to stay out of the income-earning workforce
and miss out on opportunities for decent, durable gainful
employment. Those women who do work in developing
countries tend to do so in the informal economy, owing
to lack of formal job opportunities in many regions. For
example, in Dhaka most of the jobs performed by women
in garment and textile or food processing firms are of an

informal nature, although many of them are the main breadearners for their families. In the absence of organized labour
markets, only small numbers of women have access to formal
employment with the associated benefits (social security, paid
and parental leave, retirement and unemployment money);
instead, most women find themselves dependent upon the
informal economy for their own and their family’s survival.
In sub-Saharan Africa, 84 per cent of women’s nonagricultural employment is informal. Few are employed
in the formal economy, and those who do are frequently
confined to “traditionally female”, or “pink collar”, jobs
with the low status, poor job security and low pay typically
shunned by men. In some areas, however, women and men
are competing for low-status jobs in sales and other services.
Women also fall victims to discriminatory stereotyping, or to
the fact that family responsibilities make them less available
for full-time employment.
As far as youth non-employment is concerned (an ingrained,
endemic phenomenon), rates are also generally much higher
for females than males. Non-employment refers to situations
that are typical of countries with poor labour market structures,
where a young working-age individual is neither at school
nor employed or formally registered as a job-seeker. In most
African countries, the female non-employment rate is around
40 per cent, or twice as much as for males. By comparison,
in those countries where the labour market is formal and
well-organized, the unemployment rates of both young
women and men are quite similar; in less organized labour
markets, unemployment tends to be under-reported and data
collection is difficult. For instance, in Quito, the official rate of
unemployment is around 7 per cent, but the experts surveyed
reckon the actual figure to be some three times higher. They
also estimate that in the Ecuadoran capital, under-employment
affects 45 per cent of the working population.14

The informal sector: Gateway or trap for youth?

96

In developing countries, confinement of slum-dwelling
women to largely informal jobs provides a stark illustration of
a wider phenomenon whereby the formal, secure livelihoods
that typically accompany the “urban advantage” elude too
many among the urban population. In most developing
countries, trends suggest that urban economies have become
increasingly informal over the past 10 years, as the formal
sector consistently fails to provide for both young people
and adults seeking employment, even in the face of healthy
economic growth. In India, for example, whose economy grew
at a 5 per cent annual rate over the past 10 years, some 370
million people, or 9 out of 10 employees, are not affiliated
with any formal social security scheme. Mexico, which grew
an average 2.5 per cent per year in the past 10 years, extends
social security to only 30 per cent of its workforce.
About 85 per cent of all new employment opportunities
around the world occur in the informal economy, but
this is not without some beneficial effects. For the young,
these include opportunities for work experience and selfemployment. Part-time, seasonal and contract work in both
the formal and informal economies also counts as informal
employment. Tracking the number of young people employed
in the informal sector is a challenge for a number of reasons,
though, and currently available data is inadequate.15 UNHABITAT analysis suggests that the majority of young people
working in the urban informal sector live in slum areas. For
example, in Benin, slum dwellers comprise 75 per cent of
informal sector workers, while in Burkina Faso, the Central
African Republic, Chad and Ethiopia, the proportion is as
large as 90 per cent.
With its combination of job insecurity, low wages and
dangerous work, the informal sector should provide no more
than a short-term solution to urban unemployment. Formal job
creation can be so scarce, though, that informal employment
ends up trapping slum-dwelling and other low-income young
people in perpetual poverty. With the financial and economic
crisis, job losses are also pushing more people deeper into the
informal economy or outright poverty. As construction projects
are interrupted, for example, builders lose their jobs and the
street vendors who served them lose customers. A slowdown
in tourist and other leisure activities also has repercussions for
the informal sector. These are the losses that unemployment
statistics fail to capture – and that are likely to be overlooked
in efforts to stimulate new employment.
Unemployment, the informal sector, slums and instability
The current economic downturn makes employment
prospects for young urban dwellers all the more worrisome
as the issues related to their specific segment of the labour
market had never been addressed during previous, more
prosperous years. The upcoming generations continue to suffer
disproportionately from a scarcity of decent employment
opportunities. This scarcity is the primary cause of poverty and

social instability. In the developing world, the lack of decent,
sustainable jobs promotes a sense of displacement among
the young. This can lead to crime, under-development and a
cycle of poverty, potentially feeding political and ideological
unrest and inciting violence.16 The risk is especially significant
in those many countries where demographic patterns exhibit
so-called “youth bulges”, when young people comprise at
least 40 per cent of the population. The majority of criminal
offences around the world are committed by youth aged
between 12 and 25. Young people’s resentment of their own
limited opportunities and their place in society can also give
rise to public displays of frustration and violence: in 2005, the
French riots over employment conditions for school leavers
underscored the volatility of the up-and-coming generations
when they feel marginalized.
The persistence of the urban informal sector and the
expansion of urban slums point to the pressing need for welladapted employment policies.17 The 2009 UN-HABITAT
survey suggests that what is happening is quite the opposite,
though: in too many cities of the developing world, and
regardless of the specific target set by the Millennium
Development Goals, slum areas remain a “blind spot”
when it comes to policy interventions, job creation and
youth support. For many of the working poor, low incomes
in the face of rising land prices virtually rule them out of
access to land, in the process encouraging the persistence or
expansion of slums. In the absence of effective institutions
or policies, if any at all, cities are essentially being built
“back to front”,18 as land development takes place before the
formulation, enactment and implementation of planning
strategies and control mechanisms: the urban poor lead this
process whereby building comes first (admittedly, as a matter
of emergency), with servicing and regularizing only at some
later, undetermined stage.
Facing up to the global crisis: Youth employment in the
development agenda
Unemployment is the one option that many of the urban
poor cannot afford. They frequently have no savings and cannot
fall back on social security. A large proportion of workers in
developing economies have no alternative when economic
conditions deteriorate and the cost of living increases: they
must work even more, picking up any available job regardless
of terms and conditions. Such circumstances are not captured
in official statistics. Higher unemployment rates will continue
to reflect the current crisis, though only to a point; at the
same time, more and more people will be joining the ranks of
the insecure working poor in developing economies.
Youth employment features high on the development
agenda. The international community formally recognizes the
importance of providing opportunities for income generation
among young people: Millennium Development Goal 8,
target 16, calls on rich nations to enter into partnerships with
developing countries to devise and deploy strategies for decent
and productive work for youth. For the purposes of these

Box 2.4.1: The “Urban Advantage”
The “urban advantage” refers to the abundance
and variety of goods, services, amenities and opportunities which cities make available compared
with rural areas. Social connections – or “human
capital”– are also part of that. The urban advantage is a function of the density and scale of public, business, education, health, cultural and other
institutions a city manages to concentrate.

tion and transportation networks to employment
and social opportunities to pursuits of a political,
cultural or academic nature. In this sense, the
urban advantage includes the four dimensions
of inclusiveness – economic, social, political and
cultural – which coincide with the basic components of individual and collective development
and well-being.

Although the phrase “urban advantage” belongs
to urban economics, the notion refers to tangible
as well as intangible benefits, from water, sanita-

The urban advantage makes a city attractive to
both rich and poor, but it takes adequate policies
if it is to be broadly shared across the whole pop-

ulation. Rights-based policy approaches, such as
the “right to the city”, promote a more equitable
distribution of the urban advantage among residents of a given city. As advocated in this Report,
this type of approach looks to make effective the
whole range of universally recognized fundamental rights, prominent among which are equality
and non-discrimination. These rights largely overlap with the four dimensions of inclusiveness,
which ultimately provide the foundations of what
is known as civilization.

Box 2.4.2: Measuring “inequality of opportunity”
Monetary measures of inequality – income and
the consumption of various household goods and
services – reveal little about the specific deprivations people experience in different places,
and this recognition has prompted fresh thinking
about the best ways of capturing the complexity
of the forces behind inequality. Researchers are
now looking beyond the Gini coefficient to focus
on measures of unequal opportunity.
As developed recently by experts at the World
Bank and institutions in several Latin American
countries, the Human Opportunity Index (HOI)
measures the likelihood that children from different backgrounds, or in different combinations of
circumstances, will be able to access the basic
services they need. By synthesizing measures of
both the opportunities available to children, in the
form of the general provision of various services
in an area, and the equitable distribution of those
services, the opportunity index provides a holistic
picture of how level the playing field is for people
from different social backgrounds. This type of
measurement is of significant value to public authorities, as it points out precisely where policy
interventions could be most effective; more generally, the index has the merit of highlighting the

ways in which inequalities of opportunity affect
peoples’ life chances.
The HOI is a composite indicator that summarizes
provision and accessibility of basic opportunities
related to education and housing, based on measures such as timely completion of sixth grade,
school attendance at ages 10 to 14, and access
to clean water, sanitation and electricity. On top
of other composite measures of well-being – first
and foremost, the Human Development Index
(HDI), which synthesizes average literacy, life expectancy and income – the really novel element
the HOI introduces is a focus on potential opportunities. Together with government policies,
labour markets, and myriad other factors such as
trade union affiliation and political participation,
these potential opportunities determine measurable effects, such as income and the way it
is distributed. Ability to anticipate potential opportunities places researchers and policymakers
alike in a better position to understand the forces
at work that hinder the chances for some social
groups to fulfil their potential.
In the first practical application of the Human Opportunity Index in 2005, researchers calculated
the values based on household survey data for 19

countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. As
noted earlier in this report, inequalities are more
pronounced and pervasive in that region than
anywhere else in the world. The results identified
widespread differences across countries, both in
terms of education and housing and in relation to
the overall composite index summarizing all five
variables. As shown in the table below, several
countries, including Chile, Jamaica, Argentina
and Mexico, were found to provide broad-based
access to education opportunities, while others,
such as Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras,
were in need of substantial improvement. In
terms of housing conditions, Costa Rica, Chile,
Argentina and Venezuela were at the forefront,
with Nicaragua, Honduras and Bolivia lagging behind. The overall composite index showed that
in 2005, Chile was where equality of opportunity
was at its best in the sample. This is hardly surprising, given the country’s sustained efforts to
target public services, including housing, to the
poor and other vulnerable groups.
Unequal access to opportunities cannot be justified from a moral or ethical standpoint, but the
fact remains that the bundle of opportunities
available to any individual begins taking shape
even before they are born. Whether a child will
have access to clean water, education, medical
care, let alone to life in the first place, is largely
determined by circumstances that are beyond
their control. A combination of race and ethnicity,
the incomes and education of a child’s parents,
and the child’s place of birth – whether a rural or
an urban area, a slum or a wealthier neighbourhood – will largely determine not just the child’s
probability of surviving their first year, but also
their future prospects. Given the rather deterministic nature of birth circumstances, it is hardly
surprising that measurable outcomes, such as
poverty, persist across generations for identifiable sub-sets of the population, insofar as they
are rooted in racial or other types of discrimination, or in inequitable access to basic opportunities such as health and education.
However, family circumstances are only one part
of the equation; exclusionary political systems
(such as colonialism and apartheid) have also
been shown severely to hamper equality of opportunity, even after these regimes were dismantled and after several years under less repressive
governments. Many researchers have suggested
that inequality persists in these countries because
colonial or racist regimes handed power over to
local elites who only extended the exclusionary
systems and policies of their former oppressors.

skills and improve access to both productive resources and
market opportunities.
Jobs through state-built infrastructure for all
On top of the policy recommendations above, another
broad type of initiative can generate both decent jobs and
socially inclusive growth that benefits the vulnerable and the
working poor. It is for individual governments to explore these
avenues and build them into economic stimulus policies. The
suggestion is to generate more formal employment through
rehabilitation and construction of physical infrastructure,
such as roads, bridges, schools and hospitals, including
upgraded social care and community centres. Given the
current scarcity of financial capital, these schemes should best
be labour-based. Labour-intensive approaches have become
an important element of job creation strategies in many lowwage developing countries, in the process taking advantage of
substantial reserves of underused labour, and they are relevant
in developed countries as well. While it takes time for major
capital-intensive new infrastructure projects to result in
additional employment, labour-based approaches can generate
jobs and much-needed infrastructure in shorter timeframes.
Such massive mobilization of available local workforces
could provide low-income and slum-dwelling women, young
and other vulnerable people with a wide range of amenities
and services, including clean and safe community centres,
support for early childhood development programmes
and eldercare, new uses of public spaces for cultural and
educational programmes, repair of rural road networks, or
irrigation networks, among others.
In the medium term, these labour-intensive programmes
are to be combined with vocational training and skill development activities. After eluding them for so long, the “urban
advantage” would finally become a tangible reality for many
marginalized urban dwellers, and through their own efforts.

The Opportunity Divide – When the “Urban Advantage” eludes the poor

partnerships, as for any other efforts to generate dignified and
legitimate employment opportunities, two factors militate in
favour of targeting urban youth living in poverty, as suggested
by the recent UN-HABITAT survey data: (1) young people in
slums are more likely to work in the informal sector than their
non-slum peers, and (2) informal sector jobs provide little
financial security, or chances to access well-paid employment
in the future.
If youth employment is to be addressed in any effective
way, four elements must be taken into consideration: young
people’s employability, equal opportunities for jobs, entrepreneurship opportunities, and employment creation strategies.
Employability is an outgrowth of education and economic
development; any efforts to promote equity should investigate whether young women and men benefit from the same
opportunities; efforts to encourage youth-run enterprises can
ensure that young people develop skills for the benefit of local communities. It is for public policies to pave the way for
new employment opportunities for youth. Beyond enhanced
skills, public and private sector partners must keep job creation as a central concern of their capital investment strategies.
It is also high time to promote local economic development
based on a participatory process that encourages partnerships
between the main private and public stakeholders, as part
of joint pro-poor and pro-employment urban development
strategies; these should make use of local resources and competitive advantage in a global set-up, with the final objective
of creating decent jobs and stimulating economic activity.19
Efforts to share the “urban advantage” more equitably with
young job-seekers should go hand in hand with support for
the informal sector, where most of the urban poor work in
low-paid, low-productivity and low-security jobs. Local
authorities should adjust laws and regulations to lower the
costs and increase the benefits for those willing to formalize
their businesses. Local authorities should also provide
assistance to small enterprises, enabling them to upgrade

Quick Facts	
	Hunger in Cities
1.	 Hunger is endemic in many poor urban areas
of the developing world and the food crisis can
only compound the situation.
2.	 The food crisis is often not one of supply, but

The Health Divide

1.	 In urban slums, shelter deprivations and
environmental risks combine to hinder
people’s ability to escape hunger, and
exposure to infectious illnesses creates a
vicious cycle where children are constantly
malnourished.
2.	 Indoor air pollution is a “quiet” and overlooked
killer, and lack of global awareness is one
of the primary obstacles to the widespread
implementation of existing, proven responses.
	Education: Opportunities and Inequalities
1.	 The education system perpetuates and
reproduces social inequalities.
2.	 In the poor areas of many African cities,
primary school enrolment is decreasing.
3.	 Efforts to improve the education of girls in
some countries have resulted in significant
increases and progress in female enrolment
and narrowing the gender gap, but male
enrolment is regressing in some cities in
various regions.

Invalidated hopes

T

he economic divide does more than deprive the
poor of the land tenure, proper shelter, basic
utilities and dignified employment that are
typically associated with the “urban advantage”
and to which they are entitled. Beyond the functional goods
and services that provide for decent living conditions, the
repercussions of poverty can reach into life in its most
physical and social dimensions. In urban areas, the endemic
hunger and malnutrition caused by inequitable distribution
of largely available food resources are so debilitating for the
poor as to invalidate hopes for improved opportunities in
the future. Inequitable distribution of basic services across
urban areas has the same debilitating physical effect on lowincome households, who are exposed to more health hazards
than the better-off that can afford water, sanitation and waste
disposal services.
Hunger and poor health feed on each other. Their
physical repercussions are ingrained from infancy onwards,
affecting the development and opportunities of the younger
generations. Disease adds to economic pressures on the
poor, and so do the costs of children’s schooling – although
education is known for improving general health and reducing
poverty. This is how the physical and intellectual potential
of millions of young urban dwellers is impaired, dilapidated
or denied for lack of equitable distributive policies. This
unfair dispensation is frequently more detrimental to girls,
although they are the privileged vectors of healthy bodies and
minds from one generation to another. The ongoing global
economic crisis can only compound the hard choices urban
poor families are left facing nowadays–food to survive the day,
but no health care to survive tomorrow, and no school to pave
the way for the future.

Policy Points	
	Hunger in Cities
1.	 The structural food crises the urban poor
experience on an ongoing basis call for
fundamental policy remedies, including
production, marketing, distribution, handling
and control of food for the urban market.
2.	 The food crisis will be long-term and the worst
is yet to come for the most vulnerable unless
extraordinary measures are taken to help them.
	

The Health Divide

1.	 The fight against childhood ill-health must take
in the modern environment of disease, namely,
the local neighbourhood and the city as a
whole.
2.	 Policymakers can help alleviate health
inequalities in poor urban areas with
comprehensive primary care and better access
to healthy food.
3.	 Slum upgrading and the sustainability of health
and nutrition programmes are linked and they
should be part of integrated slum upgrading
initiatives.
	Education: Opportunities and Inequalities
1.	 If school enrolment and achievement are to be
improved in underprivileged urban areas, a
combination of incentives that stimulates both
demand and supply is required.
2.	 Improvements in girls’ enrolment have resulted
from various interrelated strategies that may
provide some insights into ways of keeping
boys in school.
3.	 Most national and international literacy and
education programmes so far have focused
on reducing the urban/rural gap in education,
overlooking the divide between rich and poor
prevailing in urban areas.

The Social Divide – Impact on Bodies and Minds

Hunger has, for a long time, been considered a rural
phenomenon, mostly related to the availability of produce
depending on weather and other factors. The assumption that
food security is much more tenuous for rural agriculturalists
than city residents has been based primarily on the persistence
of a rural/urban dichotomy, which holds that residents of one
area live fundamentally different lives from those in the other.
Many country reports and publications from international
agencies indeed show higher rates of malnutrition in rural than
in urban areas; however, various studies show that hunger can
be found in urban areas, too. The relatively low prevalence of
malnutrition in urban areas, as measured by the incidence of
underweight children, conceals significant differences in food
security across socioeconomic groups; this low prevalence also
conceals the fact that poverty can have remarkably similar
practical effects in urban and in rural areas.
In market economies, cities are characterized by “relative
inequality”, where poverty is not absolute but rather is
measured by the gaps in opportunities and resources between
the poor and the rich living in a segmented environment.
In urban areas, disposable income and food prices largely
determine the amounts and types of foods consumed by
poor urban families, whereas in rural areas it is largely left to
cropping patterns and the timing and quality of the harvest
to determine food availability for subsistence farmers. The
relative differences in income and wealth are much less stark
among rural than urban residents. In urban areas, the higher
purchasing power of the rich contributes to inflation of food
and health care costs, making these unaffordable for the poor.
For the urban poor, hunger originates with the sheer lack of
money to purchase food that is adequate both in quantity
and quality.1 Even when a country produces enough food to
sustain its whole population, hunger may remain a persistent
problem among poor urban populations if the available food
commands prices that they cannot afford. In urban areas,
hunger, just as poverty, is only the outcome of an inequitable
distribution of available resources.
Unequal access to food and other basic needs exposes
poor populations to a host of diseases. The data presented
here shows that hunger is endemic among both the urban
poor and rural populations of many countries in Africa, Asia
and Latin America and the Caribbean.2 Ultimately, poverty
afflicts populations in both urban and rural environments
with ill health and limited life chances. However, those living
in urban slums and squatter settlements frequently have to
endure worse conditions than their rural relatives, with the
children in the poorest urban income bracket experiencing
malnutrition at more than twice the rate of those in the
richest income category.3

Lessons from countries in continuous and structural
food crisis

102

For many developing countries, the current food crisis
is not unprecedented. In many places food insecurity has
affected the daily lives of urban poor and rural families for
at least the past two decades, with hunger and both chronic
and acute malnutrition remaining matters of serious concern.
Children are often born into hunger, grow up in hunger and
die in hunger. Malnutrition starts during pregnancy, when
women suffering from anaemia and other complications do
not receive proper antenatal care. In urban areas, children
from deprived households are often severely malnourished, at
times to the point where immune systems are suppressed and
the risk of disease is high.
As part of its Monitoring Urban Inequities Programme
(MUIP), UN-HABITAT has made a fresh review of
Demographic and Health Survey data collected between
1990 and 2007 in various countries in Africa, Asia and Latin
America and the Caribbean. Analysis reveals that serious
malnutrition has been widespread in these regions’ urban
slums and rural areas since 1990, regardless of the local food
crisis situation.4 The data highlights serious malnutrition in
the African countries of Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, Central
African Republic, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, where more than
four out of 10 children suffered from stunted development
resulting from malnutrition throughout the survey years. For
instance, Niger featured high proportions of children with
stunted development in both poor urban and rural areas for
the years 1992, 1998 and 2006. In Asia, these proportions
were the highest in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, with more
than four out of 10 children in Bangladesh malnourished in
survey years 1996, 1999 and 2004. In India, similarly high
proportions of malnourished children were observed in 1992,
1998 and 2005. In Latin America and the Caribbean, high
rates of malnutrition were observed in Bolivia, Guatemala
and Haiti, where stunted development affected three to
five out of 10 children. The two Demographic and Health
Surveys conducted in Guatemala in 1995 and 1998 show
high, though decreasing, proportions of children with stunted
development among the urban poor, at 61 per cent in 1995
and 49 per cent in 1998.
The data also shows that malnutrition in most poor urban
and rural areas has remained serious over time, sometimes more
than 20 times the 2.3 per cent rate expected in healthy, wellnourished children. These extremely high rates have occurred
against a background of adverse longer-term trends and
structural vulnerability associated with the living conditions
in both slums and rural areas. This is why, for instance, several
authors have suggested that the 2005 food crisis in Niger
has been misinterpreted as a unique phenomenon resulting
from a large shock, although the situation was exacerbated by
relatively moderate production and price shocks.5

Poverty and hunger coexist across human settlement types
As mentioned earlier, children in the poorest income brackets are malnourished at twice the rate of their counterparts in
the richest ones. Even in many countries with serious malnutrition, children from rich families are much less affected
than those from lower-income households. Data from 2005
in Niger shows that while stunted development affected four
or five out of 10 children from both poor urban and rural
areas, the proportion in non-slum urban areas was only about
one out of four (or 26 per cent). The highest differential in
malnutrition rates was observed in Ethiopia in 2005, where
only 11 per cent of children in non-slum urban areas were
malnourished, or some four times fewer than their counterparts in both urban slum areas and rural settlements (48 per
cent). Similar patterns were observed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2007, with 41 per cent of children from
poor urban areas malnourished compared with 16 per cent
in non-slum urban areas. In Bolivia, while high proportions
of malnutrition have been observed in rural and poor urban
areas (37 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively), in non-slum
urban areas fewer than 15 per cent of children experienced
chronic malnutrition. In India and Bangladesh, the incidence
of malnutrition in poor urban areas is more than twice that
in non-slum urban areas: for India, the figures are 54 per cent
and 21 per cent, respectively, and for Bangladesh, 51.4 per
cent and 24 per cent.

Rising food prices worldwide are intensifying the crisis
The prices of many basic foods have increased over the
past two years, leading to a major crisis that affects millions
of poor people throughout the world. The price increases
have involved virtually all major commodities. International
Monetary Fund statistics show that prices of imported rice and
local cereals have increased by 230 to 350 per cent since early
2008.9 Prices of dairy products and many cereals more than
doubled in 2007 and continued to climb throughout 2009.
This rapid price increase has worsened already dire conditions
for the urban poor and rural populations.10 Before the current
global food crisis, many countries experienced food supply
changes that reflected their own specific vulnerabilities. For
example in 2005, Niger underwent a food crisis as a result of
severe droughts. Bangladesh also experienced a food crisis in
the same year. In both countries, the poorest people suffered
the most – those who before the crisis were already spending
far higher proportions of their incomes on food than those
better-off, and found it increasingly difficult to afford basic
rations. For them, the food crisis meant smaller portions,
fewer meals and foods with lower nutritional value, with
the immediate effect of increasing rates of malnutrition. In
Madhya Pradesh, India, where ongoing food crises have been
compounded by a four-year drought, the rise in world food
prices has stretched many families beyond breaking point.11
Rising food prices impact consumers in both rich and poor
countries, where even the urban middle classes can be affected;
this is particularly the case in developing countries.12 During a
severe food crisis, hunger spreads to almost all socioeconomic
groups in a given place. In Zimbabwe, for example, where the
ongoing food crisis has its own internal causes, food shortages
and rising costs have affected all social segments, even the
rich. For the first time, malnutrition became serious among
the richest urban residents, affecting 25 per cent of that
population, compared with 29 per cent among the poorest
urban residents – a difference of only four percentage points.

The Social Divide – Impact on Bodies and Minds

Several factors account for nutritional deprivation among
slum dwellers, including extreme poverty, discrimination and
geographic isolation. The multiple poverty-related factors
leading to malnutrition include low incomes that limit access
to food in terms of quantity, quality or both. Lack of access
to land restricts access to credit and other resources, with
repercussions on income.6 The replacement of traditional
crops with more profitable cash crops also tends to compound
nutritional vulnerability among the urban poor, reducing the
availability of staple foods and further inflating prices. Food
purchases among the urban poor are heavily dependent on
competing demands for unavoidable non-food expenditures,
such as commuting to work, housing and remittances to
relatives in the countryside. With limited transport options,
the urban poor seldom have easy access to central markets,
and therefore are compelled to buy food in small quantities
from local shops at higher prices.7 A recent survey conducted
in Bangladesh in 2009 by the World Food Programme and
UNICEF found that one in four households in Bangladesh
is food-insecure, and 58 per cent of the households had had
insufficient food during the previous 12 months.8 The same
survey showed that real household income in the country
dropped by 12 per cent between 2005 and 2008. At the end
of 2008, food expenditure represented 62 per cent of total
household expenditures, or 10 percentage points more than
the national average in 2005.

Hunger is not only an outcome of food deficiency – it is also
an indication of the conditions in which families live. Besides
food deficiency, malnutrition is influenced by living conditions
that increase exposure to disease; this is the case with the
overcrowding, inadequate housing and poor access to water and sanitation that are typical of slums. At the community level, lack of waste management and waste water treatment systems increases children’s likelihood of contracting
diseases such as diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and
malaria. Available information shows that approximately half
of all nutritional problems occur in areas that are exposed to
environmental risks. Exposure to infectious illnesses, mainly
parasite-borne, creates a vicious cycle where children are
constantly malnourished as a consequence of unhealthy living
conditions.17

104

Data from Benin shows that where shelter deprivation is severe, child malnutrition is twice as prevalent as in areas with
safe water, adequate sanitation and decent housing conditions.
For slum households that lack access to improved water and
sanitation, the prevalence of child malnutrition is often higher
even than in rural areas. This is the case in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, where 46 per cent of children living in nondurable urban housing are malnourished, compared with 16
per cent in rural areas. In Cameroon in 2004, the proportions
were 50 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. Similarly, in India, 45 per cent of children from households without adequate
sanitation are malnourished, according to recent Demographic
and Health Survey data. Even in Jordan, where proportions of
malnourished children are low overall, 2007 data show that 36
per cent of children without access to adequate sanitation in
urban areas were malnourished, compared with 12 per cent
among those in non-slum areas and 26 per cent among those
in rural areas. High rates of malnutrition – as measured by the
incidence of childhood diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria and
acute respiratory infections – are clearly associated with lack
of access to basic shelter amenities.

Many countries have enough food for all of the population,
but only the richest can have access, while the poorest struggle
every day to secure one meal for their children. In places
where child malnutrition rates are high among the poorest,
the crisis is often not one of food supply, but rather of access
– access not only to food of sufficient quality and quantity
for the household, but also access to income with which to
buy or barter for food while on top of this paying for basic
public health services, education and other needed goods
and services. This situation represents a “silent emergency”,
characterized by persistent high degrees of acute malnutrition
in “non-emergency” times.13 In Latin America and the
Caribbean, for example, the greatest threat to food security
is social inequality, since the region is the most unequal in
the world.14 High food prices have added another layer of
instability for the poorest urban and rural residents in the
region, who already found that affording the basic essentials
for survival was a challenge. In these areas, it takes improved
food distribution networks, better health facilities and access
to improved drinking water to improve child nutrition.
During famines and droughts, rural populations can rely on
domestic stores while those in urban slums often experience
starvation, unable as they are to afford inflated food prices.
Poor urban families often have to use up to 70 per cent of
their income to purchase any food that is available, forcing
them to reduce spending on education, childcare and other
costs. In the most deeply affected countries, families eat
fewer meals, sometimes even not eating for whole days, and
children stop going to school as parents save on fees to pay for
food.15 Under such circumstances, poor households become
poorer, suffering a significant loss in household well-being.
The doubling of global food prices over the last three years
could potentially push 100 million people in low-income
countries deeper into poverty.16
After the food crisis: What is next for the urban poor?
To date, no adequate systematic effort has been made
to alleviate hunger in poor urban areas. The focus tends to
remain on rural areas, where prevailing responses are not
relevant in urban settings, since supply-related malnutrition
in cities is largely a consequence of household dependence
on food prices and cash income. Since urban dwellers do
not cope with vulnerability and risk in the same way as rural
populations, unique policy responses are required to address
their needs. Experts predict that the food crisis will be longterm, and that the worst is yet to come unless extraordinary
measures are taken to help the most vulnerable. In hungerstruck developing countries, people have been consuming
food stocks and selling off assets to purchase food, but they
will not be able to do so indefinitely.18 As recent Demographic
and Health Survey data on child malnutrition reveals, hunger
is endemic in many poor urban areas. The urban poor were
living with hunger before the crisis, are still living with hunger

Stabilization or decline in food prices have occurred in several countries, but the outlook for
some African countries remains bleak: they have

In neighbouring Burundi, the urban areas of Bujumbura, Gitenga and Ngozi saw a 20 per cent
increase in local food prices between 2007 and
2008. The situation was exacerbated by the ongoing conflict that has hindered agricultural production in recent years. In the same period, wheat
prices doubled in Senegal and quadrupled in Somalia. Zimbabwe’s highly inflationary environment
has reduced purchasing power, making nearly half
the population food-insecure. In Zimbabwe as in
other African countries, urban communities resort
to a variety of coping strategies, including reduced
frequency and contents of meals, which could
lead to rising malnutrition.

The Social Divide – Impact on Bodies and Minds

Agencies monitoring food security in Kenya, for
instance, have recorded deepening urban food
insecurity caused by rising prices and further compounded by conflict, floods and drought. In March
2009, an estimated 4.1 million urban poor in the
country were classified as “highly food-insecure”.
High prices caused slum-dwelling households to
reduce food consumption; as many as 7.6 million
slum-dwellers countrywide found themselves unable to meet daily food needs, with maize prices
soaring by more than 130 per cent in the capital,
Nairobi, and by 85 per cent in the coastal town
of Mombasa, in 2008. The cost of non-food items
also increased, leading to reduced overall household consumption. Prices of cooking fuels, particularly kerosene, rose by 30 to 50 per cent, and the
cost of water more than doubled.

The surge in food prices since the end of 2006
has led to increasing hunger in the world’s poorest countries and made urban food security more
precarious. The Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) estimated the number of hungry people at
923 million in 2007, a more than 80 million rise
since 1992. The most rapid increases in chronic
hunger occurred between 2003 and 2005, and in
2007 when high food prices drove millions of people into food insecurity. Chronic hunger and malnutrition became more prevalent among the urban
poor, who had to spend more to purchase not just
food but other household necessities as well.

Hunger alleviation goes beyond food availability
Eradicating hunger will require multiple interventions, and
not only those related to food availability. Nutrition and good
health depend on access to health care as well as adequate
food, particularly for children. Use of safe water, improved
sanitation and durable housing materials, together with
provision of sufficient living areas to ease overcrowding, will
improve the chances of better health and life conditions for
slum dwellers and rural residents, with or without increases
in food availability. This goes to show that slum upgrading
and the sustainability of health and nutrition programmes are
linked and should, together, become part of a comprehensive
approach to improving the lives of the urban poor.22
More comprehensive provision of health services, including
immunization campaigns, would also improve nutrition among
the urban poor through prevention of gastrointestinal and infectious diseases. Along with primary health care, direct nutrition
programmes are urgently needed, including food fortification
and mass distribution of capsules and tablets to eliminate deficiencies of iodine, iron, folic acid and vitamin A. Adequate diet
among pregnant and lactating women, together with community education in proper infant and child feeding, can
also improve children’s nutritional well being.23

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

and will continue to live with hunger after the global food
crisis ends. Indeed, they experience structural food crises
on an ongoing basis. Consequently, it will take structural
measures to tackle hunger among the urban poor.
Long-term solutions will depend on a variety of factors, such
as provision of jobs and services and reduction of poverty and
inequalities, which could take generations to achieve in many
low-income countries. Policymakers can build on currently
available knowledge and resources in order dramatically to
reduce hunger among the urban poor, particularly in the
production, marketing, distribution, handling and control of
food for the urban market.19 For example, in Sri Lanka in the
1970s, a successful food delivery system known as “fair price”
(or “ration”) shops distributed staples at subsidized prices in
low-income urban areas. While many international agencies
advise against the general use of food subsidies, research
shows that it is possible to design targeted interventions for
particular commodities or types of “ration” shops.20 Local
authorities must also pay attention to the potential of urban
agriculture. Even in crowded areas, people can often find
space to grow vegetables or raise animals to supplement their
food purchases.21

The health divide
In order to understand public health needs in urban
areas, one must look beyond poverty rates and crude rates
of morbidity or mortality, and focus on disparities in living
conditions. Although poverty alleviation is often considered
the most important step toward improving general health,
in urban areas marginal increases in income for the poor do
not ensure access to decent accommodation, safe water or
adequate sanitation. The poor are typically driven to the least
developed areas of a city, where dilapidated environments lead
to worse health outcomes and greater risks of premature death
than in improved, well-maintained areas. Child mortality rates
remain highly associated with diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and
acute respiratory infections related to overcrowding and air
pollution, which in turn result from various environmental
health hazards such as lack of sanitation and hygiene, lack
of access to safe water, poor housing conditions, poor
management of solid wastes, and many other hazardous
conditions. Children in substandard environments are
exposed to contaminated air, food, water, soil and conditions
where parasite-carrying insects breed. Environmental equity
is a more powerful determinant of health and mortality than
the overall wealth of nations.24
Adequate shelter protects against exposure to
environmental diseases

Cameroon, children from households without improved
water, improved sanitation and sufficient living area feature
a much greater prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases – 33.3 per
cent – than those living in non-slum urban households (9 per
cent). In Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the mere
lack of improved sanitation is enough for a child to be highly
exposed to diarrhoeal diseases (18.3 per cent, compared with
13.9 per cent among children of households with all four
basic shelter services). In DRC, when combined with lack of
sanitation, lack of improved water causes the prevalence of
diarrhoea to rise to 23.9 per cent.
Improving the quantity and quality of water available for
domestic use can significantly reduce illness and death from
diarrhoeal and waterborne illnesses. However, in some cases
the source of water is safe, but contamination occurs through
polluted containers or other environmental conditions before
the water reaches the household for consumption. In many
cities of the developing world, water supplies are undrinkable,
contaminated as they are by bacteria, untreated or poorly
treated sewage, heavy metals or silt from soil erosion, fertilizers
and pesticides, mining tailings and industrial waste. According
to 2007 data from Jordan, the sole lack of improved water is
enough by itself to double (to 32.3 per cent, compared with
16 per cent) the risk of diarrhoeal diseases for children by
comparison with the entire urban area. Even in Jordan’s rural
areas, only 16 per cent of children were affected by diarrhoeal
diseases in 2007.
Better housing conditions are also essential to ensuring a
healthy population. High-density accommodation in slums
and squatter settlements, or poor-quality housing in general,
intensifies the risk of disease transmission. Overcrowding
increases exposure to droplet-spread infections, as poor
ventilation inhibits the dispersion of contaminated air and
lack of sunshine prevents natural air sterilization by sunlight.

The Social Divide – Impact on Bodies and Minds

Poor sanitation, combined with unsafe water supply and
lack of hygiene, claims the lives of many slum dwellers every
year. Sanitation is the primary factor that protects water,
air, soil and food from contamination, and thereby reduces
the risk of disease.25 When sanitation is combined with
positive hygiene – hand washing with soap or other cleansing
agents, and safe storage of water – its effectiveness is greatest,
creating a safe environment and enhancing the health of
the population. However, in densely populated urban areas,
access to latrines does not significantly reduce the risk of
faecal-oral diseases because the facilities may not be cleaned
and maintained regularly. Indeed, short of sound hygiene
practices, latrines alone have no positive influence on health.
Recent data from Pakistan, for instance, indicates very little
difference in the frequency of diarrhoeal episodes between
households with latrines and those without.26 Furthermore,
in 2006, the prevalence of diarrhoea among children in
Pakistan was 21.2 per cent for those living in non-slum urban
households, compared with 23 per cent for those living in
slum households. The only significant difference in the
prevalence of diarrhoea among urban children emerges when
severe shelter deprivations are present: in households lacking
all four basic shelter services, the prevalence is 38 per cent.
Similarly, there are differences between children of the poorest
and the richest urban families, among whom the prevalence
of diarrhoea is 26 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively.27
The link between sanitation and diarrhoeal diseases is not
uniform across regions, countries or cities. For instance, in

In an overcrowded slum area, pit latrines expose more children
to diarrhoeal diseases compared with a non-overcrowded
rural area.28 In slums, where many households often share a
single toilet between them, even the use of improved latrines
is unsafe and exposes children to diarrhoeal diseases. The
number of latrines may not be adequate, leading to unsanitary
conditions that increase exposure to contaminated faecal
matter and then to diarrhoea. The concentration of people
living in small, poorly ventilated areas increases the risk of
disease transmission and multiple infections.29 In Nepal, lack
of sanitation in overcrowded urban areas exposes children to
diarrhoeal diseases at a higher rate (17.9 per cent) than in the
country’s rural areas (12.6 per cent) or its urban environments
overall (10.3 per cent). Where all four basic shelter services
are lacking, the prevalence of diarrhoea rises to 20.8 per
cent. In India as well, children from households without
improved water and sanitation in poor housing conditions
are exposed to a high prevalence of diarrhoea (16.7 per cent);
in Namibia and Niger, lack of sanitation and durable housing
are also responsible for high rates of diarrhoeal diseases among
children, with a prevalence of 17.6 per cent in Namibia and
29.9 per cent in Niger, compared with 11.6 per cent and
16.7 per cent, respectively, among children from non-slum
households.

Poor solid waste management causes
environmental diseases

Improperly managed solid waste can clog storm drains,
cause flooding, result in garbage heaps and provide breeding and feeding grounds for mosquitoes, flies and rodents.
The combination of environmental hazards surrounding solid
waste can lead to injuries and easy transmission of bacterial
diseases and parasitic infections. Occasional flooding and
the presence of pools of standing water can lead to increased
incidence of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases, especially during rainy seasons, placing workers and local residents at risk. Public facilities often fall into disrepair for lack
of maintenance, setting the stage for accidents and poor waste
management. Living in a poor environment can also make
it harder to access other shelter services. Any positive effects
of improved sanitation facilities can be diluted and offset by
ineffective management, collection, treatment and disposal of
human excreta, household waste water, storm water, sewage
effluents, industrial and other hazardous waste products.
In most African cities, households typically have no
safe ways to dispose of solid waste. In Benin, for example,
fewer than 50 per cent of urban households benefit from
collection of household wastes by public or private systems;
this proportion is particularly low in smaller cities (17 per
cent, compared with 47 per cent in large cities). Associated
health problems include high incidences of cholera, diarrhoea
and dysentery, especially in children who tend to play where
waste accumulates. Again, in Benin, recent data shows that
the prevalence of diarrhoea among children under 5 years old
is 18.5 per cent in those urban households dumping waste in

the yard, compared with 7 per cent where waste is collected
and taken away. In Kenya in 2003, one out of four children
living in households where solid waste is dumped in the yard
had diarrhoea, compared to fewer than one out of 10 living
in households with regular garbage collection. In addition
to lack of solid waste collection, it is recognized that lack
of drainage, especially in areas of communal water supply,
breeds mosquitoes and flies, which can be a nuisance and
spread disease. Water lines flow next to storm drains, which
frequently turn into open sewers.
Poor management of waste and waste water can also
increase the spread of disease in many ways. Mosquito-related
diseases, especially malaria and dengue fever, can be spread
from breeding areas in standing water that collects in potholes,
disposed-of construction materials and holes dug for sand and
gravel. Demographic and Health Surveys in African urban
areas show that the prevalence of fever remains high in many
cities. In Benin in 2001, for example, more than two out of five
children living in households where waste was not collected
had fever. In contrast, only one out of four children living
in households with regular collection had fever, according
to the same survey. Lack of collection of household waste is
also associated with the spread of respiratory infections. In
Benin, the prevalence of acute respiratory infections is 17.1
per cent among children living in households where waste
is dumped in the yard, compared with 13.6 per cent among
children living in households with regular waste collection.
In Ethiopia, the prevalence of acute respiratory infections is
six times higher among children living in households where
the waste is dumped in a nearby river than among children
living in households with regular waste collection (18 per
cent, compared with 3 per cent).
Indoor air pollution and acute respiratory infections
It is estimated that indoor air pollution is responsible for
some three million deaths every year.30 Women who cook
in enclosed quarters using biomass fuels and coal are at risk
of chronic bronchitis and acute respiratory infections, as are
their children, who are often exposed to significant indoor air
pollution alongside their mothers on a daily basis.31 Indoor
air pollution is a “quiet” and overlooked killer, and lack of
awareness is one of the primary obstacles to the widespread
implementation of existing, proven responses.32
A majority of households in many sub-Saharan African cities are still primarily dependent on biomass fuels for cooking.
For example, in Benin, 86 per cent of urban families use wood
or charcoal for cooking, and the prevalence remains high even
in non-slum areas (74 per cent). Wood and charcoal are predominant in the cities of 10 African countries reviewed in
UN-HABITAT’s analysis of Demographic and Health Survey
data (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mali, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia). In these cities, the
prevalence of acute respiratory infections among children under 5 is highest in households using wood, charcoal or dung.
When burned, these solid fuels produce significant amounts

of pollutants, including suspended particulate matter and
noxious gases, particularly in the absence of improved stoves
or adequate ventilation.33 In Burkina Faso, the prevalence of
acute respiratory infections among urban children under 5
is almost two times higher in households cooking with solid
fuels than in those using cleaner-burning liquid or gas fuels
(9.2 per cent, compared with 5.1 per cent). Kigali, Rwanda,
displays higher variations, with a 6 per cent prevalence of acute
respiratory infections among children living in households
cooking with non-solid fuels, compared with 15.6 per cent
among those using solid fuels. The use of dung for fuel is rare
in most African cities today, but as indicated in many studies,
when burned, dung produces more pollutants than any other
solid fuel. In the urban areas of Congo, the prevalence of acute
respiratory infections is twice as high in households cooking
with dung than in those using wood or charcoal (16.8 per cent
vs. 8.8 per cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively). The urban areas
of Ethiopia display the largest variation, with an acute respiratory infection prevalence of 28.7 per cent among households
cooking with dung, compared with 8.3 per cent among those
using charcoal and 4.8 per cent among those using kerosene.

The modern environment of disease

110

Against a global background of urbanization and continuing
industrialization, modern environmental health hazards have
become major contributors to the environmental diseases
affecting the African conti­nent.34 The major such hazards
include water pollution from environmental degradation
and industrial operations, urban air pollution from motor
vehicles, radiation hazards, climate change, and emerging
or re-emerging infectious diseases. Industrial pollution, in
particular, is becoming highly concentrated in expanding
urban areas, and as a result pollution intensity in Africa is
among the high­est in the world.35 Such environmental health
hazards affect many urban residents even in countries that
have made significant progress in the provision of access to
services, including improved water and sanitation, as well
as durable housing with sufficient living area. In Dakar, for
instance, and despite reduced numbers of slum-dwellers, the
prevalence of diarrhoea among children remains high, even
compared with rural areas: 28.1 per cent in the Senegalese
capital, vs. 16.7 per cent in smaller cities and 22.4 per cent in
rural areas. In Dakar, access to improved water and sanitation,
durable housing, waste collection and sufficient living areas
has been extended to many households, but even among these
the prevalence of diarrhoea remains dramatically high (27.1
per cent, compared with 32.2 per cent in non-slum areas). It is
clear that the fight against childhood diseases must transcend
the traditional realm of the household, in order to encompass
the modern environment of disease: the neighbourhood, and
the city as a whole, with all the attendant risks and harms.
Environmental risks to children’s health become particularly
acute after the first few months of life, and again when they
enter toddlerhood and begin to move around inside and
outside the home. There is little difference between neonatal
mortality rates in slum and non-slum urban areas; only after
the first few months of life, when they start receiving external
food and liquids, do more children die in slum than in nonslum areas. This can only further highlight the importance
of proper homes and diets as children grow. For example in
Egypt, antenatal and delivery health care is quasi-universal,
resulting in relatively low neonatal mortality. However, a
clear divide emerges early on in post-neonatal mortality,
with deaths of children aged between one and 12 months
two times higher in slums than in non-slum areas (27 deaths
per thousand, compared with 13 per thousand). A similar
order of magnitude has been recorded in Morocco: the postneonatal mortality rate is 15 per thousand in slum areas,
compared with 8 per thousand in non-slum areas, although
in both types of settlements the neonatal mortality rate is
an identical 24 per thousand. In urban Benin, the situation
is alarming as the post-neonatal mortality rate is 46 deaths
per thousand in slums, or three times higher than in nonslum urban areas (14 deaths per thousand), although, again,
neonatal mortality rates are an identical 24 per thousand. This
demonstrates that antenatal health care clearly benefits babies
more in the immediate period after birth than after the first
month of their lives, when different outcomes reflect different
social conditions.36

Cities provide better access to health services
In most countries, children born to the richest families have
a high probability of access to health care, including antenatal
and delivery, as well as immunization. Even in countries like
Niger, where the overall proportion of children without any
immunization is as high as 40 per cent, the majority of the
better-off children are immunized, or slightly more than twice
as many of the poorest children. Although access to health care
and delivery is skewed in favour of the rich in Niger, all children in urban areas are still better off on this count than those
in rural areas. The same is true in Malawi, where more than
80 per cent of children living in slums have been immunized
against measles. In Malawi as in most countries, this particular type of immunization is widespread in cities, both in nonslum and slum areas. The effect of urbanization on access to
health care services is undeniably positive; still, in some countries like Niger, Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Haiti, childhood
diseases such as measles remain among the five main causes
of child death in slum and rural areas where immunization
is not widespread. In those countries, it will take substantial
resources to curb the number of deaths related to measles and
other diseases such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria.

Improving urban living environments with thorough
policymaking
Poor living environments clearly add to the health
challenges slum dwellers keep facing. Inadequate sanitation,
hygiene and water lead not only to more sickness and
deaths, but also to higher health care costs, lower school
enrolment and retention rates, and lower labour productivity
among slum dwellers than their non-slum counterparts.
Policymakers can alleviate health inequalities in cities
through comprehensive primary health care, especially
for the poor. Policymakers must at the same time address
related issues like shelter deprivations and slum dwellers’
lack of access to healthy food. Urban health inequalities
must also be redressed with an adequate, functional network
of services that reach out to all sections of the population.
Finally, urban health policies must tackle social inequality in
a proactive manner, since, as mentioned earlier, the urban
poor will continue to depend on market vagaries for health
care and all other aspects of daily life, including employment
and sheer survival.

Education: Opportunities and inequalities in cities

Generalization of basic education in some countries

Education contributes to many important dimensions of
well-being. It has a crucial role to play in poverty reduction,
improved general health, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and,
more generally, enabling people to fulfil their potential. Basic
education is a human right and is central to the Millennium
Declaration, which in the year 2000 pledged that by 2015
boys and girls across the world would be able to complete
a full course of primary education. Today, most national
constitutions acknowledge the right to education, but effective
access can remain a challenge, especially for those living in
poverty. In countries where primary education is compulsory
under law, governments deploy a nationwide education system
with free primary school and social assistance towards indirect
costs like transport and meals. However, effective attendance
and access are rarely enforced in many countries. Parents are
all-too frequently left free to decide whether or not to send
their children to school, and do not face penalties when they
fail to do so. Finally, social inequality in many countries
influences and shapes the education system.

In both Latin America and Asia, schooling is quasi-universal
in urban and rural areas, with few exceptions. In some
African countries, any disparities in enrolment rates remain
small across cities and villages. This is the case in Cameroon,
Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia,
Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia,
as well as in Egypt and Morocco, which also feature in the
UN-HABITAT survey sample. In Egypt, school attendance
rates remain consistent across various areas, with enrolment
rates of 86 per cent in the capital and large cities, 89 per cent
in smaller cities and towns and 84 per cent in rural areas. A
broadly similar pattern is evident in Morocco, where school
enrolment rates are 91 per cent in the capital and large cities,
92 per cent in smaller cities and towns, and 84 per cent in
rural areas.

Access to education is greater in cities than in rural areas

Social and cultural barriers continue to deny slum dwellers
the opportunity to complete basic education.38 Children from
slum communities are less likely to enroll in school, tend to
complete fewer years and are less likely to complete primary
or attend secondary school. Although large majorities of
children in most cities are enrolled in school, the differential
between slum and non-slum areas remains clear. This is
particularly evident in the poorer areas of many African cities,
where primary school enrolment is decreasing. In Eastern and
Southern Africa, rural areas saw the most significant increases
in school enrolment in the late 1990s, and many poor urban
families were left behind. In Tanzania, for example, net
enrolment ratios increased in both rural and non-slum urban
areas, but actually decreased in slum areas. Similar patterns
have been reported in Zambia and Zimbabwe, but are not
confined to sub-Saharan Africa.
For instance in Guatemala, only 54 per cent of children
living in slums were enrolled in primary education in
1999, compared with 73 per cent in non-slum urban
areas and 61 per cent in rural areas. Brazil reported similar
enrolment figures in the late 1990s, too. The educational gap
associated with economic status can be quite substantial.39 In
Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan, for example, fewer than 40
per cent of children in the poorest socioeconomic quintile
complete primary school, compared with 70 to 80 per cent
in the richest quintile. In Sierra Leone, the figures are 20 per
cent and 70 per cent, respectively. Among slum communities
in Nigeria, children are 35 per cent less likely to attend school
than those from non-slum areas. In Bolivia, only 10 per cent
of children in the poorest quintile complete primary school,
as compared with 40 per cent of those in non-slum areas, and
55 per cent of children in the richest quintile.40

The Social Divide – Impact on Bodies and Minds

Cities are hosts to more educational infrastructure than
villages. They provide young people with opportunities to
continue their education and access gainful employment in
the formal sector, but not all cities are alike when it comes
to young people’s education and employment needs. Cities
can also generate and intensify the kind of social exclusion
that denies the benefits of the “urban advantage” to youth
and other marginalized groups, particularly in conditions
of unprecedented urban growth, increasing poverty and
inequality, or inadequate policies. Even within one and the
same city, some youth are able to succeed and prosper while
others drop out of school, fail to find productive employment
and sink into poverty.37
Available data indicates that enrolment rates are in general
much higher in urban than in rural areas. In most of the countries reviewed here, more than 75 per cent of primary education age children in cities attend school, but in rural areas the
proportion drops under 50 per cent. This pattern is most pronounced in Niger, where 73 per cent of children in the capital,
Niamey, attend school, compared with 17 per cent in rural
areas; in smaller cities and towns, 53 per cent of children of
primary school age are enrolled. A similar pattern prevails in
Burkina Faso, where the rural communities lag far behind their
urban counterparts, with enrolment rates of 21 and 73 per cent
respectively. In both Niger and Burkina Faso, as in many African countries, the “urban advantage” is quite clear for both rich
and poor. Enrolment rates in rural areas are mainly dependent
on the availability and accessibility of school facilities.

Cities also generate inequalities in education

113

Inequalities intensify at higher levels of education
In many countries in both the developing and developed
world, the education system perpetuates and reproduces
social inequalities. In China, for instance, research shows that
government policies have fallen short of addressing inequitable
practices: as schools perpetuate and reproduce inequities, a
new system of social stratification emerges on the back of
market forces rather than Socialist principles.41 The American
education system also comes under criticism for perpetuating
the social inequalities of a class hierarchy, which is achieved
through allocation of differential “educational capital” along
class lines.

Education and gender inequality
The education of girls and young women generates
powerful poverty-reducing synergies and yields enormous
intergenerational gains. It is positively correlated with enhanced
economic productivity, more robust labour markets, higher
earnings and improved public health and well-being. Much
has been done in favour of gender equity in education over
the past 15 years. For instance, according to Demographic
and Health Survey data, the rate of girls’ enrolment at the
primary level in low-income countries has grown from 87 per
cent in 1990 to 94 per cent in 2004, signaling a significant
narrowing of the gender gap. This progress was only

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Secondary education, where the returns on knowledge and
skill development are highest, has a particularly important
role to play if children are to acquire the skills and abilities
needed to enter the labour market and become economically
empowered. This is the stage where slum and non-slum
school enrolment rates are seen to diverge widely. Not only
is enrolment of slum-dwelling children lower in secondary
school, but many of those enrolled fail to succeed. As measured
against learning achievement, the quality of educational
services in most poor communities remains low. Research in
both developed and developing countries also underscores the
prime importance of educational quality (as measured by tests
of cognitive achievement) for the level of earnings.42 In the
United States, for example, a one standard deviation increase
in mathematics performance at the end of high school is
associated with 12 per cent higher annual earnings.43

Education inequalities in both learning and earning
outcomes persist in cities. Evidence from Ghana, for example,
shows that although 37 per cent of pupils stay in school
through ninth grade, only 5 per cent are fully literate. In
Brazil, fewer than 22 per cent of pupils attend through ninth
grade, and only 8 per cent are deemed literate. Therefore,
better teaching standards are crucial if the performance of both
boys and girls is to be improved, and equality in educational
outcomes to become effective. Merely building schools and
increasing enrolment without ensuring quality is unlikely
to help countries meet their human capital objectives in an
increasingly knowledge-based global economy. Recognizing
that universal primary education cannot be achieved by
expanding access at the expense of quality, policymakers are
seeking to improve both simultaneously.

Boys’ enrolment takes a downturn
Efforts to improve the education of girls in some countries
have resulted in significant increases in their enrolment
numbers, but today a slight regression in boys’ enrolment
and participation is becoming a cause for concern. In certain
parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East,
and North and Southern Africa, many more girls than boys
are now enrolled. In developed regions and Eastern Asia too,
the gender disparity has reversed, with more girls than boys
now enrolled at the primary level. In Bangladesh, boys are
dropping out of school in much larger numbers than girls
– a phenomenon that is now the country’s most significant
gender challenge – to the point where girls now account for
60 per cent of enrolment in some schools, especially in rural

areas. Improvements in girls’ enrolment have resulted from
eight interrelated strategies, some of which may provide some
insights into ways to keep boys in school, as well: (1) elimination
of user fees; (2) conditional cash transfers; (3) increased
focus on gender inequality; (4) recognition of cultural and
social constraints to girls’ education; (5) improvement in the
economic returns to girls’ education; (6) promotion of postprimary education for girls; (7) making primary education
more gender-sensitive; and (8) developing and disseminating
gender-sensitive school and pedagogical models. Obviously,
none of these strategies can be implemented wholesale to
tackle the regression in boys’ enrolment, although they retain
a general degree of relevance that deserves attention.
Education remains a luxury for the urban poor in the
face of current crises
In those urban areas where income and social inequalities are
significant, many urban families are so poor, or impoverished,
that they cannot ensure basic education for their children. In
urban areas, access to education is often determined by ability
to pay fees more than by the physical proximity of schools,
or by curricula. School fees, costs of uniforms, materials,
exams and other educational expenses have been shown to
affect the chances of children from poor families, and girls
in particular, going to school, as they add to the already high
opportunity costs of letting them leave home to benefit from

The Social Divide – Impact on Bodies and Minds

possible because policymakers clearly recognized the crucial
importance of girls’ education in development as well as the
benefits derived from the “education for all” agenda. Various
policy frameworks, including the “women in development”,
“gender and development”, post-structural and rights-based
approaches, have contributed to gender equality and quality
education in their own way.44 The “women in development”
approach generates clear policy directives on issues such as
the hiring of more female teachers, tracking the number of
girls and women in and out of school, overcoming barriers
to girls’ education, and reaping the benefits of schooling. As
for the “gender and development” approach, it encourages
provision of complementary basic education programmes for
socially excluded girls, as well as gender-sensitive and genderequalizing curricula.
Estimates suggest that gender equality in education has
made uneven progress within regions, though. In 2005, some
72 million children around the world remained out of school,
with a majority (41 million) of girls from groups with multiple
disadvantages and living mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and
Southern Asia. Where girls are still at a disadvantage, resources
and school facilities are limited and enrolment is altogether
low. In many countries with low overall enrolment, fewer
than 50 per cent of primary school-aged girls are involved.
Female illiteracy rates remain high in these parts of the world,
particularly in urban poor and rural areas, where many girls
drop out of school too early to acquire the skills they need
to function as literate individuals. Demographic and Health
Survey data points to four main reasons why girls discontinue
their education: lack of money, early marriage and pregnancy,
domestic work responsibilities, and poor performance. Only
a small proportion – fewer than 10 per cent – of girls and
young women who had left school said it was because they
had graduated. Gender gaps in education have historically
been wider in Pakistan than the world average, with girls
lagging behind boys in terms of access, school standards
and outcomes: in primary education, for instance, the gap
worsened by 30 per cent between 1985 and 1995.45 A similar
situation prevails in Yemen, where 60 per cent of women are
illiterate, compared with a 45 per cent national rate.46

116

The combined social and cultural factors that make it
difficult for girls to enroll and complete school also contribute
to their dissatisfaction and poor performance regarding
education. Combinations of domestic chores, marriage,
motherhood and financial constraints seriously challenge
girls’ ability to maintain regular attendance, or to succeed
when they do attend. Surveys show that poor performance is,
in itself, the reason a significant proportion of urban young
females give for dropping out of school before they complete
their education or pass key national examinations.
Unsafe school environments
Another significant, though rarely mentioned factor
behind low school enrolment in poor urban neighbourhoods
is a perceived lack of safety, especially for girls. Schools in
many slum areas are not child-friendly and in some cases,
they are even hazardous for girls. Failure to provide adequate
sanitary facilities and water services causes inconvenience for
boys, but can make the situation disastrous for girls. During
menstruation, girls will not attend school if basic toilet
facilities are not available. Even where they are, servicing
and maintenance are frequently poor. In many places,
separate facilities for boys and girls are not available, which
leaves girls at risk of sexual harassment. This is especially
the case in those schools that become overcrowded, as they
are too small or too few to serve expanding slum areas. The
heightened risk of sexual violence in poor, overcrowded
classrooms hinders educational prospects for girls. More
or less unwillingly, girls often give in to unwanted sexual
advances from boys or even teachers, leaving them exposed
to unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, HIV/AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases.50 The prevalence of
such violence in schools hinders not only girls’ educational
performance, but also their achievements, self-esteem and
physical and psychological health.
Against this background, Demographic and Health Survey
data shows that a significant proportion of girls who drop out
school do so because they “do not like it”. This is the case for
more than 30 per cent of the young women in urban slum
communities in Mali and Guatemala who had left school,
and for more than 20 per cent in Egypt, Nicaragua, Central
African Republic and Burkina Faso. Lack of safety at school
can also, on its own, be a reason for parents to withdraw their
daughters. In Dhaka, many parents keep their daughters at
home and away from the city’s overcrowded schools, or marry
them off at young ages, which, combined with motherhood,
generally puts an end to any further schooling.51 It is incumbent
on policymakers to recognize the specific vulnerabilities of
girls in schools and, through a set of minimum standards,
mainstream gender equality and protection across all aspects
of education.52

The Social Divide – Impact on Bodies and Minds

formal education. In Dhaka, parents spend around 10 per
cent of household income on school costs for every child, but
this proportion is twice as high (20 per cent) for the poorest
households. UN-HABITAT’s Urban Inequities Survey data
indicates that in Lagos, Casablanca and São Paulo, families in
the poorest income quintile spend more than 25 per cent of
incomes on school costs.
These statistics highlight the economic dilemma poor
urban families are facing, caught as they are between securing
a better future for their children through education, on the
one hand, and meeting their own and their children’s needs
for basic sustenance, housing, transportation and privatized
basic services like water and sanitation, on the other hand.
In slums, a majority of parents postpone sending their
children, especially girls, to school, until they can take care of
other expenses such as food, rent and transportation. In the
meantime, children are expected to assist with domestic work
and menial, low-earning jobs.
The direct effects of the financial and food crises are
devastating for poor urban families who were already
struggling to send at least one child to school. Today in
many developing countries, the children of poor families
face the most straightforward of dilemmas: food, or school.
The immediate future is secured, if only barely, at the cost
of forgoing opportunities for a better, longer-term future.
For parents, postponing new enrolments and withdrawing
enrolled children are the only options.47 Girls are the typical
first casualties of this hard choice,48 as suggested by DHS
data. In the urban areas of Uganda and Zambia, for instance,
74 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, of young females
between the ages of 15 and 24 mentioned inability to pay as
the main reason they stopped going to school.
In Latin America, the impact of the financial crisis on
education can be more visible in larger than in smaller
cities. This is particularly the case in Bolivia, where 93 per
cent of children in small cities and towns are enrolled in
primary education, compared with 68 per cent in the capital
and other large cities, and 72 per cent in rural areas. This
disparity between large and smaller cities could be explained
by the deep inequalities that characterize larger urban areas.
A similar situation prevails in Colombia, though to a lesser
degree, with 82 per cent of children in smaller cities attending
school, compared with 73 per cent in large cities – the same as
the percentage of rural children enrolled in school.
Among some impoverished urban communities in Africa,
it is common practice for families to have boys educated in
their village of origin, where schools are less expensive, while
girls remain at home in the city to help with housework.49 In
2007, girls already accounted for 54 per cent of the world’s
out-of-school population, a percentage that is only likely to
increase. In times of crisis, school attendance always declines
in developing countries; the tragedy is that some children
may never return.

Most national and international literacy and education
programmes so far have focused on reducing the urban/rural
gap in education, overlooking the divide between rich and
poor that prevails in urban areas. Although much remains to
be done in rural areas, these have seen significant increases
in enrolment over the past 10 years, and the simultaneous
decreases in impoverished urban communities. In this regard,
in Bangladesh as in many other countries, non-governmental
organizations have traditionally maintained a rural focus;
they have only recently begun to turn their attention to urban
areas and to understand the particular educational challenges
posed by slum populations.
If school enrolment and achievement are to be improved in
poor urban areas, a combination of incentives that stimulates
both demand and supply is required. On the demand side,
incentives for poor families can include stipends, scholarships,
free textbooks and learning materials, safe and affordable
transportation schemes, and community awareness campaigns.
On the supply side, it is for public authorities to build more
secondary schools in poor urban areas or, alternatively, add
boarding facilities to existing schools. Furthermore, direct
linkages between secondary education and local work
opportunities are required if graduates’ employment prospects
are to be enhanced. This type of scheme can boost both
enrolment and achievement for all underprivileged groups,
including girls and children from poor urban areas.
A comparison of the effects of eliminating school fees across
several countries showed that enrolment rates rise dramatically
wherever fees are abolished.53 Elimination of fees in Malawi in
1994, for example, increased net enrolment from 68 to 99 per
cent, and gross enrolment from 89 to 113 per cent in a single
year. In Yemen, the government has launched cash and noncash incentive programmes based on school attendance, on top
of specific incentives such as exemption from fees for textbook
costs, with the deliberate aim of increasing girls’ enrolment and
retention rates.54 The Yemeni government has also hired more
female teachers and established a Girls’ Education Sector in the
Ministry of Education, headed by a female deputy minister.
During the same period, the gain in boys’ enrolment was
more modest, at only 14 per cent. Trends in secondary school
enrolment over the same period were similarly lopsided, with
increases of 162 per cent for girls and 60 per cent for boys.
However, changes in enrolment patterns have been found to
be potentially detrimental if schools do not receive financial
compensation for the loss of much-needed resources such as
fees. In Yemen, the combination of increased enrolment and
loss of textbook fees has led schools to complain about budget
shortages, as fees provide the resources for everyday tasks and
programmes. In this regard, income targeting is an alternative
to abolition of fees, as it allows cross-subsidization between
those families that can afford higher fees and those on lower
incomes who cannot. However, this alternative is only available
when pupils are from a variety of backgrounds, which may
be more unlikely in slum than in non-slum areas. The next
best alternative is to help low-income families with the direct

costs of education through conditional cash transfers and free
transportation to school.
It is also important to consider the “geographical dimension
of inclusive education”, i.e., to pay more attention to inclusive
education at the local and national levels. Highlighting
social deprivation at the local level provides an incentive
for policymakers and others to gain better understanding
of the specific situation for students in each school, and
create an opening for community participation in school
improvement.55
In this second part of the report, the focus has gradually
narrowed, from the characteristic dimensions of the urban
divide and its current degree of prevalence across the world
to its most tangible effects on those that have most to suffer
from exclusion on a day-to-day basis. Overall, the evidence
points to a continuum of deprivations on the wrong side of
the urban divide, and they all call for redistributive change.
This and the four preceding chapters have highlighted
various aspects of the paradox – some would say the scandal
– that characterizes too many urban areas in this early 21st
century. Cities concentrate what has become known as the
“urban advantage”, namely, a bundle of opportunities which,
from basic and health services to education, amenities and
gainful employment, have never been so favourable to human
development. At the same time, in the developing world,
cities also concentrate higher degrees of inequality than in
rural areas – the urban divide. In fact, standards in slums and
other low-income urban settlements can be as low as they
remain in the countryside.
The other paradox – or scandal – of early 21st century cities
is that not only do the benefits associated with urban life
keep eluding the poorer segments of their populations, but
these opportunities are more particularly denied to women
and young people, who have such obvious vital roles to play
in our collective future. This is why, as the continuum of
urban deprivations described in each chapter has increasingly
focused on the physical impact of slums and poverty on the
bodies and minds of ordinary human beings, the number of
recommendations for public authorities has also increased
and gained in urgency in this Report.
Just as Part 2 identifies the failings and inadequacies in economic and social policies that lie behind the urban divide,
Part 3 reintroduces the political and cultural dimensions of
equality in order better to focus on remedies. The current
state of urban inequality may represent only a transient phase
in a broader, economics-driven dynamic; still, the ongoing
waste of human capital and the attendant risks of social and
political instability should act as incentives to make that transition as short as possible through redistributive change. As
discussed in Part 3, bridging the urban divide calls for a more
holistic vision–the “inclusive city”. Whether or not a municipality formally endorses the concept of the “right to the city”,
a rights-based approach has two related benefits: it can put
policymakers in a better position to identify the specific dynamics of integration at work locally, and to activate the various types of leverage that can bring about an “inclusive city”.

recent Demographic and Health Surveys available in the
selected countries and analyzed by UN-HABITAT.
Where population density is low, and where soils
can absorb water easily (e. g. sandy soils with a low
groundwater level), some form of septic tank has
been found to provide a safe and economic method
of sewage disposal. The tank itself does not treat
the sewage, and the water flowing out of it is highly
contaminated; it is the soil into which the contaminated
water flows that does the real ‘filtering’ of the sewage.
However, where the water coming out of a septic
tank system cannot be absorbed by the soil (and
therefore runs along the ground), the system becomes
a significant environmental health hazard and a septic
tank is no longer appropriate. Septic tanks should not be
located too close to drinking water supplies and pipes,
as any leak is liable to contaminate drinking water.
Research on overcrowding in low-income settlements
conducted by UN-HABITAT in 1995 confirmed that
infectious diseases are likely to thrive in overcrowded
and low-income areas due to lack of ventilation and
hygiene as well as unhealthy environmental exposures.
Supportive evidence has shown that diseases run
rampant in crowded places.

Romieu, & Bruce, 2000; Engle, Hurtado & Ruel, 1997.
Potential harm is the greatest for children under one
year, since their lungs and immune system are not
yet fully formed. Household use of biomass fuels has
been found to significantly increase the risk of acute
respiratory infections, which annually kill millions of
children under age five (Smith, Samet, Romieu, & Bruce,
2000).
Raffensperger, 2007. Human exposure to these
pollutants indoors is compounded in homes with close
quarters and poor ventilation. Even low levels of indoor
air pollution can negatively affect health because of
the proportionally large amount of time families spend
indoors. For that reason, researchers now take into
account not only pollutant concentration but amount of
time spent in each environment, calculating individual
“time-activity patterns”. Using this metric, the number
of people exposed at unacceptable levels indoors is
equivalent to or greater than the number exposed to
unacceptable levels outdoors in all the world’s cities
combined (Smith, Samet, Romieu, & Bruce, 2000).
Though no international standards for indoor air pollution
exist, studies show that daily average levels of small
particles in households that burn solid fuels are six to
60 times the World Health Organization air pollution
guidelines (Rehfuess, Mehta & Prüss-Üstün, 2006).

school have increased their enrollment, attendance, and
test scores relative to those of regular public schools.

For a better understanding of hunger and food
deprivation in urban areas, UN-HABITAT has analyzed
Demographic and Health Survey and Multiple Indicator
Cluster Survey data on child nutrition in Africa, Asia and
Latin America and the Caribbean. Child malnutrition
is assessed here as including both acute malnutrition
(wasting) and chronic malnutrition (stunting). A child
can be underweight for her or his age because s/he has
suffered from “wasting”, “stunting” or both. Wasting
may be the result of inadequate food intake or recent
episodes of illness causing loss of weight and the onset
of malnutrition.
The wealth index measurement is used here to stratify
the urban population into quintiles (poorest, second
quintile, middle, fourth, and richest).
This analysis only includes countries with at least two
sets of DHS data.

3.1
Quick Facts	
1.	 The “right to the city” concept has been put to
use to varying degrees of success over the past
half-century, although some countries have
ignored or spurned it altogether.

Taking forward the
right to the city

The “urban advantage” for all

2.	 The “right to the city” must not be viewed as a
new legal instrument, but instead subsumes a
wide range of universally recognized human
rights into a single claim for enforcement in
urban areas.
3.	 Many cities in the developing world devise
and enforce inclusive policies that abide by
national and international commitments without
any explicit reference to the “right to the city.”
4.	 Whether they formally endorse the “right to
the city” or not, many municipal authorities
are institutionally ill-equipped to make this
right effective, including when it comes to
coordination with national and state/provincial
government.

Policy Points	

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

1.	 Individual or collective economic
marginalization frequently extends to access
to social services, cultural expression and
political participation.

122

2.	 The “right to the city” can provide municipal
authorities with the platform they need for
a wide range of policies and initiatives that
promote an “inclusive” urban environment.
3.	 A strong human rights-based approach
upholds the dignity of all urban residents in the
face of multiple rights violations, including the
right to decent living conditions.
4.	 The right to the city calls for a holistic, balanced
and multicultural type of urban development,
including mixed neighbourhoods.
5.	 The basic principle behind the right to the
city is that human rights are interdependent
and indivisible, i.e., they are to be pursued
simultaneously, if only achieved gradually over
time.
6.	 Municipal rights-based approaches must be
deployed in all policy areas, including land
use, planning, management and reform, and in
close cooperation with government bodies and
civil society.

A

s described in Part 2, various lines of divide
combine to deprive large numbers of residents
from access to many of the opportunities cities
have to offer - the “urban advantage”. The often
vital contribution of those in low-earning jobs to urban
prosperity is not properly recognized not just in economic
but also civic, political, cultural and other terms. They can
neither fully realize their productive potential nor participate
effectively in the decisions that impact on their lives. They are
not socially integrated and often carry the stigma of the urban
area where they reside. They are also denied opportunities to
contribute to the city’s cultural life and style.
How do cities close the urban divide? How do they
become more inclusive, economically, politically, socially
and culturally? What principles, platforms and strategies can
public authorities deploy to bridge the current divide and
make cities more inclusive? These are the questions virtually
all the regions of the world are facing in this early 21st century,
whether highly developed, emerging, in transition or postconflict situations. They are as relevant to highly centralized
nations and to those with devolved government, East, West,
North and South.
The concept has been deployed differently in various
regions, countries and cities of the world. Some places have
applied the “Right to the City” as a theoretical, political,
conceptual framework that refers to such aspects as
enforcement, empowerment, participation, self-realization,
self-determination, and different forms of protection of
existing human rights at the city level. In other places, the
concept is absent from the political discourse, either not
used at all, or banned outright. Where the concept has been
applied, it has not always achieved higher levels of inclusion;
large numbers of people, particularly in the developing
world, do not fully benefit from the “urban advantage”, do
not participate in decision-making and do not enjoy effective
fundamental rights and liberties, while others do, live in

Box 3.1.1: “Participation” and “citizenship”: Latin America’s ambiguous rhetoric
Raquel Rolnik
In Latin America over the past few decades, an
intense debate has enthralled civil society, political
parties and governments–one over the role played
by citizens in urban governance. Those years were
also marked by the pursuit of a decentralized model
and stronger local autonomy. Some significant legal breakthroughs are worthy of note in connection
with the right to housing and the right to the city:
several national constitutions and statute books
(such as with the City Statute in Brazil) have come
to include the principles of the social function of
the city and property, the recognition of occupation rights for millions of slum dwellers, and the
empowerment of citizens in urban decisionmaking.
This rights-based approach has been advocated by
social movements, non-government organizations,
trade unions, and academic or research institutions, as part of campaigns in favour of democratic
municipal management and the right to the city.
This, in turn, came as a response to one of the
fastest and most intense social and geographical
phenomena ever witnessed: the massive reshaping of a typically rural into a predominantly urban
population in fewer than 40 years (up until 1980).
This was when urbanization in Latin America saw
vast contingents of poor rural migrants run against
a model of urban development that typically excluded the lower-income segments of the population, depriving them from any sense of citizenship
or local belonging.

The “agenda of urban reform” has subsequently
been endorsed over time by Brazil’s political
parties and governments. At the same time,
though, Latin American cities, and large metropolitan areas in particular, came under the influence of the neoliberal macroeconomic reforms
that burgeoned in the early 1990s, resulting in
massive unemployment and the erosion of social institutions. The process only exacerbated
already existing social and economic asymmetries, ultimately hindering the capacity of public authorities and social stakeholders to cope
with them. These reforms extended to the
whole government sector, including privatization of public utilities, plans to modernize and
downsize government, introduction of entrepreneurial management, and a “participatory”
rhetoric emphasizing the role of civil society.
A kind of “perverse convergence” brought
together–if only in a shared rhetoric–various
political projects that pointed out to different
directions. The participatory-democratic project has its origins in the challenge to authoritarian regimes, and ambitioned to build a new
institutional reality to pave the way for a new
social and cultural dispensation. Now collectively dubbed “the third sector” (alongside the
government and market sectors), civil society
was caught up in a movement that looked to
downsize government in the name of “participation” and “citizenship”.

The shared rhetoric conceals differences and
minimizes antagonisms, emphasizing social, political and territorial fragmentation while diluting
the promise of a full-fledged democratic endeavour in the form of full and universal access to
civil, political, economic and social rights. As far
as urban development models are more specifically concerned, the rhetoric of “participation”
and “citizenship” implies that all citizens, regardless of income, ethnicity, race, creed or gender,
are entitled to full access to the goods, services
and opportunities that are locally available for
the purposes of human development.
For about two decades now, urban reform
across Latin America has had its ups and
downs, hostage as it was to both this novel
rhetoric and an enduring legacy of predatory
territorial management by the more privileged.
The “participatory” rhetoric has failed to pave
the way for the dynamic relationship with mainstream political parties that could have boosted
the quest for more cohesive, inclusive and sustainable cities. On the other hand, the rhetoric of
“participation” and “citizenship” has continued
to challenge urban policies in Latin America. As
such, it has been a source of cultural innovation
and civic rights promotion, and has expanded
the spatial and political scope of Latin American
democracy.

An architect and urban planner, Raquel Rolnik was appointed United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing in 2008.

Evolution of the right to the city
The right to the city has evolved over the past 50 years
under the influence of social groups and civil society
organizations in response to the need for better opportunities
for all, especially the more marginalized and underprivileged.
In 2004, social movements and organizations from around
the world together devised a World Charter on the Right to
the City, with support from UNESCO and UN-HABITAT,
among other agencies. This in turn led to the adoption of
local charters in a number of cities.
The right to the city should not be viewed as a new legalistic
instrument, but rather as an expression of the deep yearnings
of urban dwellers to see their multiple human rights become
more effective in urban areas.1 In this perspective, the right
to the city serves as a bulwark against the exclusionary
types of development, the selective benefit-sharing and the
marginalization and discrimination that are rampant in cities
today. The right to the city provides an adequate platform for
action as well as a framework for human rights enforcement.

Taking Forward the right to the city

decent, healthy and environmentally friendly places with full
exercise of their citizenship. Some other countries have made
important efforts to close the urban divide without the overt
use of the concept. Despite these ambiguities, the “Right to
the City” remains a powerful vehicle for social change that
warrants serious consideration.
What follows is a review of the “Right to the City” as it
has been applied explicitly and implicitly in various regions,
countries and cities. An effort is made to discern key principles
that underlie the concept so that these might inform efforts
by cities to promote inclusion and close the urban divide,
even in regions where the historical, political and cultural
conditions are not conducive to an explicit application of the
“Right to the City” approach. The chapter reviews the factors
that limit the ability of cities to translate policy into effective
practice. These include poor coordination among tiers of
government, absence of data for informed policy choices,
influence of vested interests, weak adjustment to changing
economic conditions, exclusion of marginalized groups and
discrimination of minorities.

So far, few countries or cities have given formal, explicit
recognition to the right to the city in those of their policies,
strategies or legislations that look to narrow the urban divide.
Brazil was the first country to include in its Constitution
(1988) a specific chapter on urban policy. Coming in response
to years of dictatorship, this progressive body of law called
on municipal authorities to deploy a range of instruments
that could guarantee the right to the city, uphold the social
function of cities and property, and make urban management
more democratic.2 At nationwide level, Brazil’s City Statute
(2001) is a groundbreaking body of legislation that redefines
the concept of land ownership as it asserts the social value
of urban land.3 In São Paulo, the largest city in the country,
experts surveyed by UN-HABITAT concurred that “talking
about rights is talking about the right to the city”.4 One
expert defined this right as “the equal enjoyment of cities
within the principles of sustainability, democracy and social
justice”. Furthermore, “a city is a collective space, culturally
rich and diversified, that belongs to all residents. The right
to the city is an important entitlement to be claimed for by
all those groups, both mainstream and marginalized, that live
and interact in the city”.5
Still in Latin America, in 2008 Ecuador recognized
several housing-related rights in its new Constitution.6 This
pioneering, progressive statute simultaneously endorses: (1)
the right to the city; (2) the right to adequate and dignified
housing; (3) the right to a secure and healthy habitat; and
(4) the right to water and sanitation.7 Responding to the
UN-HABITAT survey, an expert from Portoviejo, Ecuador,
commented that “the right to the city [stood for] broad
and unrestricted access to services, opinions, freedom of
movement and access to space and economic opportunities”.
He added that “this right is, in its broader sense, endorsed by
decisionmakers, as well as recognized and implemented by the
community in everyday life through widespread practice.” 8
Many other cities in the developing world devise and deploy
policies in compliance with national legal commitments to
more inclusive communities, and although they fall short of
explicit references to the right to the city per se, they endorse
some particular aspects of the notion. For example, Rosario,
Argentina‘s third largest city, has declared itself a “Human Rights
City” with a formal commitment to openness, transparency
and accountability. The municipality has opened itself up to
scrutiny by a citizens’ committee that monitors performance
against international law on a continuing basis, making
recommendations and organizing human rights training
and awareness campaigns.9 Another commendable example
is the Victoria Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities
(2006) in Australia, which “recognizes that everyone is
equally entitled to participate in, and contribute to, society
and (the) community”. The charter further sets out that “all
individuals have equal rights to the provision of, and access
to, Council services and facilities”.10 The purpose of the 20
rights that are recognized in the Victoria charter is to “assist

all people to live in freedom, respect, equality and dignity”.
The practical rationale is to secure effective rights recognition
in all municipal planning and policymaking functions,
anticipating on and preventing human rights infringements.
This is why the Charter “requires all public authorities and
their employees to act in compatibility with human rights in
the delivery of services and when making decisions”.11
Relevant urban policies and practices integrate aspects of
democratic governance that are either explicitly or implicitly
consistent with the “right to the city” concept. For instance
in Dakar, municipal leaders and local authorities in 2003
endorsed a “Civic and Citizens’ Pact” which sets out reciprocal
responsibilities among signatories. The pact commits
municipal authorities to acknowledge the diversity of cultures
and beliefs among all residents; conversely, community-based
organizations have agreed to act in a socially responsible way.12
In India in 2001, a municipal authority has enacted a largely
similar “Citizens Charter” that redefines its own functions
in relation to residents’ rights and expectations, with due
regard for the need for reform and to hear public grievances.13
This repositioning of municipal authorities was pioneered
in the 1980s by the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre , with its
participatory budgeting (Orçamento Participativo) on which
over 70 cities around the world have since modeled their own
procedures.14 In 2004 came another improvement, known
as the Local Solidarity Governance Programme; this scheme
further entrenches participatory budgeting, with all Porto
Alegre residents invited to sit in forums where projects for the
next city budget are proposed and prioritized. The programme
is implemented across the city’s 17 municipal subdivisions,
turning Porto Alegre into a “networked participatory city”.15
A number of cities in India, Ghana, South Africa, Colombia,
Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and other Latin American countries are
also taking forward the right to the city concept in a variety
of spheres (social, economic, political and cultural). However,
progress is often rather slow and sometimes runs into
continuous setbacks. This is the case in Mexico and Argentina,
where various efforts keep stalling because the four dimensions
of the inclusive city are not involved simultaneously. In some
cities and countries, particularly in South-Eastern and Eastern
Asia and North Africa, economic growth policies have gone
hand in hand with positive social developments such as
broad provision of basic services, improved literacy and life
expectancy rates, and reductions in the prevalence of hunger
and extreme poverty. These cities enjoy a decent quality of
life; however, political rights and freedom are lagging behind.
The Washington, D.C.-based non-governmental organization
Freedom House (in its annual Freedom in the World report)
rates some of those countries as “not free” (North Africa and
East Asia) or “partly free” (Morocco and South-East Asia
(except “free” Indonesia). Still, other cities and countries,
mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and Western Asia, are looking
to deploy legal and political frameworks based on equality
and rights.

Factors restricting the right to the city:
The disjuncture between policy aims and processes
For all their noteworthy efforts, those municipalities
committed to a “right to the city” approach and those that
have pursued other concepts of inclusion share a common
feature, namely, a certain disjuncture between policy and
process. Few have managed fully to turn policies aims into
processes that actually bridge the urban divide and achieve
more inclusiveness.

In some cities, the disjuncture between policy aims and
processes is not only the result of limited institutional and
organizational capacities; it also has to do with rent-seeking
groups that lobby for their vested interests to the detriment of
other residents, as highlighted in the UN-HABITAT survey.
Moreover, policy aims and processes often do not match
because they fail to acknowledge the inter-linkages among
the four spheres or dimensions of the inclusive city. This in
turn has to do largely with the persistent view of development
as synonymous with economic growth, with little attention
paid to other dimensions of inclusiveness such as the need
for distributive policies, more effective channels of social and
political participation, and recognition of cultural diversity.
The problem with development strategies has been that

Lack of coordination between national, provincial and
local authorities
Table 3.1.1 shows that an overwhelming majority of
cities surveyed across the three regions of the developing
world feature very poor coordination for both planning and
implementation on urban issues across national, provincial
and municipal governments (first column left). Data in the
table also confirms the weak linkage between coordination
for planning and coordination for implementation (middle
column), with fewer than 25 per cent of respondents from
cities in Latin America and Asia reckoning that coordination
was effective among the three tiers of government. This
comes as a reminder that even where municipal authorities
develop elaborate master plans with some kind of support
from regional and central government, these are not matched
by budget allocations or the organizational or technical skills
that would ensure that implementation effectively involves
the three tiers of government.
For instance, the master plan for Abuja, Nigeria’s capital
since 1991, was consciously designed in 1979 by various tiers
of government with help from a foreign consultancy, and
underwent further, multi-agency revisions after the year 2000.
At the design stage, the master plan provided the platform
needed to bridge the divide between rich and poor, making
adequate provisions for inclusion in its different dimensions.
Still, the process of turning the dream into reality is running
into serious problems. As one of the local respondents to
the UN-HABITAT survey commented, “implementation
is not inclusive socially, politically or economically”.17 The
high degree of institutional coordination among government
agencies and various partners in the design stage has gone
missing during the implementation phase.

Taking Forward the right to the city

Part of the problem lies in a wide range of pressures, including urban expansion (or various forms of contraction, as
the case may be), historical socioeconomic inequalities and
grinding poverty, together with environmental degradation
and natural disasters as compounded by the effects of climate
change, among other threats. This is particularly the case
with those cities in the developing world that experience serious resource constraints and lack the inclusive mechanisms
and institutions required to bridge the urban divide. These
cities have not yet devised proper programmes or initiatives
to reduce inequality and tackle service shortfalls; they lack
the mechanisms that would enable them to understand and
anticipate some of the factors generating further inequalities
(i.e., scarcity of land and concentration of ownership in very
few hands; lack of redistributive policies; ineffective housing
markets, etc.). Leaders in these cities have not demonstrated
the strength of vision or political commitment needed to
overcome the urban divide. Even cities with a stronger resource base are also struggling to implement more inclusive
policies. They are typically hampered by five main factors:
(1) weak institutions, often with outdated mandates and responsibilities; (2) multiple agencies, operating together with
overlapping functions and poor results; (3) lack of adequate
human and financial resources; (4) poor performance of fiscal
and administrative systems; and (5) lack of harmony between
political and technical interests, which results for instance in
unethical planning practices or budget allocations to non-priority areas. Various other factors also hinder efforts to bridge
the urban divide, contributing both to the cause and consequences of poor policies and ineffective urban governance.

they view development as a technical problem requiring
technical solutions,16 instead of a systemic, organic process
that includes all four critical dimensions of society. Any
degree of recognition that is given to the four dimensions
at the policymaking stage is often lost in the process of
implementation. UN-HABITAT policy analysis found that
cities frequently adopt new laws and regulations to address
some exclusion-related issues, but these fail to turn into
goalposts, sustained processes or tangible results that can be
monitored. The reason for this disjuncture often lies in the
institutional frameworks themselves: over time, they tend
gradually to embed negative and rather inefficient attitudes,
as well as informal social arrangements that are impervious
to change. This is most evident in the lack of planning
and coordination among central, regional and municipal
institutions in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

127

Table 3.1.1 also shows that large majorities of experts in
Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean reckon there is
hardly any coordination for planning and implementation
between the three tiers of government (third column right).
On the other hand, and somewhat surprisingly, only 41 per
cent of experts in Africa report a lack of such coordination in
their respective cities. This relatively favourable return reflects
the fact that the survey sample includes Accra, Dakar, Durban
and Johannesburg – four cities where well-coordinated
planning and implementation is supported by adequate
efforts and resources.
Surveyed experts perceived coordination among government
agencies to be more effective for the promotion of economic
growth and inclusion than for cultural and political inclusion.
Findings were that central governments tend to formulate
and implement national policies and programmes with only
some minor degree of involvement by local authorities as far
as political and cultural inclusion is concerned. In some other
cases, however, these initiatives originate with local authorities,
but regional and central government shows little support or
interest to collaborate. As a result, coordination is far from
uniformly effective across the four dimensions that make up
an inclusive city: some plans and actions related to economic
and social development and inclusion tend to be better
coordinated than those for cultural and political inclusion,
which typically tend to attract only poor coordination. This
is confirmed again by UN-HABITAT survey returns, which
show that lack of policy focus (on all aspects of inclusion, as
opposed to the mere promotion of economic opportunities)
and absence of political will are two of the most critical factors
hindering municipal inclusion policies in the three developing
regions (see Table 3.1.2).

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Making informed policy choices

128

In addition to lack of clear institutional coordination,
ill-informed policymaking contributes substantially to
municipal failure to integrate the four dimensions of equality
in any “organic” manner. The UN-HABITAT survey sought
to capture the extent to which informed policymaking was
an essential part of slum upgrading policies in the 27 cities
under review. The finding is that fewer than 50 per cent of
survey respondents across Africa, Asia and Latin America
and the Caribbean thought that slum upgrading policies
were informed and based on sound local data. This result
corroborates previous UN-HABITAT research as part of the
Urban Indicators Programme, where 80 out of 120 cities
surveyed admitted to lacking the institutional capabilities and
human skills required to monitor urban growth. Municipalities’
lack of technical skills is a reflection of a more general state of
national underdevelopment. The 2009 UN-HABITAT survey
found that Latin American cities were better equipped than
those in Asia, which in turn outdid Africa. Even where some
degree of institutional capacity can be found, institutional
inertia in resource-poor environments leads to gradual erosion
of any processes that promote coordination. Those institutions

whose mandates involve urban planning and implementation
are, more often than not, keener to preserve their respective
turfs and assert their self-importance than to focus on proper
planning and urban harmony.
Interest group influence
In the 27 cities surveyed by UN-HABITAT, powerful
political and interest group influences were found to interfere
with inclusive urban policies. These influences frequently take
different forms that can be illustrated with two examples: (1)
poor provision of public spaces and related services for all
residents, and (2) arbitrary conversion or grabbing of public
or reserved land by powerful interests. For example, religious
groups in India are erecting temples in public parks; private
interests in Bangladesh are constructing massive real estate
developments along riverbanks; and developers and informal
settlers in Nairobi, Kenya are constantly claiming riparian
lands. Undue appropriation of critical public spaces by
private entities often goes unnoticed, or is even promoted by
municipal authorities. Similarly, changing the status of land
from rural to urban on the periphery of expanding cities is
typically associated with speculative investments by those
better-off, and almost automatically excludes the poor and
underprivileged.
In the city of Guadalajara, Mexico, recent research
confirmed the findings of the UN-HABITAT survey. Because
of relentless expansion of developments on the outskirts of
the city, some 30 per cent of this new housing stock remains
unoccupied, even as in the inner city a similar percentage
goes underused.18 This situation highlights the speculative
patterns of investment at work, which are largely influenced
by powerful interests. The experts responding to the UNHABITAT survey pointed to the urban rich, political elites
and civil servants as the interest groups that most benefit from
urban expansion and reform. Table 3.1.3 shows that 59 per
cent of Latin American, 69 per cent of Asian and 71 per cent
of African respondents viewed urban reforms and changes
as serving the interests of the rich. Similarly, politicians and
bureaucrats are viewed as the second major group benefiting
the most from the urbanization process, with the exception
of Africa where they are considered to be the greatest
beneficiaries (77 per cent). This goes to show that the urban
poor in general stand to share only to a minimal extent, if at
all, in any benefits accruing from urbanization and related
reforms. The survey findings reflect the relatively more stable
and accountable forms of democracy prevailing in Latin
American as opposed to Asian and African cities. They also
point to the extent of misallocation of scarce budget resources
to non-priority areas as a result of interest group influences.
More generally, planning and policies appear to favour
the empowered, mainly local and regional economic elites.
In the developing world, this pattern is more often than
not associated with historical and cultural hegemony, which
adds to the inter-generational aspects of urban exclusion that
lead to spatial partitioning and gentrification. Moreover, in

addition to gentrification, a number of other large projects
and events have created urban environments that are of little
benefit to the poor. These have included large infrastructure
projects (water, sanitation and roads), “city beautification”,
riverfront development schemes and facilities for major
global sports and cultural events.
Building facilities for cultural mega-events has on occasion
led to the resettlement of underprivileged communities (Seville
1992, Shanghai 2010), as have political mega-events (Manila
1976, Seoul 1985), or sporting mega-events such as the Olympic
Games, World Football Cup, Commonwealth Games and
other regional events which, in some cases, can result in some

forms of discrimination and inequality, such as forced evictions
of people living in slums and informal settlements to make
way for infrastructure development (Beijing 2008, New Delhi
2010, Vancouver 2010). These sporting mega-events can also
result in displacement of homeless people (Osaka 2002, Seoul
2002). Each of these events has more indirect consequences
as well. For example, infrastructure improvements through
redevelopment can lead to decreases in the public housing
stock and an escalation in real estate prices, which makes
housing unaffordable for many low-income residents and
other marginalized groups. The desire to “show off” a city and
make it an attractive tourist destination is often accompanied

Region

129

by a process of “sanitization”, i.e., a “clean-up” of public areas
that is facilitated by criminalization of the homeless­ and
increased brutality by police forces. Rebuilding a city’s image
appears, from the examples of many mega-events, to mean
making it more attractive for local, national and international
elites (middle- and high-income earners), and as a result, less
livable for those who fall outside these categories.19
The most excluded groups: A typology

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

A review of the various forms of exclusion and the layers
of horizontal discrimination in selected cities shows that
multiple forms of discrimination overlap at any given time.
As one of the experts from Latin America commented as part
of the UN-HABITAT survey, “when one is [economically]
poor, one is also poor and excluded in a cultural, social and
political sense”.20 Indeed, survey results have shown that
when an individual or group is marginalized from economic
opportunities, it is very likely that this condition extends to
access to social services, expression of cultural identity and
participation in political life. Exclusion in this sense “results
from a complex and dynamic set of processes and relationships
that prevent individuals and groups from accessing resources,
participating in society and asserting their rights”.21

130

Individuals and groups can find themselves excluded from
the right to vote, the right to enter and enjoy all areas of the
city, the right to use social and cultural facilities and venues,
the right to access basic services, and various other rights which
effectively restrict their full enjoyment of the right to the city.
It is worthy of note that, from a list of categories or groups
(women and children, the elderly, the disabled, uneducated
people, migrants, ethnic groups and other minorities in terms
of race or caste, people on low incomes and slum dwellers),
three appear to be the most systematically excluded in various
cities in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean: the
disabled, the elderly and slum dwellers, followed by the
uneducated (for African cities, see Figure 3.1.1). In cities like
Dakar, Mombasa, Abuja, Chittagong, Kathmandu, Dhaka,
Port-au-Prince and Buenos Aires, slum dwellers are the most
excluded from the various urban functions.
Exclusion is entrenched and rooted in the long history
of marginalization and hierarchy that permeates the social
patterns of individual cities. The urban poor, and slum dwellers
in particular, go unnoticed and the places where they live are
often not formally recognized by local or central authorities.
However, in many parts of the world these “invisible” areas
are growing faster than the “visible” ones.22 Excluded groups
in slum areas typically fall victim to a sort of triple jeopardy:

(1) they are poor and uneducated; (2) many are migrants or
from ethnic minorities; and (3) many are female. As long as
municipal authorities remain unaware of these groups and the
underlying causes of their exclusion, they will remain unable
to find effective ways to support them, and will fail them in
a systematic way.
If city authorities are effectively to address the needs of
these and other excluded groups, they must recognize that
their systematic marginalization is unfair and avoidable – a
wholesale denial of their “right to the city”. This calls for informed discussions, negotiating support and proposing policies and actions that tackle the root causes and persistence of
disadvantage, marginalization and exclusion. Municipal authorities must also devise a number of short- and long-term
strategic responses to be delivered by all relevant organizations
and institutions as part of anti-exclusion policies, with proper
monitoring mechanisms. Otherwise, cities will persistently
fail to acknowledge, uphold and fulfil the rights of all the individuals under their jurisdictions.
Co-evolution of policies with urban expansion and needs
Cities are constantly changing. They are built, rebuilt,
transformed and inhabited by various groups, and used for
various functions. In this sense, planning comes as an attempt
to bring some order to this constant process of transformation.
However, the evolution of cities in the developing world is
under pressure from the multiple forces that make it difficult
for planners and decision-makers to manage. As urban labour
market structures steer away from manufacturing to services
and high technology, it is important to provide the working
poor with opportunities to retrain for jobs in the new growth
sectors. The UN-HABITAT survey highlights a relative
predominance of manufacturing and unskilled labour across
the three regions under review. However, Asian cities feature
far higher percentages of service and high-technology workers
compared with Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Unskilled jobs, including in the services sector, are, by nature,
less well-paid than high-technology jobs, and people in these
categories tend to be economically underprivileged. Also
needed are economic and fiscal incentives to support the
economic transition process, particularly for small enterprises.
However, in many cities these support schemes lag behind the
economic transition process because of resource constraints,
weak institutions and inadequate policies. This is how and
why cities struggle to catch up with these structural changes,
leaving large sections of the population behind and in the
process exacerbating the urban divide.

Table 3.1.4 shows that policies in support of urban
economic change are lacking in Asia and Latin America. Local
experts responding to the UN-HABITAT survey found that
African cities provided relatively more vocational training
(23 per cent), a perception that largely reflects tangible
achievements in Accra and Ibadan. Elsewhere in Africa,
though, vocational training clearly falls short of improving
the labour market. Likewise, local experts reported that
promotion of employment through simplified procedures
was not happening in Latin American or African cities, and
remained rather minimal in Asia. Deregulation, incentives
and more favourable regulations were equally found lacking
in Latin America and Asia, while Africa’s relatively better
ranking was entirely due to Johannesburg’s strong individual
performance. Another significant way of reducing inequalities
of income and opportunities is state-created employment, a
major source of labour-intensive jobs for unskilled or semiskilled workers. UN-HABITAT survey respondents ranked
state-created employment higher than other factors, though
still relatively low. Although well-adapted to the needs of
the urban poor (see Ch.3.3.), labour-intensive, state-created
employment may not facilitate the adaptation of the local
labour market to the novel types of jobs generated by new,
growing economic sectors.
A comparison of employment trends with available jobgenerating factors makes the case for dedicated policy
instruments at the city level in order better to distribute the
benefits of prosperity. In close coordination with national
government, dedicated municipal policies have the potential
to provide targeted, context-specific solutions. Short of this,
a city denies residents access to decent jobs and, indirectly,
the right to adequate housing and other public goods and
amenities, which together are fundamental aspects of the
right to the city.

Box 3.1.2: The principles underlying the “Right to the City”
The right to the city calls for a holistic, balanced
and multicultural type of development. This includes mixed neighbourhoods, as opposed to gated
communities for the rich, “city beautification” or renewal schemes which all forcibly relocate the poor
to the urban fringes. Urban working classes, who
build cities and keep them operating smoothly, are
entitled to adequate housing and basic services,
too. Their living conditions must be gradually improved, in situ as far as possible, instead of being
exposed to forced evictions and displacement. The
contribution of the poor to a city’s economy must
be acknowledged and laws should not discriminate
against them in favour of the rich.
The right to the city is a vision for an alternative,
adequate and ideal city. It is not merely the right to
any city, especially not to cities the way we know
them today, but instead one where mutual respect,
tolerance, democracy and social justice prevail. The
right to the city incorporates four major principles.
Indivisibility of Human Rights. The basic principle of the right to city is that human rights are
interdependent and indivisible, i.e., they are to be
realized simultaneously. All human rights – civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental

– must receive equal priority in urban governance,
planning, management and implementation. The
right to the city calls for acknowledgement and
protection of all human rights such as self-determination, freedom of assembly and organization, and
the right to personal and collective development.
Non-discrimination and Inclusion. Rights must
be guaranteed to all those – including women,
youth and children – who choose to make the
city their home, irrespective of economic status,
identity, caste, class, race, gender, religion, sexual
inclination, occupation or civil status, and regardless of whether they are legal residents or formal
“citizens.” Cities must create enabling environments that provide equal access or entitlement to,
and enjoyment of, basic and public services, public
spaces and all kinds of benefits and opportunities
for everyone. Cities must prevent social segregation, gentrification, social apartheid, criminalization of the poor and the homeless, as well as the
increasing “ghettoization” of urban spaces that is
becoming widespread across the world.
Priority to Vulnerable and Marginalized
Groups. The principle of non-discrimination also
calls for special protection of, and priority to, the

rights of the more marginalized groups: women,
the elderly and disabled, slum dwellers, the uneducated, migrants, etc. Cities must cater to the
needs and rights of those belonging to historically
discriminated groups, including through affirmative action where needed (with close monitoring
of outcomes). The right to the city implies a strong
commitment to poverty reduction and the removal
of discriminatory legal and policy provisions.
Gender Equality. The right to the city is also the
right to a “gendered city” ensuring equal protection and realization of women’s human rights.
Women’s participation in city planning and governance is critical to any balanced, equitable urban
development. Municipal authorities must develop
and implement policies in close consultation with
women to ensure they fully benefit from the ”urban advantage” – including health, education,
decent employment, adequate housing, equal
access to both public and private spaces, public
transport, streets, sidewalks, markets, parks, toilets (both public and private), workspaces, political spaces, and community spaces, all in a safe
environment.

Box 3.1.3: Making the Right to the City a Reality: How to Counter Obstacles

Implementing international legal human rights
commitments. This includes the enforcement of
any human rights standards embedded in ratified
legal instruments such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women, the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Outcomes of United Nations conferences,
and other UN resolutions, guidelines and documents should also be adhered to. These include,
inter alia, the Habitat Agenda, the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change and any successor
to the Kyoto Protocol, the Vienna Declaration on human rights and fundamental freedoms, the Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, the
Beijing Declaration on women’s advancement and

Plan of Action, and the Plan of Implementation from
the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
Harmonization of local and national laws with
international human rights standards. Any local and national laws and policies such as those
related to land acquisition, urban master plans,
housing and resettlement must be consistent with
the principles of international human rights law.
On top of this, new legislation that guarantees adequate housing, protection against forced eviction,
and rights to education, health, water and basic
services, should be enacted where needed. International guidelines relevant to urban development
and equitable distribution of resources should also
be incorporated in laws and policies. Government
action must be harmonized, integrating various
tiers and municipal departments to ensure that
public policies and decisions fully comply with recognized human rights.
Need for human rights-based urban reform.
Short of a human rights-based reform of municipal policies, the urban divide cannot be bridged
and the right to the city cannot become effective.
A comprehensive urban land reform agenda must
be developed with participation from government
agencies and civil society. This agenda must detail
the way land use rules, planning, decision making,
budgeting, zoning, housing and equitable access to

financial resources are to be reformed. Municipal
authorities must also collect disaggregated data
on key indicators, with a view to achieving higher
human rights standards and monitoring their own
performance in this respect.
Need for strong municipal political will to
grant human rights and endorse the World
Charter on the Right to the City. In close consultation with civil society, local and municipal authorities should endorse the Charter and all the human
rights set out therein.
Plans and strategies for the simultaneous
realization of rights for all groups, especially
those marginalized. Urban planning should be
participatory, inclusive and representative of a
comprehensive cross-section of interests and social diversity, with special attention for economically weaker and marginalized groups.
Countering the excesses of market forces.
The need here is to prevent or check any unsustainable or artificial inflation of real estate prices
through speculation and the land cartels that make
property and housing prices unaffordable to the
majority. Municipalities must meet the needs of
the economically weaker segments of the population, including through subsidies for access to basic services (particularly where privatized), housing
and public transport.

Taking Forward the right to the city

Taking the right to the city forward is not an easy
task. The current reality is that this right is effective
only for certain segments of society, with the economic and political power that affords those the full
benefits of the “urban advantage”.  Cities all over
the world, and particularly in developing countries,
must take into account the following six critical aspects if they are to guarantee an effective right to
the city for all.

Box 3.1.4: Hidden in the City: Displacement has become an urban phenomenon
Walking through the streets of Amman, Jordan,
one is nearly as likely to pass by a person from
Iraq or the Occupied Territories of Palestine as a
Jordanian. At least 500,000 of Amman’s 2 million residents (see Figure 3.1.2) have come to the
city seeking refuge from conflicts and disasters in
their own countries, making it the world’s number
one urban safe haven. No other city in the world is
known to have taken in such a large number of refugees, yet many Iraqis and Palestinians sheltered
there strive to keep a low profile to avoid detention
or expulsion – risks faced by those who enter the
country illegally, and by those perceived as threats
by authorities striving to maintain security, economic stability and the provision of public services
in an increasingly congested urban environment.
Amman’s education and health care systems have
been particularly burdened by the huge numbers of
refugees who have flocked to the city since 2003,
and most of those also displaced there are jobless.
The issues refugees and city authorities are grappling with in Jordan’s capital are becoming more
and more commonplace around the world, as people displaced from their homes increasingly cross
borders seeking personal security and access to
services in cities. One out of every two refugees,
like a significant proportion of internally displaced

persons (IDPs), now live in an urban area, according to the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR). According to the agency
an estimated 36 per cent of all known refugees,
displaced people, asylum seekers and returnees
combined, or more than 7 million people, resided
in urban areas by the end of 2008.

also displaced tens of thousands of people in Malaysia and Kenya, where Kuala Lumpur and Nairobi have become home to between 30,000 and
46,000 refugees and displaced people. The cities of
Luanda, Kinshasa, Delhi, Panama City, Khartoum,
Kampala and Sana’a all host between 15,000 and
26,000 people of concern to UNHCR.

While 16 per cent of all people displaced to cities
have taken refuge in the developed world, more
than 70 per cent, or 5.3 million, now reside in cities of the developing regions, particularly Western
Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Strong
economies are more capable of absorbing those in
need of special assistance; yet the burden is disproportionately borne by the cities that can least
afford it, often located in conflict-prone regions.

When displaced people move to cities rather than
to rural settlements or dedicated camps, they find
better access to livelihood opportunities and other
urban benefits, including the social networks of
relatives already residing there. However, many
displaced people find themselves facing the same
challenges that already confront millions of poor
urban residents, such as lack of secure tenure,
overcrowded living quarters, and slum conditions,
with poor access to basic services, high insecurity,
unemployment, and significant health risks.

The ongoing conflicts in Southern and Western Asia
have caused huge migration flows in the region.
Baku, Azerbaijan, has become the second-largest
receiver of displaced people after Amman, having
taken in more than 180,000 people as of the end
of 2008. Cairo, too, is a major haven for displaced
persons in the region, with a population of more
than 100,000 refuges and other people seeking assistance from UNHCR, while Kabul and Islamabad
have become home to more than 30,000 displaced
people each. Internal and external conflicts have

As “outsiders,” refugees and displaced people tend
to be more vulnerable to discrimination, violence
and exploitation than their counterparts living in
organized camps. Even inside urban IDP camps
in cities such as Khartoum, however, life remains
precarious. In 2004, more than 80 per cent of
displaced families in the Sudanese capital lived in
temporary shelters made out of plastic and paper,
which were regularly flooded. That same year, the

For refugees in a foreign country, the situation can
be even worse. Those without documents are vulnerable to exploitation by landlords, employers and
others. Without legal status, access to the judiciary comes with the risk of expulsion. The urban
displaced are also among those most likely to be
affected by food crises.

government’s urban planning strategy for Khartoum
led to the demolition of more than 13,000 houses,
schools and health facilities in IDP settlements,
forcibly evicting thousands of families and creating
a homelessness crisis in the city. Between 2003
and 2007, more than 300,000 displaced households in Khartoum became homeless after their
houses were demolished for planning purposes.
Forced relocations have resulted in violence, arrests and deaths of displaced people.

Not all displaced people become part of the visible
urban poor living in slums; a significant proportion is
absorbed into the urban fabric, effectively becoming hidden in the host city. In several countries,
the whereabouts of documented refugees are unknown altogether, making aid and service provision
for them nearly impossible. Avoiding the attention
of authorities comes at the cost of worse housing
and health conditions.

Urban displaced people’s vulnerability is increased
by the legal limbo in which they typically live, including absence of secure housing, land and property
rights. In Colombian cities as in the Somali capital,
Mogadishu, urban warfare forces frequent intra-urban displacement and contributes to slum growth.

UNHCR does not know the whereabouts of all people of concern displaced to cities. Some major host
countries are able to report the urban proportion of
displaced persons within their borders, but not the
specific cities. In the Syrian Arab Republic, for example, UNHCR estimates that the total number of
people of concern living in urban areas exceeds 1.1
million. The population of urban displaced people
in Somalia’s South Central region alone – including
Mogadishu – also exceeds 1 million, though it is
unknown whether all of the displaced people are
living in the capital city. The absorption of refugees
and displaced people into the urban fabric, their
dispersal over large cities and their high mobility
combine to inhibit not just service provision, but
also policymaking and associated research.

Quick Facts	
1.	 Economic inclusion in cities is associated with
different factors in every major developing
region: planning and political will in Africa;
government-induced jobs and legal certainty
in Asia; and democratic institutions and
freedom of the press in Latin America and the
Caribbean.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

2.	 Urban social inclusion is linked with freedom
of expression in Asia; employment, political
progress and free cultural expression in Latin
America and the Caribbean; and multiparty
elections and freedom of expression in Africa.

136

3.	 In Asian and African cities, improvements in
social inclusiveness are closely associated
with the political role of non-governmental
organizations.
4.	 Beyond multiparty elections and freedom of
the press and expression, political inclusion
is driven by other factors in cities, including
freedom of cultural expression and the
empowerment associated with micro-credit.
5.	 In both Asian and African cities, poverty is an
impediment to cultural participation, which in
Latin American cities is favoured by equitable
employment, fiscal incentives and microcredit.
6.	 Government health care programmes
appear to be an effective way of reducing
marginalization and other types of urban
inequality.
7.	 Social infrastructure, such as waste collection,
recreational facilities, public parks and open
spaces, benefits few people in most African
cities, where public transport is a very effective
way of reducing inequalities.

he previous chapter has analysed the “Right
to the City”, highlighting its potential as a
general template for municipal efforts to bridge
the urban divide and pave the way for more
inclusive cities, and reviewing the challenges that face rightsbased approaches in general. Such approaches take in the four
dimensions of urban exclusion or inclusion, as well as their
various linkages. This chapter highlights the diverse, specific
dynamic interactions between these political, economic, social
and cultural dimensions in the world’s three major developing
regions, as perceived by the local experts who participated in
the UN-HABITAT policy analysis in 27 representative cities.
If planners, municipal officials and other stakeholders are
to recognize the urban divide in all its four dimensions and
facilitate a prompt and sustainable transition from a partially
to a completely inclusive city, then they must build upon the
existing strengths that together represent the specific “urban
advantage” of their own cities. Just like the factors behind
the urban divide, these specific strengths can be of a social,
economic, cultural or political nature. It is for policymakers to
identify those strengths in a comprehensive assessment of local
assets in order to collect all the information they need to make
progress toward broad-based inclusiveness. Such an assessment
should include the operational and practical resources, both
formal and informal, which the various stakeholders can
contribute to achieve the redistributive change required to
bridge the urban divide. At the same time, there can be no
hiding that this endeavour is likely to run up against at least one
of three major institutional and political challenges: (1) local
authorities may not be committed to reducing inequality; (2)
the three tiers of government (national, provincial and local)
may be poorly coordinated, if at all; and (3) local and central
authorities may lack an overall strategic vision, including on
the best ways of closing the urban divide.
The four dimensions of the urban divide – social,
economic, political and cultural – are frequently found
to overlap. The linkages among the four dimensions are of
a substantive though so far ill-defined nature. The findings
of the UN-HABITAT survey of 27 cities featured here are
significant because they make it possible to shed light on
some of the inter-relationships at work in urban centres in the
three major developing regions of the world. Among other
findings, the survey shows that any government committed

to promoting inclusiveness should act in a proactive way on
all these dimensions, since they are linked together. Analysis
of the survey results has identified a number of dynamic
associations among them which municipal and other public
authorities can use as guidelines in their own efforts to foster
more inclusive cities.

Economic inclusion and its links to
social and political inclusion

In the three subsections below, “Africa”, “Asia”, “Latin America
and the Caribbean” refer to the relevant cities under review.
Africa: Economic inclusion is associated with planning
and political will

Policy Points	
1.	 Africa’s national, local and municipal
authorities must improve coordination of their
planning and implementation functions if the
urban divide is to be narrowed across the
continent.
2.	 A healthy, well-educated population is a
major asset for any city, and knowledge is a
prerequisite for enhanced civic participation in
the social, political and cultural spheres.
3.	 Bridging the social divide in Asia will
require greater collaboration between
non-governmental organizations and poor
communities, with advocacy organizations
playing an even more proactive role in the
political sphere, as is already the case in Latin
American cities.
4.	 The empirical link between democratic
governance and social inclusion highlights
the need for institutions and enforcement
mechanisms favouring participatory decisionmaking, while guaranteeing effective free
speech and freedom of the press.
5.	 Cities should encourage anything that can
foster multiple and complementary identities
in order to reduce any polarization among
groups, particularly in a multi-cultural, multilinguistic, multi-ethnic type of society.
6.	 Recognition of cultural diversity entails the
deployment of spaces and conditions that
favour various forms of active participation, in
accordance with the different societal, cultural
and organizational forms that characterize any
specific population.

The regional dynamics of inclusion

The survey results from the seven African cities under review
suggest that any economic inclusiveness they have to offer is
associated with two elements: (1) the degree of coordination
(where any) among the planning functions of local, provincial
and national government, (2) the active involvement of nongovernmental organizations calling for stronger political will
and advocating freedom of expression and other human rights.
Whereas in several Asian and Latin American cities, economic
dynamism is under strong influence from recent structural
changes such as the rise of banking and telecommunications
services, this phenomenon is not so prevalent in the seven
African cities included in the UN-HABITAT survey. Except
for Mombasa and Ibadan, these cities are national capitals
where government is a major provider of jobs. Though
not a capital, Ibadan is a university town and, as such, to
a large extent also relies on the public sector for formal job
opportunities. Still, even in Ibadan, as in Accra and (at least
partially) in Abuja, the predominant source of opportunities
for formal employment has shifted from the civil service to the
private sector, where (as in some Latin American and Asian
cities) banks and telecommunications companies provide
both skilled and semi-skilled jobs.1
In the African cities under review, the apparent association
between civil society advocacy in favour of the poor and
economic inclusiveness comes in response to the extensive
rent-seeking and dominance of rich people and politicians
in urban economies. On top of calling for government
action and militating for human rights, non-governmental

Regardless of the achievements of individual cities as hubs
of prosperity, genuinely inclusive economic progress leading
to an equitable allocation of opportunities and income is, to a
very large extent, determined by the specific political, cultural
and social equality parameters of any given city. As reviewed
below, the findings from 27 cities in three developing regions
surveyed – Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean
– unanimously corroborate the dynamic inter-relationships
between economic inclusion on the one hand, and political
and cultural equality in cities on the other hand.

Box 3.2.1: Main features of the 27-city survey
The concept of the “inclusive city” provided
the rationale for the questionnaire at the core
of the UN-HABITAT survey and policy analysis.
As defined in this Report, an “inclusive city” is
one that, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or
socio-economic status provides all residents with
adequate housing and decent basic services, facilitating equal access to social amenities and
public goods that are essential to promote the
general and environmental well-being of everyone (social inclusion). An inclusive city protects
citizens’ rights and freedom, and promotes social

and political participation that contributes to relevant and democratic decision-making (political
inclusion). An inclusive city fosters economic
development by way of equal opportunities for
business and access to employment, promoting
pro-poor economic policies (economic inclusion).
An inclusive city promotes social integration and
celebrates diversity. It values people’s cultural
rights, recognizing the human capital of all segments of society, and strives to enhance them
by promoting creative expression in the arts and
heritage activities (cultural inclusion).

The questionnaire captured all these dimensions
succinctly, along with the institutional and organizational issues that are critical to effective
equality and equity in cities. The questionnaire
submitted to some 400 experts on three continents covered the following:
(1) General information; (2) inclusion and inequality in the relevant city: general issues; (3) economic equality and inclusion; (4) social equality
and inclusion; (5) political equality and access;
(6) cultural equality and expression; (7) additional
information.

organizations look to mobilize urban communities in
favour of accountability. In many African cities, the private
sector is largely controlled by the political and economic
elites, and human rights advocacy is to be interpreted as
calls to democratize the business sector in order to open
opportunities to all. Survey responses from a majority of
African cities confirmed that the benefits of prosperity were
unequally shared across various social segments. A large
number of respondents felt that in the seven cities, current
efforts to generate employment opportunities fell well short of
providing hope to those who are economically marginalized.
Therefore, in the African cities under review, poor
government management of the economic sphere seems to
come as an outgrowth of weak institutions and inadequate
regulatory frameworks; these, in turn, incite greater civil
society involvement on behalf of the poorer and marginalized
segments of the local population. This finding highlights
the important (though hitherto largely ignored) role of
social and political inclusiveness when it comes to fostering
economic inclusiveness and harmony in cities. In such
circumstances, civil society adds an economic function to
its more conventional political and social roles; to put it
in economic terms, transaction costs are reduced for local

communities when organized civil society steps in to enhance
grassroots awareness of economic rights and opportunities,
and to bypass formal institutional arrangements for easier
delivery of services at relatively low cost.2 However, in some
circumstances, bypassing formal institutional arrangements
can result in parallel structures that weaken the role of public
authorities, which in turn can jeopardize government capacity
for adaptation and delivery in the long run.
This apparent linkage between the economy on the one
hand, and social and political activism on the other, provides
much-needed evidence in support of the call for a more
holistic, multi-dimensional approach to an inclusive city.
Asia: Economic inclusion is linked to government-induced
jobs and legal certainty
In Asia, responses from the experts in the selected 10
cities suggest that government-induced employment
(through infrastructure development, for example) is
strongly associated with economic inclusiveness, together
with fiscal incentives to business and sound contractual and
legal frameworks. This supports the earlier findings by UNHABITAT that urban growth is largely determined by macro-

economic and industrial policies as well as by infrastructural
development.3 In Delhi, Jaipur and Mumbai, more than
half the survey respondents concurred that governmentinduced employment was a very effective way of addressing
inequalities of income and opportunities.

of their respective cities was not well apportioned among the
various social segments. For all this quasi-unanimity, though,
respondents could not agree on which particular groups were
the main beneficiaries of formal income-generating activities
and employment opportunities.

The survey also suggests that in the 10 Asian cities under
review, freedom of expression is also strongly associated with
economic inclusion. While this may seem surprising at first
glance, Asia’s changing employment patterns support this
finding. A gradual transition from manufacturing to services
and high technology (information and communication,
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and electronics) has only
been made possible through the availability of technically
qualified and highly skilled workers. Subsequent economic
prosperity has been characterized by increases in incomes and,
concomitantly, an expanding middle class (especially in India).
This socioeconomic transformation has been accompanied by
greater demands not just for improved social and economic
conditions, but also for transparency and accountability.4

Furthermore, although a majority of respondents reckoned
that their respective cities were addressing inequalities of
income and opportunities through specific programmes and
policy initiatives, they were of the view that only two types
of policies – government-induced creation of specific forms
of employment, and micro-credit – were the most effective
mechanisms in this regard. Other measures such as vocational
training to enable skills development, streamlined procedures
for improved access to employment and new rules to promote
jobs, were considered to be rather ineffective, as were fiscal
incentives. The poor results of public authorities’ efforts to
curb inequality in Latin American and Caribbean cities can be
largely explained by lack of political will among government
officials, poorly focused programmes and, to a lesser extent,
inadequate civic participation.

The powerful apparent linkage between economic
inclusiveness and freedom of expression corroborates the
theory of cultural change, which poses that the more a society
becomes industrialized and reliant on skilled work and
technology, the more chances that the concomitant shift in
values will in turn bring new societal changes, including more
democratic politics.5
Latin America and the Caribbean: Economic inclusion
is associated with democratic institutions and freedom
of the press

As mentioned earlier, Africa’s national, local and municipal
authorities must improve coordination of their planning and
implementation functions if the urban divide is to be narrowed
across the continent. Survey findings strongly suggest that the
existing, rather moderate degree of planning coordination
among the three tiers of government is not matched when
it comes to implementation. This largely inhibits municipal
authorities’ ability to respond to the needs of the population.
In resource-poor environments such as those prevalent in
the three regions reviewed in the UN-HABITAT survey,
local authorities rely on funding and technical support from
state/provincial and central budgets to design and implement
municipal programmes. In such circumstances, any lack of
coordinated implementation signals a significant lapse in the
way institutions operate, and one that must be rectified.
Coordination at all levels of government is critical to
bridging the social divide
While most Latin American and, to some extent, Asian
cities under review appear to enjoy better coordination
among national, state and local authorities, most of the seven
African cities were found lacking on this count. Still, the
few exceptions identified by respondent experts are worth
mentioning. In Johannesburg, for instance, city leaders
have undertaken effectively to grant the specific social and
economic rights detailed in South Africa’s 1996 Bill of
Rights, going beyond mere declarations of principles and
establishing better coordination among national, regional
and local authorities. The primary purpose was to address
any backlogs in the provision of basic services, and to
extend access to water, sanitation and electricity to the entire

The regional dynamics of inclusion

In the 10 Latin American and Caribbean cities under review,
multiparty democracy and freedom of the press seem to be
strongly associated with economic inclusiveness. For all the
significant strides democratic governance has been making
in the region generally, the survey suggests that political
institutions, rule of law and accountability do not always
work properly; to put it another way, they still fall short of
the expectations of urban populations.6 Therefore, reform of
government institutions, modernized public policies and novel
forms of participation (particularly those related to freedom of
the press and multiparty elections) are of crucial importance
if poor economic performance is to be improved. In Latin
America as in Africa, the strong association between economic
inclusiveness and advocacy for democratic rights can be seen
as an effort to tackle rent-seeking and curb the formation of
interest group coalitions that could restrict economic benefits
and opportunities to only a few specific segments of society.
Political calls to amend dysfunctional social and economic
institutions are echoed in survey respondents’ perceptions
that in Latin American cities, urban policies, reforms and
decisions benefit the rich by up to three times as much as they
do slum dwellers and the poor. In Bogotá, Callao, Cartago,
Curitiba, Oruro and São Paulo, more than 90 per cent of
the experts surveyed concurred that the economic prosperity

population. The Johannesburg municipality also launched an
“Expanded Public Works Programme” to promote labourintensive infrastructure construction funded by national and
local budgets. The scheme enabled the city to create more
than 1 million jobs in 2007 and 2008, an increase of no less
than 546 per cent over the 2004/05 fiscal year.7 Similarly, in
Accra, effective coordination of efforts and resources between
central and local authorities has made it possible to extend
the benefits of Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme to
the bulk of the population, enabling local hospitals to extend
treatment to the poor and vulnerable in the country’s capital.
In contrast to Johannesburg and Accra, most of the other
African cities under review were found deficient in terms of
social inclusion mechanisms or proper integrated programmes
and policies aimed at reducing inequality and service
inadequacies. In addition to basic services such as water and
sanitation, the types of social infrastructure most lacking
in African cities include waste collection and recreational
facilities, public parks and open spaces. Survey respondents
concurred that such amenities did not benefit the large
majority of the population in their respective cities. Waste
collection is also a severely neglected agenda in a number
of African cities. Here again, though, Accra stands out as a
significant exception, with provision by private companies
subject to scrutiny and supervision by public agencies.
Improvements are also expected in Johannesburg, owing to
substantial increases in budget allocations for waste removal
in the 2009/10 municipal budget. Along with other cities
under review, South Africa’s economic capital clearly makes
the case for city-specific or municipal approaches to resource
mobilization that are based on improved coordination among
all three tiers of government.

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Health care is the most effective bridge over the
social divide

140

The survey clearly suggests that government health care
programmes are one of the most effective ways of reducing
marginalization and other types of inequality that are
detrimental to the more vulnerable urban dwellers. This is
particularly the case in Ibadan, where municipal authorities
are working closely with federal and state health care services
to establish Primary Health Centres that include clinics,
hospitals and dispensaries in various areas. The facilities
provide prevention and treatment and are also involved in
research and collection of statistics.8 Likewise, in Accra, the
three tiers of government are establishing clinics in most
communities and suburbs in a concerted effort to extend
provision of health services to all neighbourhoods. In both
Ibadan and Accra, survey respondents concurred that health
care programmes made a highly effective contribution to
narrowing the urban divide. These findings also highlight
a major policy dimension: the focus on health is necessary
and important per se in African cities, but also comes in
response to the Millennium Development Goals. It is worth

remembering here that some of these goals call for significant
efforts with regard to education. As the signatories of the
Millennium Declaration agreed in the year 2000, a healthy,
well-educated population is a major asset for any city, and
knowledge is a prerequisite for enhanced civic participation
in the social, political and cultural spheres.
Public transport reduces social inequalities in
African cities
Public transport features as the second most effective way of
reducing inequalities in African cities, UN-HABITAT survey
respondents suggest. This is important since nearly two-thirds
of responses show that in Africa the average commute by
public transport from residence to workplace exceeds one hour.
Again, Johannesburg and Accra stand out for good, egalitarian
practice. In Johannesburg, the municipality has upgraded the
existing rail system and introduced a new Bus Rapid Transit
service to improve access to the city’s resources and services.
The subsidized bus network does not just extend to poor
peripheral residential areas that were inadequately served
before: it also connects them, crucially, both to workplaces and
vocational training centres.9 In Accra, the Metro Mass Transit
service has been improved with more connections both within
the city and between the city and other urban centres, which
facilitates affordable movement of people in various parts of
the Ghanaian capital and the hinterland.
Asia: Social inclusiveness is linked with freedom
of expression
In the 10 Asian cities under review, survey results suggest
that improvements in social inclusiveness are closely associated
with the political role of non-governmental organizations
advocating stronger political commitment by government,
along with freedom of expression and other human rights.
This finding confirms the view that as non-governmental
organizations extend their work to grassroots empowerment
and capacity-building, the poor become more involved in
politics. 10 For example, in India, health, education and other
social welfare functions have been granted constitutional
status (either as a fundamental right or as a “directive principle
for state policy”) largely as a result of civil society campaigns.
In Asia, non-governmental organizations have not just
grown rapidly in numbers over the last 30 years. Their
scope, in terms of sectors and population, has also expanded
significantly. Today they are active in many areas including
health, education, housing, basic service delivery, micro-credit,
advocacy, empowerment and capacity-building. However, the
strong link found between the degree of social inclusiveness
and civil society’s political activism in the Asian cities under
review clearly suggests that these organizations should play an
even more proactive role in the political sphere; they could,
for instance, encourage the citizenry to regroup and put
public authorities under more pressure, as is already the case

in Latin American cities. Clearly, Asian non-governmental
organizations must move beyond the conventional framework
under which they have been operating so far. It is incumbent
on them to explore new frontiers if they are to support the
institutional strengthening required to promote equality,
political rights and civil liberties.11 This is essential for any
bridging of the social divide.
Asian cities have experienced general improvements in
housing and access to basic services, including electric power,
telephone and cable facilities. Still, UN-HABITAT survey
findings point to huge disparities in service provision between
rich and poor. This is particularly true with regard to sewage
disposal and waste collection, where the gap in access creates
a visible distinction between the “haves” and the “have nots”.
In Bangladesh, more than 80 per cent of survey respondents
in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong rated sewage disposal and
waste collection as either “not provided at all” or “poorly
provided”. Dhaka, in particular, stands out for extensive land
grabbing by a group of unscrupulous real estate companies
and powerful local political leaders. As a result, the number
of public spaces – parks, lakes, riversides, canals, playgrounds,

graveyards and cremation grounds – has been decreasing. At
the same time, development of private spaces such as country
clubs, gymnasiums and amusement parks is booming, for the
sole enjoyment of privileged groups. The net effect of these
parallel developments is to reduce access to social amenities
for the majority of the Dhaka population.12
Conditions in Asia are echoed in comments from survey
respondents in African cities, where local experts were of the
view that poor access, if any, to recreational facilities, public
parks and free spaces for social activity ranked among the
deficiencies in social infrastructure that contribute to the
urban divide.
An analysis of the results across the 27 cities under review
clearly suggests that lack of inclusive development policies
is the main causal factor restricting the rights, opportunities
and aspirations of the relatively weaker segments of society
– the urban poor, women, children, the disabled, foreign
immigrants, and some ethnic and religious minorities.
Those who are also slum dwellers appear to be even more
marginalized, with one-third of respondents rating them as
specifically excluded and vulnerable (see Chapter 3.1).

and economically excluded groups in the two countries.14
However, in some Asian centralized economic and political
regimes, NGOs are likely to be operating in tandem with
government interests, despite their rhetorical support of free
expression of civil society and respect for human rights.
Latin America: Social inclusiveness through jobs, political
progress and free cultural expression
In the 10 Latin American and Caribbean cities under
review, survey results suggest that social inclusion is strongly
associated with several policy variables, particularly in three
areas: change in existing rules to promote employment,
improvements in political governance, and freedom of
cultural expression.
It comes as no surprise that employment promotion through
regulatory changes should be strongly linked with social
inclusiveness in a region characterized by high unemployment
in the formal economy and poorly paid jobs in the informal

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

UN-HABITAT survey results point to the main fault in
municipal social integration programmes, namely, their
poor focus, or altogether absence thereof. Another, related
deficiency is lack of monitoring and evaluation of city
performance, with lack of political will ranking third among
the causes of inefficiency.
This is where non-governmental organizations can play a
complementary, supportive political role in social inclusion,
as some are already demonstrating: they promote an inclusive concept of the public interest, advocate for monitoring
of programmes and policies, as well as for improved decisionmaking and more focused policies that specifically target the
underprivileged. In India, for instance, organized civil society
and women’s groups are pushing political parties into mainstreaming women’s concerns in their platforms. In Thailand,
civil society organizations call for the inculcation of trust in
political and social institutions.13 In India and Bangladesh,
non-governmental organizations stand for the human rights
of the Dalit community, one of the most politically, socially

sector. Any rare new formal job is either for the highly skilled
and well-paid, or the unskilled and low-paid, and a majority of
the Latin American and Caribbean population falls in between
these two categories. The experts answering the survey were of
the view that an enabling, efficient legal framework would
stimulate formal job creation and, as such, was an essential
pre-requisite for social and economic inclusion. As suggested
earlier in this Report, lack of income results in inadequate
housing and minimum basic services, as well as poor access
to the proper health, education and other social benefits that
cities normally have to offer.
Against the background of the economic crisis and related
massive layoffs, the UN Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean and the International Labour
Organization have estimated that over the course of 2009,
some 2.5 million people would become unemployed, or a
1 per cent increase (to 8.5 per cent) in the unemployment
rate worldwide.15 Although this projection makes the general
prospects for more social and economic inclusion rather more
dubious, protecting the population from such shocks remains
a government prerogative. As an expert from Quito remarked:
“A poor job or lack thereof interferes with the possibility of a
full exercise of the right to the city, as it results in an absence
not just of economic, but also social inclusion”.16
Further empirical evidence from previous UN-HABITAT
surveys and background documents shows that advancements
in political governance are significantly associated with
social inclusion, and particularly legal assistance, freedom of
expression, freedom of the press and multiparty elections.

The empirical link between democratic governance and
social inclusion highlights the need for institutions and
enforcement mechanisms that can bring more inclusiveness in
decision-making, while guaranteeing effective free speech and
freedom of the press. These are the basic social and political
conditions enabling communities to raise their voice, and to
ensure that their demands are heard and mainstreamed both
in legal frameworks and policy decisions. More institutional
engagement from organized civil society seems to be an
essential prerequisite for any pro-poor transformation and,
more specifically, for effective social integration programmes.
Failure to provide these, experts stress, reflects a “lack of
political will” among governments, which, alongside “lack
of appropriate focus of city programmes”, is the main factor
behind poor social inclusion in the 10 cities under review in
Latin America and the Caribbean.
The UN-HABITAT survey also suggests that freedom
of cultural expression is strongly associated with social
inclusion. It is worth noting here that several cities promote
culture as a means to achieve social inclusion. This is the
case in Bogotá, where culture builds collective identity and
conviviality as an antidote to violence (the dominant conflict
resolution mechanism), illustrating its potential role in social
transformation.19 Uruguay is another case in point, with
national and local authorities promoting cultural debate
in a bid to instill a sense of democratic dignity, plurality,
collective advancement and learning as a cornerstone of
social inclusion.20

Political inclusiveness and democratic
governance
In the two subsections below, “Africa” and “Latin America and
the Caribbean” refer to the relevant cities under review.
Africa: Political inclusion through multiparty elections
and freedom of expression
It comes as no surprise that freedom of expression and the
press, multiparty elections and a constitutional guarantee of
cultural expression were all found to be positively linked to
political inclusiveness in the seven African cities under review
– even though these components of democratic politics are at
different stages of advancement across countries, and making
relatively slow progress overall.
For all the formal recognition that civil and political rights
are constitutional rights, implementation is poor on average,
if not extremely scarce. In many African cities, though, some
aspects of democracy such as proper election standards, viability
of basic democratic institutions such as courts and legislatures,
and social participation are becoming more dominant in the
political discourse. It is also clear that over the past few decades,

The regional dynamics of inclusion

Over the past three decades, Latin America and the
Caribbean has made enormous progress in democratic
governance, including in crucial areas like central government
reform (decentralization, better use of institutions), social
participation and democratic turnover of ruling parties and
politicians. This is why, of all developing regions, Latin
America today stands at the forefront for participatory
process and female political representation.17 In a number
of cities, such progress has mainly come under the form of
institutional strengthening and participatory budgeting.
These have enhanced links between democratic governance
and human rights in many cities and countries. Although
civic rights appear to be secured in cities such as Bogotá, São
Paulo, Callao and Quito, according to experts only three
specific groups really seem to benefit from urban reforms,
namely, civil servants, the wealthy and high-ranking officials.
This is particularly true with regard to access to legal counsel
and the courts. In Port-au-Prince, for instance, a single court
is in charge of settling disputes and issuing birth, death and
marriage certificates for 400,000 residents in one of the poorest
neighborhoods, known as “Cité Soleil”.18 Where cities fail to
deploy institutions and procedures that are more responsive to
the needs of ordinary people (including the poor), exclusion
and social inequality will continue to interfere with effective
basic rights and liberties for everyone – a phenomenon that
can pose threats to social and political stability.

Democratic governance and social inclusion
are inter-related

demands for more local “voice” and involvement in decisions
that affect living conditions have become more pressing. In
general terms, though, urban residents remain sharply critical
of municipal governance and management. Experts in cities
as diverse as Nairobi, Ibadan, Dakar, Abuja and Mombasa
concurred that local communities were neither coordinated
nor sufficiently empowered to make effective demands on
municipal institutions.21 They were of the view that political
guarantees like access to legal assistance and aid, along with
civil society advocacy of political will, freedom of expression
and human rights, were hardly or only moderately effective as
they stood.

144

As an expert in Abuja stated, “the city is dominated by the
politics of the rich and godfatherism”, pointing to rampant
political patronage.22 In Ibadan, high-quality residential
areas are host to the political class who enjoy what one of
the local experts called the “dividends of democracy”, such
as proper infrastructure, employment opportunities and
social services.23 Another expert found that in Nairobi,
“the municipal leadership does not generally promote civil
participation or create accountability frameworks for overall
municipal management”.24
UN-HABITAT survey results suggest that those public
administrations in charge of the welfare of urban populations
lack both transparency and accountability. Experts rated as
“very poor” the performance of these administrations. Even
in Nairobi and Mombasa, and as in Ibadan, none of the
experts reckoned that municipal officials were accountable
or “transparent”. They said corruption (as defined by lack
or thorough, regular, independent audits and transparent
accounting systems) was a major reason for these failures.
The other factors behind poor municipal performance
identified through the survey included inefficient and
ineffective administrative systems and, to a lesser extent,
discriminatory mechanisms that are particularly detrimental
to the poor. In Africa, an overwhelming majority of expert
opinion concurred that these practices were “facilitated”
and exacerbated by lack of easy access to information, and
whatever information available, even if limited, was typically
found in the press.

Poor accountability and transparency allows some
individuals, organizations and companies to secure significant
economic gains without reciprocating any benefits back to
society.25 Experts have identified three special-interest groups
as the beneficiaries of urbanization policies and related policy
reforms: politicians, civil servants and the urban rich –
whereas the urban poor and slum dwellers are systematically
marginalized and rarely benefit from these policies.
Still, the UN-HABITAT survey has identified instances of
more responsive public administrations. Ghana and Liberia
have substantially enhanced civic participation in government
selection, as well as freedom of expression, association and the
media.26 Rwanda has made progress in “strengthening local
government structures as cornerstones of its post-conflict
recovery strategy”.27 As far as individual cities are concerned,
Durban and Johannesburg are worthy of note, with innovative
governance mechanisms that facilitate participatory
approaches. In eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality (which
includes Durban), an efficient collective system of governance
involves an executive mayor, sub-councils and wards.
“Bridge City Thinking” is a pioneering programme that
addresses residential differentiation and aims to link different
communities across the whole municipal territory. Both
Durban and Johannesburg have substantially enhanced public
participation in municipal budgeting and accountability. In
this respect, Johannesburg was rated as the most effective
African city by the experts involved in the UN-HABITAT
survey. This top regional rating remains relatively low by
comparison with other regions; however, if Johannesburg
were to adopt its proposed “City Accountability Programme”,
more indicators of city governance would become available
with regard not just to budget revenues and expenditures,
but also the tangible results of the city’s efforts to promote
democracy and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the
Johannesburg municipality has already put in place an annual
“satisfaction survey” enabling households and the business
community to assess the effectiveness of city communication,
performance of wards and community-based planning.
Although the resulting “satisfaction index” has slightly fallen
in the last two years, the municipality continues to compile
the numbers and to disseminate the results.

poor social participation may also include the decreasing
role played by conventional political parties and the weak
legitimacy of the institutions in charge of elections.
For all these widespread shortcomings, though, the
political process is looking very encouraging in a number
of cities and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean,
as it is beginning to usher in a more positive political and
institutional environment. For instance, municipal officials
and politicians have gained a deeper understanding of
the conditions in informal neighbourhoods and are more
committed to improve these, as illustrated by regional trends
showing that more than 32 million people in the region are
no longer considered “slum dwellers” (see Chapter 1.3).
Positive change is also making itself felt in areas like
institutional strengthening, participatory budgeting and other
participation procedures, along with greater efficiency in
public capital investment, sounder administrative procedures
and enhanced accountability. New forums for cross-sector
coordination between social-oriented organizations and local
and national governments have been created in many cities.
Concerns for civic and human rights are more and more
apparent in urban life. As an expert in São Paulo remarked,
“social movements and organizations that support and
guarantee the enforceability of rights consider that talk about
“rights” effectively refers to the right to the city”.31
Together with these more positive developments, municipal
management and political participation in Latin America and
the Caribbean have some instances of best practice to offer.
In Curitiba, novel forms of civic participation are developed
through the Ruas da Cidadania (“streets of citizenship”)
scheme. In these areas, residents contribute their views and
practical ideas in a collective effort to improve access to
municipal public services. In Oruro, a new “Dialogue Law”
supports the political participation and inclusion of all
citizens. In Port-au-Prince, the water supply and sanitation
sector has been reformed by law, and network management
has become participatory through so-called “Local Water
Committees”. In Quito, city authorities have established
an autonomous commission (known as “Quito Honesto”) to
fight corruption in municipalities. In Portoviejo, integral
management of risks in slum settlements is a major project.
In São Paulo as in other Brazilian and, more generally, Latin
American cities, participatory democracy and budgeting are
becoming integral to municipal management. If anything,
these instances of best practice demonstrate the close links
among political inclusiveness, democratic governance and the
full exercise of civic and political rights.
Promoting cultural expression matters for
political inclusion
The social and ethnic diversity that characterizes cities in
both Africa and Latin America is probably behind the UNHABITAT survey finding that when municipalities formally
(i.e., by law) promote cultural expression, they also contribute
to political inclusion. The survey has identified many

municipal initiatives aimed at promoting cultural inclusion
through specific events and facilities, including presentations,
exhibitions and workshops in those areas where they would
otherwise be unavailable. In this respect and as mentioned
earlier, Bogotá has enacted its own “Declaration of Cultural
Rights” in a bid to enhance equal opportunities for cultural
expression by all segments of the population; this came as
part of a broader-ranging effort to promote cultural diversity
and more equitable appropriation of the city’s cultural riches
and heritage.
Micro-credit promotes political inclusion through
knowledge and networking
In Latin America and the Caribbean, the UN-HABITAT
survey has uncovered a positive, significant if rather indirect
association between micro-credit and political inclusion. The
causal link, which involves human capital, works as follows:
on top of mobilizing the productive capacities of the poor,
micro-credit also links those involved with other economic
agents, disseminating local knowledge through networks –
and contributing to the recognition of their associations as
social, economic and political stakeholders to interact with.
The Quito municipality supports micro-credit through a
dedicated organization called AGRUPAR (for Agricultura
Urbana Participativa), which promotes community urban
agriculture and other forms of alternative business, in the
process providing a degree of official recognition to all the
beneficiaries. The municipality of São Paulo also provides
micro-credit under its own entrepreneurship support
programme, on top of facilitating access to loans for the poor
through its “Solidarity Credit Programme”.
Using culture as a tool for social, economic and
political inclusion
A culturally inclusive city celebrates diversity while
promoting the social integration of groups that are
characterized by different cultural backgrounds and
expressions, including ethnicity, language, religion, historic
origins, values and beliefs. In most cities of the developing
world, recognition and promotion of cultural inclusiveness are
entrenched in municipal as well as fundamental and national
legal frameworks. Still, as UNESCO stated in its World
Culture Report (2000), “Cultural diversity [is] a descriptive
feature of our contemporary world; [it] is a point of departure.
Diversity fosters creativity, as demonstrated in the ability of
human groups to adapt and transform their living conditions.
(However,) as the developing world stands today, diversity and
creativity are caught in the cage of inequality and injustice”.32
Indeed, another finding of UN-HABITAT policy analysis
is that cultural diversity and inclusiveness are challenged by
similar factors in cities as diverse as Buenos Aires, Port-auPrince, Chittagong, Abuja and Mombasa. In the developing
world, cultural facilities in slums and low-income urban areas
can be scarce (if at all available), underused or dilapidated,

Cultural inclusiveness involves a dynamic process
of engagement
UN-HABITAT survey results suggest that in a majority of
the cities under review, the local ethnic group languages most
spoken by the population are not used in official dealings,
on signs or public information boards. Nevertheless, it
must be recognized that cities enable some forms of cultural
rights and expressions, and they do so through three main
channels: (1) ad hoc provision of shared spaces for cultural
events; (2) promotion of intercultural programmes; and (3)
the protection and celebration of specific monuments and
buildings that are part of the architectural heritage. In most
cases, though, the rationale behind such cultural expression

and heritage preservation is to impose predetermined values
and single, one-way meanings on places and narratives
that reflect only the history of the country’s or city’s ethnic
majorities and oligarchies. Consequently, these biased
forms of cultural expression hardly have any relevance to
the social, cultural and ethnic diversity that is a feature of
the contemporary city; various groups fail to recognize
themselves in that particular history or local identity,
adding to their sense of systematic exclusion.33 The cities
of Dhaka, Chittagong and Rajshahi, in Bangladesh, are a
case in point: the cultural dominance of Bengali Muslims
(the majority demographic group) and, to a lesser extent,
of Bengali Hindus, stands in the way of official recognition
of the cultural rights of minority groups.34 In India, some
cities had at some point managed to become cohesive despite
their diversity, but today are “facing a grave challenge to
[the country’s] constitutional commitment to multiple and
complementary identities with the rise of groups that seek to
impose a singular Hindu identity on the country”.35
Freedom of expression is strongly linked with
cultural inclusion
It may not be so surprising that those groups that find
themselves systematically excluded when it comes to
expressing their cultural identity or accessing opportunities
for cultural integration are the same in Africa, Asia or Latin
America and the Caribbean – namely the disabled, the elderly
and young people, as well as, with some variations, either
uneducated people or foreign immigrants. Somewhat more
surprising is the fact that in all these regions, slum dwellers

and ill-adjusted to local demand. In contrast, most cultural
facilities are located in more affluent neighbourhoods. This is
not surprising, since those struggling day after day to secure
tenure on their homes, livelihoods and other basic necessities
are not in a position to participate in events and achieve their
cultural potential. Inequitable distribution of amenities is
only one aspect of cultural exclusion, though; another has
to do with inequitable access to technology and information,
which further undermines the capacities of the poor to take
advantage of modern-day cultural and other opportunities
for self-development. In many of the cities reviewed in the
UN-HABITAT survey, cultural events are restricted to those
with adequate purchasing power, even where such events
are subsidized by public authorities. On the other hand,
popular and alternative arts, musical and cultural events are
often marginalized, or simply not promoted or funded by
municipal authorities.

appear as the third most excluded group. Comments from
local experts are unambiguous, though:

Historically entrenched inequalities in regions affect
cultural inclusion in cities

•	 “A person that is poor economically will very often be poor
socially and culturally, too” (Quito).36

The Asian and, to a lesser extent, Latin American cities in
the survey are located in countries with predominant cultures
where minorities remain marginalized. This is why, in Asian
cities, freedom of expression and promotion of cultural
expression at the municipal level are strongly associated with
cultural inclusiveness. This situation points to historically
entrenched inequalities in the region and their persistence
across generations. However, in Latin America dominance by
a majority culture is mitigated by two types of factors: some
are of a general kind, namely, economic incentives, which
represent serious attempts to even out access to culture; other
factors are more specific to the region, such as the greater
emphasis on participatory approaches that characterizes the
Latin American cities in the survey.
Those cities and countries that manage to mitigate cultural
exclusion clearly demonstrate the need for multi-dimensional
responses. These combine effective access to education,
the judiciary and other public and private services, such as
culture, sports and leisure activities and amenities.39 Cities
should also encourage anything that can foster multiple and
complementary identities in order to reduce any polarization
between groups, particularly in a multi-cultural, multilinguistic, multi-ethnic type of society.40 Recognition of
cultural diversity entails the deployment of spaces and

•	 “Ethnic minorities rank, generally speaking, in the
same category as the common poor and disempowered”
(Dhaka).37
•	 “Cultural inclusion is linked to the economic well-being of
a community, and since the poor are excluded economically,
their degrees of social, political and cultural inclusion are
low as well” (Rajshahi).38
These findings make it easier to understand why survey
respondents, here again, perceived freedom of expression as
strongly linked to the promotion of cultural inclusiveness,
not just in Asia but in the African cities under review as
well. These results call attention to a very important issue: in
both Asian and African cities, poverty is the most significant
impediment to cultural participation, which only very few
institutions are in a position to promote. In contrast, in the
Latin American and Caribbean cities under review, cultural
inclusiveness is positively correlated with laws that promote
equitable employment, as well as with fiscal incentives,
micro-credit and formal municipal promotion of cultural
inclusion.

Box 3.2.2: How the four
dimensions of urban equality
are inter-linked
The 2009 UN-HABITAT policy analysis on the inclusive
city suggests that the four dimensions of urban inclusion are each associated with a set of well-defined if
diverse factors which municipal and other public authorities can activate simultaneously in order to bridge the
urban divide.
Economic inclusiveness was found to be positively
linked with (in descending order) (1) coordination and
planning at all levels of government; (2) promotion of
political will, free expression and other human rights
by organized civil society; (3) government-induced employment; (4) fiscal incentives for business as well as
contractual and legal certainty in the general business
environment; and (5) freedom of the press and multiparty elections.
Social inclusiveness was found to be positively linked
with (1) coordination and planning at all levels of government; (2) promotion of political will, free expression and
other human rights; (3) new rules that promote equitable
creation of formal employment; (4) access to legally enforceable rights, and freedom of the press; (5) multiparty
elections, and (6) municipal laws that promote freedom
of cultural expression.
Political inclusiveness was found to be positively
linked with (1) freedom of expression and of the press;
(2) multiparty elections; (3) a constitutional guarantee
on cultural expression; and (4) micro-credit.
Cultural inclusiveness was found to be positively

The regional dynamics of inclusion

conditions that favour various forms of active participation, in
accordance with the various societal, cultural and organizational
forms that characterize any specific population.
It is becoming more and more accepted that recognition of
cultural diversity is essential to the construction of citizenship,
which in turn facilitates the transformation of customs, attitudes
and practices for the purposes of an enhanced democratic
culture. This broad-ranging effort is placed under the overarching
principles of respect for the rights of others, including the right
to be different, and the rights to solidarity and social inclusion,
among others. In many cases, best practice seems to derive from
close collaboration between national and local authorities, as most
surveyed experts recognized. In Oruro, for instance, the new State
Constitution (2009) recognizes the political rights of all segments
of the Bolivian population, including the right of indigenous
peoples to their own autonomy, customs and traditions in the
political, economic, social and cultural spheres. In other cases,
initiatives enabling cultural rights and expression are launched by
municipalities themselves. In Bogotá, for instance, in the mid1990s, mayor Antanas Mockus positioned culture as a cornerstone
in the construction of citizenship. As mentioned earlier, Bogotá’s
own declaration of cultural rights promotes cultural freedom,
pluralistic values and autonomy of individuals regardless of
cultural, social or ethnic background. In Johannesburg, cultural
inclusiveness is enshrined in the 1996 Bill of Rights, which, as
also mentioned earlier, formally grants residents the right to use
their language and to participate in the cultural life of their choice.
In eThekwini, under the 2008/09 Integrated Development Plan,
the municipality recognizes and supports cultural diversity,
providing the opportunities (in the areas of sports and recreation,
arts, culture and heritage) the population needs for individual
development, community solidarity and economic advantage.
Other cities also take tangible steps to promote cultural equity
beyond formal declarations. In Curitiba, municipal policies
enhance the roles of urban planning and the environment,
providing green areas, parks and forests that link the functions
of environmental protection, sanitation, sports, leisure, social
and cultural life. São Paulo has opened more than 40 “Unified
Education Centres” providing much-needed venues for cultural
activities in otherwise deprived areas. In Quito, best practice
includes the defense of public spaces and recovery of areas and
buildings of cultural significance, and for the enjoyment of the
whole population.

The Five Steps to an
Inclusive City
Making rights effective

Quick Facts

1.	 The benefits of an inclusive city extend to the
less tangible aspects of urban and community
life, such as sense of belonging, identity and
place. The concepts of human relationships,
citizenship and civic rights are all inseparable
from urban inclusiveness.
2.	 The rights recognized in constitutional or
national laws remain largely notional, and it is
for municipal authorities to make them effective
with central and local government support.
This is especially the case with cultural and
political rights.
3.	 Institutions are now seen at the centre of
efforts to promote sustainable development
and reduce poverty and inequality. For the
moment, existing rules and institutions are
too often perceived as favouring the rich and
powerful.
4.	 Information technologies can turn the
relationship between municipal authorities
and the community from a one-way into a twoway process, streamlining procedures and
enhancing transparency.

n inclusive city can be defined and personally
experienced in many different ways by its
residents. Still, as suggested in this Report,
inclusive cities share a number of basic features
that take different shapes in various conditions. Any inclusive
city provides the opportunities and supportive mechanisms
that enable all residents to develop their full potential and gain
their fair shares of the “urban advantage”.1 As suggested in
Part 2, this “advantage” includes access to all aspects of basic,
decent living conditions such as housing, transportation,
education, recreation, communication, culture, religion,
employment and the judiciary, among others. These benefits
also extend to the less tangible aspects of urban or community
life, such as experiencing a sense of belonging, identity and
place. In an inclusive city, residents perceive themselves as
important contributors to decision-making, ranging from
political issues to the more mundane routines of daily lives.
Active participation guarantees all residents a stake in the
benefits of urban development. The concepts of human
relations, citizenship and civic rights are all inseparable from
urban inclusiveness.
Rights: From paper to reality
The local experts who participated in the 2009 UNHABITAT Policy Analysis on the Inclusive City concurred
that if municipal authorities are to foster inclusiveness in their
cities, they must look beyond constitutional or national laws
and the associated perfunctory lists of recognized rights and
duties. Municipal authorities must also lay down the specific
conditions that will make all declared rights effective. As an
expert in Quito made quite clear, “Las ciudades deben pasar del
papel a la realidad” (cities must move from paper to reality).2
This said, however, the policy analysis also reveals a substantial
degree of confusion with regard not only to the meaning and
scope of declared rights, but also to the way these rights are to
become effective on a day-to-day basis.

As noted in Chapter 3.2, the process of turning rights
into tangible improvements in economic, social, political,
and cultural inclusion begins with the recognition that the
four dimensions of inclusion are inter-related. Municipal
authorities make significant progress in bridging the urban
divide when they integrate all dimensions of inclusion into
policies. This is especially so where cities enhance each
dimension of inclusion simultaneously, granting each equal
priority in city governance, planning, management and
implementation. Still, how can cities make multi-dimensional
inclusion a tangible reality? What are the elements of success?
What are the steps and catalysts that can bring or trigger
change?
Based on UN-HABITAT survey returns, this final chapter
lays down a series of practical steps and catalytic levers which
municipal authorities can make and activate to bridge the
urban divide.
Five steps to an inclusive city
UN-HABITAT policy analysis identifies five major steps to
an inclusive city:
1.	assessing the past and measuring progress;
2.	establishing new, more effective institutions, or strengthening existing ones as needed;
3.	building new linkages and alliances across tiers of government;
4.	developing a sustained, comprehensive vision to promote
inclusiveness; and
5.	ensuring an equitable redistribution of opportunities.

Assessing the past and
measuring progress
The beauty and the challenge of urban space is that no two
cities are alike. Each has its own history, economy, politics,
social dynamics, cultural style and, above all, human potential.
Understanding how these have come together over time in a
particular city is a crucial step for any municipal authority
committed to promoting inclusion. This comprehensive
assessment will determine what the next four steps must
involve, and what they require from the various stakeholders,
with regard to institutional strengthening, coordination
between various tiers of government, building and projecting
a vision, and distribution of opportunities. This assessment
will also provide the benchmark against which policies and
practices can be measured, enabling municipal authorities to
monitor progress and evaluate performance.

1.	 The way municipalities perform their duties
is just as important as the nature of what they
achieve.
2.	 It takes four steps to close the urban divide:
new or strengthened, more effective
institutions; new linkages and alliances
across the three tiers of government; a
sustained, comprehensive vision to promote
inclusiveness; and ensuring an equitable
redistribution of opportunities.
3.	 A city “vision” is not a fiction. It is based
on a realistic assessment of current assets
and comparative advantage, building on
this potential to take advantage of future
opportunities to fulfill the aspirations of a whole
community.
4.	 It takes five levers to integrate the poor
and marginalized into mainstream urban
life: improved quality of life, investment in
human capital formation, sustained economic
opportunities, enhanced political inclusion, and
cultural inclusion.
5.	 Cash transfers linked to health- or educationrelated conditions are increasingly found to be
the best way of enhancing both incomes in the
short run and capabilities in the longer term.

The Five Steps to an Inclusive City

Some additional factors may be needed, the specific
nature of which will vary from one city to the other. In this
endeavour, and given the many dimensions of inclusiveness,
effective coordination of municipal authorities with local and
central government has a pivotal role to play.

Confronting the past is a difficult but necessary exercise.
As stressed throughout this Report, exclusion builds and
perpetuates over time. Cities do not divide overnight. They are
the product of contested development over generations, often
fierce competition for land, labour and capital, for political
representation and identity, and for basic human dignity. In
Brazil, for instance, the end of military dictatorship in 1988
gave way to democratic practices both at national and local
scales. The “right to the city” became a municipal expression
of the broader opening at the national level (see Chapter 3.1).
But then it would take many years, and a succession of leaders
both national and municipal, just to begin to address the root
causes of exclusion, and a decade to align policy and public
capital investment with constitutional prerogative.
If the direction of change is to be realistically determined, and
the political, social, institutional and financial requirements
of reform to be accurately anticipated, understanding
the evolution of a city is an essential prerequisite. Equally
crucial is the process through which such an assessment is
undertaken. Just like its intended outcome, a situation
analysis of a city should be inclusive, i.e., involve municipal
authorities, the business, utility and financial sectors, social
movements, micro-finance institutions, private developers,
investors and any relevant central government departments.
The various local stakeholders each bring with them a distinct
perspective and set of interests. As they help assess where the
city has come from, they will also feel more committed to its
future pathway.

A desired by-product of inclusive analysis is a monitoring
framework with well-determined baseline conditions.
In addition to demographic and health indicators, this
framework can also capture the current condition and
potential of municipal institutions. Since bridging the urban
divide involves complex challenges and long-term solutions,
it is important that any performance indicators can measure
all aspects of inclusion, both the desired outcomes and the
processes that can lead to them.

More effective, stronger institutions
Most of the experts participating in the UN-HABITAT
urban policy analysis in the developing world agreed that
existing rules and institutions are creations of the rich and
powerful, and frequently cater solely to their interests with
little regard for those of other social groups, particularly the
poor. However, this negative perception is not held by all of
the respondents; some have identified a new development
paradigm that places institutions at the centre of efforts
to promote sustainable development and reduce poverty
and inequality – in the process recognizing the specific
moral leverage of institutions and their power of social
transformation.
Today, evidence from successful cities shows that the way
municipalities perform their duties is just as important as
the nature of what they achieve.3 Inclusive cities conduct indepth reviews of their systems, structures and institutional

interest or focus), and as a result laws and policies do not
achieve intended goals. For example, cultural prejudice and
social bias are major factors behind exclusive access to the social
venues and other amenities enjoyed by certain social groups,
although national constitutions and other legal instruments
may guarantee freedom of access. Fewer than 25 per cent of
all respondents to the UN-HABITAT survey felt their city’s
institutional and organizational capacities were apt to address
pervasive prejudice and bias; as far as urban populations are
concerned, this situation can only cause disillusionment with
the capacity of the system to respond to their needs, especially
among marginalized and vulnerable groups.
New institutions or new channels
Those cities and countries that have effectively brought
about institutional change and reforms have resorted to two
main types of strategies. The more widespread one involves
the creation of dedicated agencies to oversee public efforts to
advance the rights and interests of the public (whether those
of the citizenry at large or of specific, excluded groups). An
alternative strategy has municipal authorities establish new
institutional channels and allocate resources to specific issues
within existing institutions. The first strategic option entails
the creation of new organizations (ministries or departments)
with new sets of rules, such as dedicated mechanisms for
women’s inclusion and empowerment. Brazil provides the
most prominent example of a new ministry created (in 2003)
to take care of racial issues related to the country’s majority
Afro-descendant population.9 The second strategic option
(i.e., new, dedicated institutional channels within existing
public bodies) has seen the government of Australia improve
social inclusion through reinforced coordination of public
institutions, in a bid more directly to address the needs of
jobless families and children at risk in deeply underprivileged
communities. Since inception in 2007, this initiative has
mainstreamed the social inclusion agenda into the work of all
relevant government departments.10
Effective institutional change also requires appropriate
indicators and metrics of evaluation. These can play two
complementary roles: acting as “engines of learning”, and as
permanent mechanisms whereby institutions, programmes
and systems are revised, improved and adapted. In South
Africa, for instance, the municipality of Tshwane (which
includes Pretoria) has set up a monitoring and evaluation
unit; on top of reviewing and amending the city’s “vision” and
monitoring overall progress towards targets and benchmarks,
the unit promotes stakeholder engagement and transparency.
The unit assesses structures, processes and outcomes of
existing and newly created institutions against clearly defined
indicators. These combine with knowledge systems that keep
a record of the process and facilitate the sharing of experiences
and practices.11
In other cases, information technologies have done more
than improve data processing: they have provided advanced
decision support systems that strengthen institutions. In São

The Five Steps to an Inclusive City

mechanisms; beyond enhancing the performance of
development-related institutions, these cities look to improve
methods and procedures to pave the way for genuine
institutional change. The UN-HABITAT policy analysis
identified many best practices with regard to municipal
evaluation and adaptation. Almost all the cities surveyed are
governed by some form of municipal statute and administrative
bodies in charge of enforcement; but some perform better than
others when it comes to evaluating and amending municipal
mandates and enlarging the scope of governance to pressing
issues of social, political and cultural inclusiveness. São Paulo,
for instance, revised its municipal charter in 2003 to place
“inclusive” issues like health, education, the environment,
food security, the needs of elderly people and social welfare,
among others, at the top of its agenda.4 Establishing new
institutions and strengthening existing ones is, in itself, a
societal transformation process that requires national and
local ownership. In this respect, Johannesburg provides a
particularly good instance of proper coordination between
central and municipal government: local implementation of
the 1996 national “Growth, Employment and Redistribution
Policy” required a restructuring of public sector institutions
in the city and deployment of new policy frameworks for the
delivery of social services, in order to match the mandates set
out by central government.
In any city, institutional change requires periodic reviews
of and amendments to municipal mandates, together with
critical monitoring of institutional effectiveness to make sure
policies keep adjusting to urban change. Previous research by
the Asian Development Bank identified Quezon City in the
Philippines as an apt example of a new urban development
strategy, complete with a well-adjusted legal framework that
has the potential to facilitate locally owned organizational
change.5 Similarly, the government of West Bengal in India
has established a “Change Management Unit” to supervise the
implementation of programmes that reduce poverty, enhance
quality of life and improve access to basic services in Kolkata
– a recognized best practice. This innovation is one of the
Kolkata municipality’s systemic efforts to deploy innovative
strategies and structures for the sake of better accountability
of local resource management.6
Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz has established
that if socioeconomic development is to happen, it must
involve an active role for government. This in turn requires
strong institutions that guarantee systems efficiency, along
with the procedures needed to evolve consensus around
societal values and the new codes of conduct that enable any
society to function well.7 In Rwanda, for instance, the Imihigo
(“challenging oneself ”) programme focuses on performance
management of local authorities across the country, in the
process enabling communities and local leaders to develop a
culture of cooperation in pursuit of common goals.8
Laws and policies require enforcement institutions.
However, the UN-HABITAT policy analysis shows that a
number of cities fail to establish such institutions (owing to
limited institutional or organizational capacities, or lack of

153

Paulo, for instance, the social housing department in 2005
deployed a dedicated information system which, on top of
providing information on the main housing indicators, also
operates as a set of rules that automatically signal which
aspects of each programme call for priority attention at any
one time. This set-up facilitates both institutional efficiency
and acceptance of resource deployment rules by the relevant
communities.12

Building new relations and alliances
across tiers of government
Today in many countries, decentralization gives sub-national
authorities ample autonomous powers for policymaking and
public spending, at least notionally. In practice, however, it
appears that lower tiers of government remain well short of
the human and financial resources they need, especially when
it comes to reducing structural forms of inequality. In other
countries, local authorities lack the institutional autonomy,
the resources and the mandates to address any of the four
dimensions of inequality. Consequently, in both groups
of countries, municipal authorities often depend on the
policies, programmes and fiscal/budget initiatives of central
governments.

Routine links for results

Some cities have managed to mobilize capacities to develop
innovative programmes and actions, deploying both greater
“entrepreneurship” and more resources to maximize comparative advantage and geographic endowment. It cannot be
stressed too strongly, though, that even such dynamic municipalities can achieve little if they fail to develop strategic alliances
that combine policies and resources with other tiers of government as well as the private and public sectors. The crux of their
success is their understanding that local innovation mostly
relies on national institutions and central budget allocations,
particularly in the implementation phase. Efficient linkages
among different tiers of government and civil society also ensure greater sustainability of local programmes, as findings of
the UN-HABITAT Policy Analysis on the Inclusive City suggest. The analysis identifies several innovative instances where
institutional inter-linkages routinely reduce urban inequalities.
In Cartago, Costa Rica, for example, public-private collaboration in the issuance of so-called “municipal bonds” has raised
much-needed resources for local development. Under this
scheme, mortgage banks sell bonds to the central government
(instead of individual or institutional investors) and transfer
the proceeds to municipal authorities in support of local infrastructure improvements.13 Ghana’s capital, Accra, provides another noteworthy example. Thanks to financial backing from
central government and in a bid to promote education and
social inclusiveness, the municipality has abolished all forms of
levies and school fees in government-run schools. These have
been replaced by a capitation grant which, combined with free
school buses, has led to an increase in enrolments.14

Bridging the political gaps: Share and collaborate
Experience shows that at the root of successful collaboration
lies an institutional and managerial capacity to share resources
such as staff, skills, funding, information and knowledge for
mutual benefit. This capacity, in turn, derives from constant
dialogue and interactions among public authorities. This is
particularly the case in democratic societies, exposed as they
are to the endless succession of breakdowns, negotiations and
alliances that characterize day-to-day relationships among
the three tiers of government, and against a background of
political differences and shifts in ruling parties, ideologies
and policies. Bogotá provides an apt example of effective
collaboration that has not allowed the political ebb and flow
to interfere with major innovations of an inclusive nature.

The city’s innovative programmes and policies involve
a universal, comprehensive health care programme that
includes schemes known as “Health at home” and “Health at
school” and is funded by the central government budget. The
programmes achieve universal health care provision through
due regard for local conditions. “Bogotá without Hunger”
is another initiative that meshes the local with the national,
providing food to local children free of charge thanks to
central government funding.15
Another lesson from successful cities is that inequalities
emphasize the need for interventions that are sensitive to
local requirements and circumstances. Central government
policies must fully take these particular conditions into
account, while at the same time proposing solutions
that are replicable and can be scaled up nationwide. In a
number of cases, two-way collaboration between local and
central authorities has resulted in a gradual expansion of
functions and capacities that were traditionally assigned to
local governments (basic infrastructure, urban transport,
management of public spaces) to include more complex areas
(resource management, environmental protection, promotion
of competitiveness, capital investment, financing and other
productive functions). In some cases, municipalities have
also gained control over provision and regulation of health
services, housing and education. Admittedly, these changes
are occurring with variable intensities in a number of cities
across the developing world.16
Adjusting national mandates
As part of the two-way local-national coordination process,
central governments are also adjusting their own mandates
and responsibilities – developing macro-economic and
industrial policies, implementing nation-wide reforms,
deciding on regional choices and allocations of resources,
mobilizing public and private investments, and supervising
and monitoring the implementation of a variety of
decisions. These new configurations provide opportunities
to develop various forms of coordination and synergies,
testing new methods or solutions on an ongoing basis. This
is where free political expression and freedom of association
and participation have essential roles to play, ensuring
accountability and transparency as improved coordination
among public authorities results in enhanced effectiveness
on the ground. Accountability also encourages collaboration
over rights-based policies with institutions and stakeholders
at national and intermediate levels; it also helps mobilize
resources and support. Two avenues are available here:
accountability can be secured either through institutionalized
channels, or through social participatory movements. A good
example of the latter is the Forum Centro Vivo in São Paulo,
which acts as a relay for residents’ demands for the right to
live in the centre of the city, as part of a broader campaign for
democracy and inclusiveness and against exclusionary types
of urban renewal.

The Five Steps to an Inclusive City

The UN-HABITAT policy analysis identifies many other
instances where this type of coordination has narrowed the
urban divide, including in Peru and Argentina. The fact that
Latin America stands out in this respect is not surprising:
the region concentrates an overwhelming majority of the
programmes that involve cooperation among the three tiers
of government. In contrast, the Asian cities under review are
characterized by a predominance of national (as opposed to
municipal) planning strategies and programmes, including for
promotion of social, economic and political equality. In Asia,
the intermediate (state/provincial) tier of government enjoys
some degree of autonomy, but the policy analysis found that
when it came to implementation, the involvement of, and
coordination with local authorities were relatively weak. In
the African cities under review, and apart from Johannesburg
and Accra, lack of coordination among the three tiers of
government seems to be one of the major determinants of the
high degrees of inequality highlighted in Chapter 2.2.
The experts participating in the UN-HABITAT policy
analysis concluded that it took no less than the three tiers
of government to make a city inclusive, and even a fourth
one – metropolitan-area coordinating bodies – depending on
local circumstances. In the developing world, reality is alltoo often at odds with this recommendation, as government
coordination remains patchy, poor and informal. Persistent
inability by various bodies at the three echelons of government to develop collaborative arrangements can only restrict
their capacity to act together in one and the same urban
space. In other words, poor coordination generally tends to
reinforce under-development and exclusion. It is incumbent,
therefore, on municipal authorities to display the “entrepreneurship” (i.e., a combination of initiative and dynamism)
that will earn them the recognition they need from the intermediate and central tiers of government. Such recognition
will result in a greater degree of involvement in regional and
national development strategies, paving the way for the dayto-day coordination that will put municipal authorities in a
position to tackle the urban divide in a more effective and
sustainable way.

155

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Demonstrating a sustained vision to
promote inclusiveness

156

Cities need a clear “vision” of their future – a long-term plan
that combines creativity, realism and inspiration and provides
a framework for strategic planning. The building of a city’s
future starts today, and this can only be a future to be shared
between present and future generations. This is why municipal
authorities must address the major factors behind the current
urban divide – social inequalities, poverty and exclusion.
Municipal authorities must also take into account those factors
on which communities build present and future opportunities,
including competitiveness, economic development, good
governance and sustainability.17
A city’s “vision” builds upon its specific identity, comparative
advantage and geographic endowments as well as defining
historical and cultural dimensions. It is not just a city’s function,
structure and form that its vision projects into the future, but
also a community’s dreams and aspirations.18 For this reason,
any city “vision” should always be context-driven and developed
with the participation of all segments of the population.
Too many cities in the developing world, however, lack both
vision and long-term urban development plans. Outdated
master plans are increasingly at odds with today’s realities.
Some cities have developed new plans deriving from unrealistic
visions. Many others have no shortage of good plans or ideas,
but lack the well-defined roadmaps and adequate resources
required for implementation; this leaves them in a quandary
with regard to costs and funding.
The practical import of these various shortcomings is the
same: today, in a majority of cities, urban planning practice
seems to be divorced from any long-term city vision. Many
urban dwellers wonder who is in charge of planning nowadays:
the public, developers, or politicians. This comes with a
perception that many major decisions are not guided by any
long-term community plan (see Box 3.3.1), but rather by hereand-now pressures from individual stakeholders19; this holds
even where urban plans have been devised and the municipality
is supposed to implement them through participatory
mechanisms. There is a general sentiment that implementation
rests not on resident participation, but rather on some vested
interests, preventing expected benefits from trickling down
to poor communities.20 Dhaka’s newly developed “Detailed
Area Plan” is a case in point: this highly exclusive scheme
allocates 34 per cent of available space to 4.4 million middleand upper-income people in outer Dhaka, and only 0.3 per
cent of space to 4.5 million low-income residents.21 In other
cities, though, the “vision” involves adequate plans for social
inclusion. This is the case with the Abuja Master Plan (see
Chapter 3.1), which has the potential to promote inclusiveness
and reduce inequalities – if properly implemented. However,
as one expert in Nigeria’s capital remarked, “It is the process of
implementing the dream of Abuja that is not inclusive socially,
politically or economically, not the plan itself ”.22 This resonates
with experts in other locations, such as Jaipur: “It is not the
Master Plan that is flawed, but the implementation”.23

Evolving a vision, together
The remarks of respondents to the survey component of
UN-HABITAT’s policy analysis and the experiences of others
suggest that it is not enough for a city’s vision to reflect the
shared aspirations of its whole population. Implementation
should also take on a collective dimension, since any progress
towards a more inclusive city is a collective endeavour. This
entails collaboration among all tiers of government and civil
society (business, trade unions, community groups and the
citizenry), which should prevent some interest groups from
dominating the whole process and dictating “what is best
for the city”. As noted in Chapter 3.2, the problem is that
(according to nearly half of survey respondents) residents are
not really interested in participating in the political process
that shapes a city’s future; this comes as a direct reflection
of their dissatisfaction with current participatory approaches,
which they perceive as biased or ineffective.
Considering the high degrees of complexity and abstraction
involved in the development of a vision for a city, it is advisable
to start with a preliminary general plan on which other
stakeholders can build. As Stiglitz remarks, “A development
strategy is a living document. It needs to set forth how
it is to be created, revised, and adopted; the process of
participation; the means by which ownership and consensus
is to be obtained; how the details will be fleshed out. Such a
development strategy would fulfill several functions as it sets
forth its vision for the future”.24
An open, transparent process that integrates various kinds
of urban stakeholders is in a better position to address
entrenched problems of exclusion and to propose solutions
that are appropriate both culturally and politically. Such
inclusive development of a vision and planning in turn
enhances the potential for collective ownership, as the
proposed action plan is endorsed by everyone. This two-way,
locally driven and collective process has the further benefit
of opening up viable alternatives which, here again, offer a
more widely accepted course of action. This is why adequate
conditions must be provided and enough time allocated to
revise and change initiatives, or redirect them, depending on
proper assessments of both the process and the results. For
example, and as mentioned in Chapter 3.2, the Johannesburg
municipality uses a survey to monitor satisfaction with ward
committees and other municipal bodies among households
and businesses.25
A city’s vision must be optimistic and ambitious, and at the
same time realistic. It should be laid out in concise format for
ease of communication. Above all, a city’s vision of its own
future must be comprehensive and inclusive in both statement
and purpose. For instance, the Dakar Master Plan 2025 (Plan
Directeur d’Urbanisme de Dakar à l’horizon 2025) “aims to
stop the anarchic occupation of the urban space, to address
the urban transport problem and to tackle the challenge of
slums”.26 Likewise, in Callao, Peru, the Plan de Ordenamiento
Territorial proposes to reduce social and spatial polarization
with proper land management over the next 15 years.27

Any vision should be innovative if it is to break with the
inertia of the past and bring about a qualitative leap towards
the future.28 The rationale behind Melbourne’s “Plan 2001”
was to transform the city into “one of the commercial,
industrial, intellectual, and cultural capitals of the world,
while retaining a global leadership as a livable city”. A
vision should also be attractive and focused. With its “Plan
1995”, Rio de Janeiro aimed “to become a metropolis with
increasing quality of life, socially integrated, respectful of
public life, and confirming its vocation for culture and
joie de vivre”.29 The Colombo “Corporate Plan” envisions
the Sri Lankan capital as “a model city in Asia, a caring
organization looking after the interests of citizens and users
with an efficient, quality service for creation of safe, healthy
and wealthy living conditions”.30
A vision, not a fiction

Pablo Vaggione, Francisco Perez Arellano*
As builders of bridges between present and future, urban planners are
in a good position to help define and implement “visions” for inclusive
cities – if only they would revisit the dynamics of the profession. Combining the broad perspective of the generalist and the focused expertise
of the specialist, planners can better understand the interdependencies
among various urban functions like land use policy and unemployment,
transportation and poverty, economic development and education. Proactive, agile and plain-talking planners can provide both leadership and
coordination to multi-disciplinary, participatory municipal teams.
The planning function must reclaim public space and improve urban
conditions for all. Spatial planning can facilitate access to equal opportunities for everyone’s development. Planners can work with communities and civil society, assessing grassroots demands and requirements,
jointly devising community-based projects, facilitating public participation, mediating in negotiations and providing technical assistance in
project implementation. In Cato Manor, eThekwini, South Africa, an
integrated, participatory urban planning process has evolved a broad
consensus on a development model that has since enabled the community to overcome long-standing social divides and spatial fragmentation.
With regard to infrastructure and services, planners can benchmark
alternatives, assess scenarios and deliver neutral opinions on feasibility. They can also help source innovative financial alternatives; in this
respect, Shanghai owes its success to its ability to strengthen institutional, legal and financial frameworks to attract funding which, combined with a proper master plan, has increased municipal revenue by a
multiple of 14 since 1990.
In the perspective of sustainable, inclusive cities with participatory
decision-making, planners’ assistance with master-planning and comprehensive, long-term strategies are critical for public authorities. Planners are also well-placed to help develop the policies, programmes and
capacity-building that link such strategies with the shorter term, as is
happening in Bangladesh. In Bogotá and Medellín, Colombia, the social
integration and civic transformation at the core of municipal policies
involve planners along with politicians and multidisciplinary teams.
Planning also has a most natural role to play with regard to environmental threats, and more specifically climate change. Holistic, integrated
planning is in order both for the development of new urban areas and
the renewal and upgrading of the existing city. In Curitiba, Brazil, an
innovative approach has been linking the upgrading of environmental
conditions with public transport and land use planning.
As a group of eminent planning experts recognized in the Global Report
on Human Settlements 20091, “Among the most significant challenges
that urban planning has to address in the next few decades, especially
in developing countries, are increasing poverty and inequality, as well as
the rapidly expanding urban informal sector.” The planning profession is
determined to meet this challenge.

The Five Steps to an Inclusive City

For all its innovative features and focus on the longer term,
any “vision” must be realistic and feasible. Short of detailing
how it is to deliver on clear goals, a vision will sound like
little else but a catchphrase. Nairobi Metropolitan’s “Vision
2030”, for example, “is to be a world-class metropolis, first
and foremost in Africa ... for which it will create a sustainable
world-class living and working environment”.31 Any “vision”
must be accountable, and therefore come complete with
(a) deliverable milestones, (b) mechanisms for review,
monitoring and civil society feedback, and (c) capacity for
revision and amendment based on built-up experience.
A vision is not only a broad statement. It must give a
clear sense of direction: where the city is heading, and
the key steps that will take it in that direction, including
the first, second and last ones. In this sense, far from
being a fiction, a “vision” is a plan, a roadmap, and a
commitment that is made by city authorities (who are
the leaders, custodians and promoters of the vision) and
the other tiers of government and civil society (who are
major stakeholders in the process). The strength of the
commitment will be a function of some of the elements
outlined above: effective coordination with intermediate
and central tiers of government, and participatory
formulation of the “vision” and how it is to become a
reality. For instance, in South Africa, the eThekwini
Municipality’s “Integrated Development Plan 2010 and
Beyond” is based on eight distinct sub-plans, each of which
comes complete with specific goals, strategic focus areas and
associated programmes, major projects, budget allocations
for desired outcomes, and performance indicators.32
Indeed, turning a vision into a workable plan requires
not just activities, projects and monitoring mechanisms,
but also budgets with clearly defined funding sources. In
Dakar, the above-mentioned Plan Directeur d’Urbanisme
is now halfway through implementation, having secured
permanent funding (including contributions from
individual municipalities in the conurbation and several
other national sector-specific projects).33

In conclusion, a sustained vision requires a high dose
of imagination and creativity, along with a good many
arguments and counter-arguments, which together combine
into a comprehensive, final, shared solution, including the
nuts of bolts of the implementation process and the funding
required to turn the vision into action. Any city “vision” can
only be rooted in common, solid ground.

Ensuring the redistribution of
opportunities
Cities are places of opportunity. They act as engines of
national economies through which wealth creation, enhanced
social development and employment can grow. The urban
environment also is the primary locus for innovation, industrial
and technological progress, entrepreneurship and creativity.34
Strong empirical evidence confirms that the concentration of
people and productive activities in cities provides economies
of scale and network effects that can dramatically reduce the
costs of production and stimulate growth. Cities also produce
economies of proximity, a phenomenon that involves a wide
range of occupations such as “crafts; social and personal
services such as doctors, teachers; administrative activities,
such as government and justice; and finally, consumersupport activities, such as after-sales service and customization
[which together] provide value-added close to the end-user”.35
Together with economies of scale, economies of proximity
greatly reduce unit costs for collective basic services like piped
water, sewers and drains, electricity, solid waste collection,
public transport, health care, schools and many other social
amenities and services.36

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Springboard, or quagmire?

158

As a concentration of people and productive activities, a
city can become a problem if it is inadequately planned or
poorly governed, or when distributional policies are lacking
or dysfunctional. The distribution of opportunities across
the population can become skewed or inequitable, with large
numbers hardly able to meet their basic needs, not to mention
reaping the benefits of the “urban advantage”. A springboard
for the few, the city can become a quagmire for the many –
often literally.
Many cities face the intense social and economic problems
that come with divided societies: partitioned spaces, social,
inter-generational and cultural divides, and poor political
integration, among others. On top of this by now all-toofamiliar predicament, many cities also face emerging risks
in connection with climate change, diseases on pandemic
scales and shortages of food and water. And they do so as
they already find themselves in no position to deliver health,
safety and security for all. However, all these challenges are
outnumbered by opportunities: cities will continue to stand
at the crossroads of an interdependent world, producing the

bulk of ideas, trade, innovation and creativity, together with
the necessary institutions and other forms of financial and
intellectual capital that can be used to overcome, or exacerbate,
the urban divide.37
Proactive cities can redistribute opportunities in many
different ways. For instance, the municipality of Medellín has
made massive investments in education in a bid to break the
cycle of violence and narrow the urban divide. The challenge
for the Colombian city lay not so much with access but
rather the quality of schooling in the poorer barrios or slums.
The response took the form of a variety of educational and
nutritional programmes, especially for children under 6 years
old.38 Some cities opt to focus on transportation, with vast
infrastructure plans spread out over many years to improve
connections for poor communities, in the process expanding
social and economic opportunities. In Johannesburg, for
instance, 95 per cent of the infrastructure in the township
of Alexandra has been upgraded, on top of massive capital
investment in public transport and improved housing.
The benefits combine additional affordable housing, job
creation and a more dynamic local economy through better
connections between slums and employment opportunities in
the wider area.39
Creating or opening up opportunities:
The five levers of inclusiveness
The five steps recommended above provide municipal
authorities with the strategic framework they need to map out
progress towards an inclusive city. Once they have reviewed the
factors, including historical and cultural, that are specific to
their city and adjusted the institutional and policy frameworks
as required, the next step for municipal officials is to build a
vision. Having laid out the foundations, policymakers can
undertake over time to bridge the urban divide through a
more equitable distribution of opportunities.
Since this is an open-ended phase, some sort of template
is in order. UN-HABITAT has identified five levers which
any city must activate if it is to bridge the urban divide and
integrate excluded or marginalized groups. The first one is of
a general nature (granting the right to lead a decent life), but
the other four overlap with social, economic, political and
cultural rights and inclusion. Together, the five levers are apt
to create fresh opportunities for the underprivileged, allowing
them to move away from the wrong side of the urban divide
and to turn into fully empowered citizens, responsible parents,
professionals, entrepreneurs, or otherwise full members of
society.
The five levers of inclusiveness are as follows:
1.	improve the quality of life, especially for the urban poor;
2.	invest in human capital formation;
3.	foster sustained economic opportunities;
4.	enhance political inclusion; and
5.	promote cultural inclusion.

Of course, cities are not combating exclusion all by
themselves. New opportunities in urban areas come as the
result of combined efforts by the three tiers of government, civil
society (the private sector, non-governmental and communitybased organizations) and participating communities.
As suggested in the previous chapter, economic, social,
cultural and political opportunities tend to reinforce each
other. This can only emphasize the importance of a rightsbased approach to development, and one that is holistic
(including the right to live a decent life) with decent
employment and civil and political rights (including the right
to cultural difference).

1. Improve quality of life, especially for
the urban poor.
If a large segment of the city’s population lacks adequate
shelter, water and sanitation, and lives in overcrowded
conditions without access to minimum health care and
education, it is highly unlikely that this social group benefits
from the other advantages that cities have to offer. Creating
the conditions for improved access to safe and healthy shelter,
basic services and social amenities such as health and education
is essential to any individual’s physical, psychological, social
and economic well-being.40 This is the starting point not just
for better individual lives, but also for collective sustainable
development, as the urban poor come to make the best of
their individual and collective rights and potentials.
Successful urban schemes or policies integrate various
sector-specific components as part of holistic social policies.
For instance, in Brazil, the federal government has increased

the budget for housing and expanded the supply side of
the market through changes to home loan regulations.
Concomitantly, the government has increased capital
investment in urban infrastructure in favelas, or slum areas,
through the so-called “Growth Acceleration Programme”
(Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento). More recently, the
Brazilian government launched the “My Home, My Life”
(Minha Casa, Minha Vida) programme, providing substantial
support to the housing sector in a bid to build one million
homes in five years.41 This housing programme is associated
with vigorous steps in the areas of education, cash transfers
and job creation for the poor. The rationale behind these
combined efforts is to make the right to housing and the right
to the city more effective, beyond their nominal recognition
in Brazil’s Constitution and Statute of Municipalities (see
Chapter 3.1).
In South Africa too, a similar combination of the
Constitution and the legislation on municipal authorities
makes provision of basic services to the poor mandatory.
Accordingly, the Johannesburg City Council provides free-ofcharge water (6kl), electricity (50kw), sanitation, and solid
waste removal, together with an exemption of assessment rates
on properties (valued under ZAR20,001, or US$2,650). In
Viet Nam since 1992, Ho Chi Minh City has been deploying
the so-called “Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction
Fund”, a scheme that has helped reduce the proportion of
poor people in the city over the past 15 years. The scheme has
funded the construction of thousands of free homes for the
poor, as well as infrastructure in underprivileged and remote
areas and various welfare programmes (education, health care
and employment).42

2. Invest in human capital formation.
(e.g., globalization and demand-driven policies). Cities and
regions are well-placed to ensure strategic coordination
between the institutions and various stakeholders involved
in human capital formation, and to design policies that are
well-adjusted to local needs. Cities can also offer improved
communication mechanisms to strengthen the internal and
external partnerships that are required to create and reinforce
learning communities.43

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Current literature provides abundant evidence that human
capital formation is a prerequisite for urban development
and a more equitable distribution of benefits. Experts believe
that regions and cities are the more appropriate scales for the
interface between the formation and use of human capital.
In this regard, cities must remain well aware that they do not
operate in isolation. Municipal authorities must fully take
into account their various interactions with the national (e.g.,
education, the labour market) and supranational spheres

In order to encourage human capital formation, municipal
authorities can also deploy dedicated programmes to enhance
the individual knowledge, skills and abilities that in turn pave
the way for personal, social and economic well-being. Human
capital development should not be measured only in terms
of skills, outputs and related economic benefits, though; it
also contributes to the non-economic aspects of development,
such as character building, civic awareness, appreciation of
the arts and humanities, etc.44

3. Foster sustained economic
opportunities.45

The power of conditional cash transfers
In close cooperation with national governments, a number of
cities in the developing world are implementing various forms
of social security or protection schemes in a bid to expand access
to economic opportunities for those traditionally excluded
from mainstream wealth creation and economic development.
In this respect, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) stand out
as the most efficient poverty reduction mechanism. These

4. Enhance political inclusion.
Over the past few years, the concepts of political inclusion
and participation have gained considerable currency in the
cities of many developing countries. Today, more and more
municipal and national authorities share the same basic
philosophy: bringing government within the reach of ordinary
people through enhanced mutual engagement.
Regrettably, in many places these concepts are no more
than that – they have no bearing on reality. The old order
of things – centralized, top-down, rigid methods – remains

The Five Steps to an Inclusive City

A number of cities develop specific initiatives to address
systemic failures in economic inclusion, but some of
these responses are not necessarily of an economic nature.
For instance, a regulatory framework can be adjusted to
facilitate the creation of pro-poor policies, some of which
can also favour overall economic growth, if only over time.46
Participatory decision-making mechanisms can also be
designed to facilitate the engagement of the urban poor, since
“they have the ability to influence those local decisions and
policies that greatly determine the ‘pro-poorness’ of local
strategic planning, priority setting and capital investments”.47
The 2009 UN-HABITAT survey found that participatory
planning and expression of political will, legal certainty and
democratic institutions were perceived as key determinants of
urban economic inclusion (see Chapter 3.2). Granting secure
tenure (though not necessarily property titles) to the urban
poor has also been identified as another effective long-term
solution, since this security, an appreciating asset, provides an
adequate base for business activities.48
Cities can also stimulate sustained economic growth for
poor and underprivileged populations through promotion
of labour-intensive work methods, principally in the public
works and construction industry, as well as support for smallscale enterprises and the informal sector. Survey results (see
Chapter 3.1) showed that in Latin America, policies and
schemes favouring government-induced creation of specific
forms of employment ranked, along with micro-credit, as the
most effective ways of reducing inequalities of income and
opportunities. According to several studies, savings and credit
schemes are more appropriately organized at community
level, where they can benefit from the support of civil society
organizations.49

schemes enhance incomes in the short run and capabilities
in the long term.50 They consist in direct subsidies (a small
amount every month) to poor households that meet certain
conditions in the areas of health and education, such as
enrolling children in government-run schools, getting regular
medical check-ups and vaccinations, etc.
Brazil runs the largest such scheme in the world, known as
Bolsa Familia (“family stipend”), with more than 11 million
poor families as beneficiaries (or 46 million individuals in
the country’s 5,563 municipalities). As part of the “Hunger
Zero” initiative, this scheme has contributed to a 50 per cent
reduction in poverty between 2003 and 2008.51 In Mexico,
the “Oportunidades” (“opportunities”) scheme launched
in 1997 has resulted in such a substantial reduction in the
poverty gap that in 2009 it was introduced in urban areas.
Cash transfer schemes have by now become widespread in
Latin America and the Caribbean: “Familias en Acción” in
Colombia, “Red de Protección Social” (“social protection
network”, 2000) in Nicaragua, and “Bonos de Desarrollo
Humano” (“human development bonds”, 2006) in Ecuador
are the most representative in the region. Another pioneering
experience, in Bangladesh, is the “Female Secondary School
Assistance Programme” (1997), which aims to close the
gender gap after primary education.
The success of these schemes – in terms of inequality
and poverty reduction, together with their beneficial effects
on schooling, health, infant mortality and child labour,
among other issues – has facilitated replication in other
parts of the world. Today, conditional cash transfer schemes
operate in more than 12 countries, including the United
States (“Opportunity New York City”), Indonesia (“Jaring
Pengamanan Sosial”, or safety net programme), Ghana
(“Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty”) and Kenya
(“Cash Transfers for Orphans and Vulnerable Children”).
Regardless of scope (some involve only a few thousand
families), such programmes look to balance social assistance
with human capital formation.52 A word of caution is in
order here, though: as cash transfer initiatives continue to
multiply in urban areas, more rigorous monitoring and
evaluation systems are needed; more particularly, sharper
focus must be brought to bear on the real beneficiaries of
these schemes, as well as on any potential additional costs
that can take the form of disincentive costs, stigma costs and
political economy costs.53

the norm, ensconced behind supposedly participatory
mechanisms that are not only ineffective, but also lack
political or institutional legitimacy. However, other cities
resort to a variety of participatory channels and other inclusive
tools to engage civil society, residents’ associations and local
communities in decision-making and implementation.
Some of these municipalities are constantly trying out new
modes of political participation, creating permanent fora
for dialogue and negotiation. Opportunities for extended
participation can give certain groups and individuals (the
elderly, the disabled, women, and those on low incomes)
effective access to the benefits of basic rights which otherwise
could be systematically denied to them.

political debate and negotiation, including participatory
budgeting.58 In the Philippines, the Local Government Code
does more than redefine the mandates, roles and responsibilities
of local government; it also establishes a clear connection
among provincial, city, municipal and barangay (the smallest
political unit) authorities for the delivery of basic services
and various other sector-specific issues (education, tourism,
telecommunications, housing and capital investment).
Thanks to the code, innovative mechanisms have increased
local financial resources and made their management more
efficient and participatory.59
Two-way communication for more accountability
and transparency

Voice and improved conditions

State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011

Cities that are politically inclusive recognize that on top of
building trust and legitimacy, continuous interaction between
civil society and public authorities improves quality of life.
In this sense, participation is both a consequence and a cause
of improved material conditions. Additionally, when urban
areas offer enough material resources to everyone and when
residents perceive cities as places of opportunity, effective
participation can really take place. Otherwise, poverty and
dispossession become serious barriers to political inclusion,
as the poor and marginalized can easily fall victims to
manipulation by their well-to-do peers and civic leaders.54

162

Cities can only become inclusive if all residents enjoy the
possibility of being heard by the authorities. This does not
require constant participation by all in all decisions; what it
does require, instead, is a right for all to be heard and taken
seriously in matters that concern them.55 The possibility
of being heard also requires that channels for individual
or collective participation are always open for debate over
political or more technical issues that affect their interests and
those of the city at large. Such local participation has become
one of the cornerstones of modern-day democracy, and the
only way of guaranteeing full, effective exercise of the right
to the city.
Cities must promote local democracy. Recognizing
diversity and specific socio-spatial identities, and allowing all
residents the political space they need to express themselves, is
a cornerstone of any promotion of democracy and the right to
the city. It is clear that space matters in the creation of systems
of political representation and local participation structures.56
The recent demarcation of wards with elected councilors
in South African cities came as an attempt to organize
communities and local politics as part of a democratization
process that promotes civic rights, and particularly those
of previously marginalized groups.57 In Argentina, the civic
forums join with local authorities and organizations to run the
“Citizens’ Audit Programme”. Since inception in 2003, the
scheme has established 37 active forums in 65 municipalities
and 17 provinces. These forums give access to information,

Municipal authorities are increasingly resorting to
information and communication technologies to foster
participation and interaction. These go beyond improved
information sharing, as they also transform the traditional
relationships between local authorities and citizens – and
what used to be one-way communication becomes two-way.
Today in many cities, the Internet and the World Wide Web
enable communities both to influence policy decisions and
provide feedback on implementation of government projects.
This can only enhance the accountability, transparency and
effectiveness of municipal and other local authorities.
In Morocco, the municipality of Fès gives the public access
to records through an online portal. Municipal information
kiosks make administrative procedures more transparent,
reducing and eliminating bureaucratic delays. This scheme,
which is supported by the International Development
Research Centre, is now replicated in northern Ghana, where
information technology improves local governance and a
climate of transparency and cooperation encourages civic
participation.
Ultimately, of course, it is for every city to decide which
political mechanisms, participation tools and implementation
methods will make it more inclusive. Whatever their preferred
option, though, municipal authorities must establish
local information systems to evaluate the effectiveness of
their political inclusion policies; for instance, they will
need to assess whether these policies effectively enhance
the political representation of traditionally marginalized
groups. Municipalities will also want to know whether such
enhanced representation in governance systems improves
the political integration of marginalized people, such as
ethnic minorities. In other words, a municipality should
not assess participation based on such superficial indicators
as numbers of consultative meetings or participants. Since
inclusiveness is less of a notional than a substantive outcome,
municipal authorities must keep in mind that a participatory
process is a transformational tool, the effectiveness of which
is measured in the progress achieved on the way to a more
equal, inclusive city.

5. Promote cultural inclusion.

Cultural rights through government coordination

Culture has historically been left out of the conventional
international development agenda, or relegated to its fringes.
Today, more and more scholars and experts have come to
recognize that past development strategies (such as those
associated with the “Washington Consensus” on economic
reform) have failed because they “saw development as a
technical problem requiring technical solutions … [with]
little attention paid to institutional constraints or crosscultural value differences”.60
Against this background, some cities in the South have
opted for a more comprehensive perspective on development
– one where culture features as one of the levers of success.
Accordingly, their development policies integrate cultural
values, social capital, tradition and other related factors.61
At the same time, these municipalities are well aware that,
conversely, culture can easily lead to social exclusion if aspects
such as the right to diversity or free cultural expression are
not properly addressed and turned into a force for the greater
good.
As more and more municipal authorities are finding now,
the success of development policies also relies on a broader
scope – including for implementation – which takes into
account the diversity and the specific needs of communities.
More specifically, inclusive municipalities pay greater
attention to the symbolism and meanings residents attach to
local space, the sense of belonging and territoriality among
people, and optimal and sustainable use of resources by local
groups.62 This makes it possible for participatory processes
to speak to various communities’ own sense of identity and
ways of thinking, which can only encourage trust and debate.
This sense of empowerment and influence secures community
adherence and support to development projects they perceive
as promoting their own interests and values. Bridging the
cultural gap, therefore, plays a fundamental role in forging
citizenship – shaping local identities and facilitating various
forms of expression and participation.
Indeed, as Steven Friedman put it, “Cities cannot be
inclusive if people are expected to deny who they are or where
they come from, or if they are expected to relinquish their
own values and traditions, in order for them to be part of
the urban polis..On the other hand, an urban community
built purely on respect for difference cannot endure, let alone
include all who live in it because a significant degree of agreed
commonality is crucial if people are to live with one another.”63
In this sense, culture itself must be a focus of development
policies, or, as noted by Mark Brennan, “it can be seen as
presenting both the means and ends for development”.64 A
number of cities today are using culture as a transformational
tool to integrate ethnic minorities, preserve regional values,
protect the heritage in the built environment and safeguard
the linguistic and religious diversity of the city. Beyond the
sole cultural sphere, these policies together can go a long
way towards bridging the urban divide in its other – social,
political and economic – dimensions.

It is worth noting here that in urban areas, progress on
the way to more effective cultural rights is often one of the
outcomes of close collaboration among national, regional
and local authorities. In Brazil, for instance, the three tiers
of government are implementing the National Cultural
Plan (adopted in 2008), which uses the social and civic
dimensions of culture in various programmes and initiatives
that are implemented at the municipal level; these include
the National Museum Policy, the Monumenta programme,
the “Live Culture Programme” and others.65 In South Africa,
in the aftermath of xenophobic attacks in 2008, a number
of programmes have been launched in Johannesburg and
other cities to promote cultural tolerance and cohesion with
foreigners. Under these schemes, “Migrant Help Desks” have
been established and “Anti-xenophobic Awareness Campaigns”
launched in partnership with the Department of Home
Affairs and other national agencies.66 In such cooperative
efforts, local authorities focus on specifically local issues,
concentrating on rehabilitation of historic neighbourhoods,
laying out public spaces and facilities in the least favoured
urban areas, or allowing different land use patterns and
diversified social land and housing schemes for people from
different origins or social or economic backgrounds. As far as
urban planning is concerned, some municipalities eliminate
building codes and zoning standards that act as “architectural
lines of divide”, isolating and unfavourably differentiating
some neighbourhoods from others; instead, new standards
take into account gender, ethnic as well as socio-cultural and
linguistic differences, turning them into inclusionary factors
rather than allowing them to generate further exclusion.67
Many cities are making efforts to democratize access to
culture. The South African city-region of eThekwini (which
includes Durban) is upgrading and expanding cultural
venues and increasing capital investment in cultural centers.
Bogotá, Curitiba and Quito, among various other cities in
Latin America, are extending cultural policies to marginal
suburbs. In São Paulo, the “Library Bus Project” extends
access to cultural goods to children, youth and the elderly
in underprivileged neighbourhoods.68 Medellín in Colombia
is building five large public parks, each with a library or a
museum as symbols of cultural expression, social encounter
and peace in the poorest areas.69
Cities are coming to realize that cultural activities are a
significant source of growth and employment, too, with great
potential to contribute to poverty reduction. This is why they
often engage in urban renewal and rehabilitation programmes
in decaying historic neighbourhoods and traditional urban
cores, rehabilitating historic buildings as part of heritage
preservation policies. The overall rationale is to create business
opportunities for local communities and develop specific local
senses of identity.
Other cities deploy cultural initiatives to develop a sense of
space and belonging and to promote cultural diversity within
communities. Some are developing appropriate policies and

actions to foster multiple and complementary identities as
part of broader-ranging policies that reinforce citizenship
through cultural development. Cultural activities have also
contributed to building or maintaining peace and stability
within cities and regions, particularly in multi-ethnic
settings. This has been the case in Bogotá, as part of a conflict
resolution and prevention programme. In Guatemala, formal
recognition of Mayan customary law became an important
factor both of genuine reform and internal peace agreements.
These and other initiatives strengthen the role of culture
in development, recognizing it as a positive force for the
transformation of society.
Steps, levers and the inclusive city
The review of practical steps and catalytic levers suggests
that cities can, in fact, bridge the urban divide. By assessing
their past, identifying ways to strengthen their institutions,
working through relations among tiers of government,
projecting a realistic vision, and dedicating resources
equitably to redistribute opportunities, municipal authorities
demonstrate that they can foster greater inclusion. Similarly,
cities that concentrate systematically on support to the urban
poor and make long-term investment in human capital can
reduce the urban divide, just as cities that introduce levers
(CCTs, land tenure systems, etc.) to remove market barriers
can achieve far more sustainable economic opportunities.
And cities that successfully implement transparent budgeting
and two-way accountability enhance political inclusion,
just as cities that involve ethnic minorities foster cultural
inclusion. Taken together, these steps and levers constitute
a formidable set of instruments with which cities can at
once address the economic, social, political, and cultural
dimensions of inclusion.

Two cross-cutting factors implicit in the review, and which
underlie much of this Report, are political will and human
agency. In virtually all examples, successful efforts to bridge
the urban divide were produced through consensus among
diverse, often competing interests. The necessity of political
will and human agency highlights again the relevance of
the right to the city. As noted above, the concept resonates
deeply in many cities. It speaks directly to the issue of human
dignity and, as such, provides a vehicle to rally political
will and build consensus. Simply put, it is what drives the
debate. Not all cities can deploy this concept. As discussed
earlier in this Report, context is important. Many cities have
not experienced the political and cultural history that makes
the right to the city a viable instrument for social change.
Importantly, these cities are also pursuing inclusion, but elect
to bridge the urban divide by other means. Theirs is an equally
tough challenge. This is a search for politically and culturally
appropriate methods that will disrupt complacency and create
incentives for protagonists to break the status quo that too
often perpetuates inequality and exclusion.
In all cities, whether they do or do not endorse the right to
the city, the challenge is to deliver on the promise achieved
through consensus. All-too frequently, the social contract is
vulnerable to the next election or cycle of violence and fails
to translate into education, employment, citizenship, respect,
and dignity. The sheer extent of exclusion and the strength
of vested interests warrant sustained political will and human
agency over the long term.
As the results of UN-HABITAT’s policy analysis show,
closing the urban divide is not a one-off engagement. It is
a commitment among successive leaders of cities, social
movements, organized labour, businesses and the general
public to implement practical steps and catalytic levers so that
the city, in fact, becomes more inclusive over time.

Cities are constantly changing. They are built, rebuilt, destroyed, transformed, occupied by different groups, and used
for different functions. In the search for higher returns through better spatial structures, more efficient economies of
scale and other benefits, cities generate a diversity of residential patterns. In this process, they are more often than
not divided by visible and invisible borders, splitting “off-centre” and “central” areas, or the “higher” and the “lower”
districts, as the Urban Divide is colloquially symbolized in many developing countries.
The Urban Divide can be characterized by various forms of inclusion/exclusion, integration/marginalization, wealth/
poverty, equality/inequality, formality and informality. Those on the wrong side of the divide are excluded of the
benefits of urban expansion and prosperity. They are denied the urban advantage.
The most visible and measurable form of inclusion or exclusion is economic, and this Report reviews urban economic
inequality based on new data. Other social, political and cultural factors are shown to be at work, too, from the latest
research, policy analysis and available statistics. The urban poor and underprivileged – women and young people in
particular – are exposed to various types of inequality, from planning and land policies (or their absence) to a lack
of basic services, decent employment, education, nutrition, health care as well as civic and political freedoms and
opportunities.
As this new edition of State of the World’s Cities demonstrates, the “Urban Divide” concept provides a theoretical
framework that makes it possible to understand today’s urban realities, particularly in the developing world. From
a more practical perspective, the concept highlights the four critical dimensions of the divide – social, economic,
political and cultural – at work in many cities of the world today.
The findings suggest that economic growth cannot, on its own, bring the redistributive change required to address
urban exclusion. This Report advocates rights-based policies as the best way of “Bridging the Urban Divide”. These
basic rights capture the four dimensions of exclusion/inclusion and are already endorsed, if only formally, in most
national constitutions. Expert opinion from 27 representative cities pinpoints how the dynamics of inclusion can
work in three major developing regions, as well as the predictable and less predictable interconnections between
economic, social, political and cultural factors. Public authorities must tackle the four dimensions of inequality
simultaneously; and this will not be feasible short of close institutional, policymaking and financial coordination
between municipal, intermediary and central tiers of government.
This Report maps out five major policy steps across the urban divide and suggests how better to integrate the poor
and marginalized into mainstream urban life. It shows with compelling evidence that determined governments are
in a position to eliminate the divisions, and pave the way for more tolerance, diversity and social justice in the towns
and cities of this world.
