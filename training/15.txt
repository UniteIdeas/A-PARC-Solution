Goal 15: Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss
Forests cover 30 per cent of the Earth’s surface and in addition to providing food security and shelter, forests are key to combating climate change, protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population.Thirteen million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares.
Deforestation and desertification – caused by human activities and climate change – pose major challenges to sustainable development and have affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the fight against poverty.Efforts are being made to manage forests and combat desertification.
Forests
Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood.This includes some 70 million indigenous people
Forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects
Desertification
2.6 billion people depend directly on agriculture, but 52 per cent of the land used for agriculture is moderately or severely affected by soil degradation
As of 2008, land degradation affected 1.5 billion people globally
Arable land loss is estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate
Due to drought and desertification each year 12 million hectares are lost (23 hectares per minute), where 20 million tons of grain could have been grown
74 per cent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally
Biodiversity
Of the 8,300 animal breeds known, 8 per cent are extinct and 22 per cent are at risk of extinction
Of the over 80,000 tree species, less than 1 per cent have been studied for potential use
Fish provide 20 per cent of animal protein to about 3 billion people.Only ten species provide about 30 per cent of marine capture fisheries and ten species provide about 50 per cent of aquaculture production
Over 80 per cent of the human diet is provided by plants.Only three cereal crops – rice, maize and wheat – provide 60 per cent of energy intake
As many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-­‐based medicines for basic
healthcare
Micro-organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged
By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements
By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally
By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world
By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development
Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species
Promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and promote appropriate access to such resources, as internationally agreed
Take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species of flora and fauna and address both demand and supply of illegal wildlife products
By 2020, introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems and control or eradicate the priority species
By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts
Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems
Mobilize significant resources from all sources and at all levels to finance sustainable forest management and provide adequate incentives to developing countries to advance such management, including for conservation and reforestation
Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities
